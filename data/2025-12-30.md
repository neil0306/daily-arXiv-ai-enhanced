TL;DR: Moxin 7B is a fully open-source LLM developed under the Model Openness Framework, with three variants (Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, Moxin-Chinese) targeting vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, achieving superior performance through transparent training with open-source frameworks and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and open-source models like LLaMA have driven LLM popularity, there's a need for fully transparent open-source models that go beyond just sharing weights to include complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation details, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment.

Method: Developed Moxin 7B according to the Model Openness Framework with complete transparency. Created three specialized variants: Moxin-VLM for vision-language tasks, Moxin-VLA for vision-language-action tasks, and Moxin-Chinese for Chinese language capabilities. Used open-source frameworks and open data for training.

Result: The models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. All models, along with available data and code, are released to the public, supporting a healthy open-source ecosystem.

Conclusion: Moxin represents a significant step toward fully transparent open-source LLMs that move beyond simple weight sharing to complete openness in training, datasets, and implementation, enabling more inclusive research and sustainable open-source development.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.

### [2] [Hierarchical Geometry of Cognitive States in Transformer Embedding Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22227)
*Sophie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer sentence embeddings encode hierarchical cognitive structure aligned with human-annotated psychological attributes, decodable via linear/nonlinear probes beyond surface word statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While transformer language models show rich geometric structure, it's unclear if they encode higher-level cognitive organization aligned with human-interpretable psychological attributes.

Method: Created dataset of 480 sentences annotated with continuous energy scores and discrete tier labels across 7 cognitive categories. Used fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformers, evaluated recoverability via linear/shallow nonlinear probes, compared to TF-IDF baselines, and conducted nonparametric permutation tests.

Result: Both continuous scores and tier labels were reliably decodable across models, with nonlinear probes outperforming linear ones. TF-IDF performed worse, showing structure isn't just surface statistics. UMAP visualizations revealed smooth gradients and adjacent-tier confusions.

Conclusion: Transformer embedding spaces exhibit hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, though this doesn't imply internal awareness or phenomenology.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that transformer-based language models learn rich geometric structure in their embedding spaces, yet the presence of higher-level cognitive organization within these representations remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.

### [3] [SmartSnap: Proactive Evidence Seeking for Self-Verifying Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22322)
*Shaofei Cai,Yulei Qin,Haojia Lin,Zihan Xu,Gang Li,Yuchen Shi,Zongyi Li,Yong Mao,Siqi Cai,Xiaoyu Tan,Yitao Liang,Ke Li,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SmartSnap introduces self-verifying agents that proactively collect snapshot evidence during task execution, enabling scalable agentic RL by reducing verification costs and improving reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic RL faces scalability issues due to expensive and unreliable post-hoc verification methods that process verbose, noisy interaction histories, making verification costly and unreliable.

Method: Proposes Self-Verifying Agents with dual missions: complete tasks AND prove accomplishment with curated snapshot evidence. Uses 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, Creativity) to guide evidence collection, providing minimal decisive snapshots to LLM-as-a-Judge verifiers.

Result: SmartSnap enables scalable training of LLM-driven agents with performance gains up to 26.08% (8B models) and 16.66% (30B models), achieving competitive performance against large models like DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Conclusion: The paradigm shift from passive post-hoc verification to proactive self-verification solves scalability bottlenecks in agentic RL, creating efficient agents that synergize solution finding with evidence seeking.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

### [4] [The Syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic: A Minimalist Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22376)
*Zubaida Mohammed Albadani,Mohammed Q. Shormani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of qulk-clauses ('I said') in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic within Minimalist Program framework, proposing they are biclausal structures with qulk as clause-embedding predicate selecting CP complements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the syntactic structure of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic and contribute to generative syntax theory, particularly Minimalist Program, by analyzing this dialect-specific construction.

Method: Apply Minimalist Program operations (Merge, Move, Agree, Spell-out) to analyze qulk-clauses as biclausal structures, using Morphological Merger for post-syntactic processes, and examine dialect-specific features like bipartite negation and cliticization.

Result: Qulk-clauses are analyzed as biclausal structures where qulk functions as clause-embedding predicate selecting CP complements, with derivation proceeding through standard minimalist operations and post-syntactic processes.

Conclusion: The study contributes to generative syntax/minimalism, raises questions about extending analysis to addressee-clause 'kil-k' ('you said'), and provides insights into the universality of minimalist principles.

Abstract: This study investigates the syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) within the Minimalist Program. The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding. The findings offer theoretical contributions to generative syntax, specifically minimalism. The study concludes raising theoretical questions concerning extending the analysis to the addressee-clause kil-k 'you said'. It also provides insights into the possibility of the universality of minimalism.

### [5] [Towards Efficient Post-Training via Fourier-Driven Adapter Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22378)
*Donggyun Bae,Jongil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using Fourier features to enable frequency-aware modulation of language model representations, achieving competitive performance with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach that can selectively modulate different frequency components of language model representations, allowing for more effective adaptation while preserving the backbone model's capacity.

Method: Incorporates random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules to decompose intermediate representations into low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information through adaptive weighting mechanisms.

Result: Consistently achieves competitive or superior performance on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead.

Conclusion: FAA is a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework, termed Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA), for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models. By incorporating random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules, FAA decomposes intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information. This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms, highlighting FAA as a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models.

### [6] [LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection for Few-Shot Wearable-Sensor Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22385)
*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework improves few-shot Human Activity Recognition by using LLM-generated semantic priors to select better exemplars, outperforming traditional geometric-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HAR methods rely on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which fails to distinguish similar wearable sensor activities like walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs.

Method: Incorporates semantic reasoning via LLM-generated knowledge priors (feature importance, inter-class confusability, exemplar budget multipliers) combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization for exemplar selection.

Result: Achieves macro F1-score of 88.78% on UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, outperforming classical approaches like random sampling, herding, and k-center.

Conclusion: LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address a key limitation in state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods: their reliance on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which often fail to distinguish similar weara-ble sensor activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

### [7] [Hallucination Detection and Evaluation of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22416)
*Chenggong Zhang,Haopeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HHEM framework reduces hallucination evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes while maintaining high accuracy (82.2%), though struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination evaluation methods like KnowHalu have high computational costs, creating a need for more efficient detection frameworks that maintain accuracy while reducing resource requirements.

Method: Propose Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments. Use segment-based retrieval for localized hallucination detection in summarization tasks. Conduct comparative analysis across LLMs using TPR, TNR, and Accuracy metrics on QA and summarization tasks.

Result: HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes. HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves highest accuracy (82.2%) and TPR (78.9%). Larger models (7B-9B parameters) show fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models exhibit higher instability. Segment-based retrieval improves detection of localized hallucinations in summarization.

Conclusion: Need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation. HHEM provides efficient hallucination detection but requires improvements for localized hallucination detection in summarization tasks.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a significant challenge, generating misleading or unverifiable content that undermines trust and reliability. Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \(82.2\%\) and TPR \(78.9\%\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.

TL;DR: HiFi-RAG is a hierarchical filtering RAG system that uses multi-stage pipeline with Gemini Flash for filtering and Gemini Pro for answer generation, achieving significant improvements over baselines in RAG competitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems face challenges with irrelevant information in retrieved documents and misalignment between generated answers and user intent, especially in open-domain settings.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline using hierarchical filtering: Gemini 2.5 Flash for query formulation, content filtering, and citation attribution (cost-efficient), while Gemini 2.5 Pro handles final answer generation (reasoning-focused).

Result: On MMU-RAGent validation set: ROUGE-L improved to 0.274 (+19.6%), DeBERTaScore to 0.677 (+6.2%). On Test2025 (post-cutoff knowledge): outperformed parametric baseline by 57.4% in ROUGE-L and 14.9% in DeBERTaScore.

Conclusion: HiFi-RAG demonstrates that hierarchical filtering with cost-efficient LLMs for preprocessing and powerful LLMs for final generation significantly improves RAG performance while reducing costs, winning the MMU-RAGent competition.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in open-domain settings faces significant challenges regarding irrelevant information in retrieved documents and the alignment of generated answers with user intent. We present HiFi-RAG (Hierarchical Filtering RAG), the winning closed-source system in the Text-to-Text static evaluation of the MMU-RAGent NeurIPS 2025 Competition. Our approach moves beyond standard embedding-based retrieval via a multi-stage pipeline. We leverage the speed and cost-efficiency of Gemini 2.5 Flash (4-6x cheaper than Pro) for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution, while reserving the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation. On the MMU-RAGent validation set, our system outperformed the baseline, improving ROUGE-L to 0.274 (+19.6%) and DeBERTaScore to 0.677 (+6.2%). On Test2025, our custom dataset evaluating questions that require post-cutoff knowledge (post January 2025), HiFi-RAG outperforms the parametric baseline by 57.4% in ROUGE-L and 14.9% in DeBERTaScore.

### [9] [Exploring the Vertical-Domain Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22443)
*Jie Zhou,Xin Chen,Jie Zhang,Zhe Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' accounting reasoning capabilities, establishes evaluation criteria, tests GLM-series models and GPT-4, finds GPT-4 performs best but current models still insufficient for real-world enterprise accounting applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs transform various domains, integrating them with professional fields like accounting is crucial for enterprise digital transformation. Understanding LLMs' domain-specific reasoning capabilities is essential for effective integration into accounting.

Method: Introduces vertical-domain accounting reasoning concept and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing GLM-series training data. Evaluates GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and GPT-4 on accounting reasoning tasks using different prompt engineering strategies.

Result: Different prompt strategies improve performance across models, with GPT-4 achieving strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements, especially for enterprise-level accounting scenarios.

Conclusion: While GPT-4 shows promising accounting reasoning capabilities, further optimization is needed for practical enterprise deployment. The established evaluation framework provides benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance and advancing LLM integration in professional domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping learning paradigms, cognitive processes, and research methodologies across a wide range of domains. Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.

### [10] [Constituency Structure over Eojeol in Korean Treebanks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22487)
*Jungyeul Park,Chulwoo Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Korean constituency treebanks should use eojeol (word) units instead of morphemes as terminals to separate morphology from syntax and align with dependency resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Korean constituency treebanks use morphemes as terminals, which conflates word-internal morphology with phrase-level syntax and creates mismatches with eojeol-based dependency resources, making cross-resource comparison difficult.

Method: Proposes an eojeol-based constituency representation where morphological segmentation and fine-grained POS information are encoded in a separate, non-constituent layer. Shows that Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at eojeol level under explicit normalization assumptions.

Result: The Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be aligned at the eojeol-based constituency level, enabling cross-treebank comparison and constituency-dependency conversion.

Conclusion: An eojeol-based annotation scheme preserves interpretable constituency structure while supporting resource interoperability and maintaining morphological information separately from syntactic structure.

Abstract: The design of Korean constituency treebanks raises a fundamental representational question concerning the choice of terminal units. Although Korean words are morphologically complex, treating morphemes as constituency terminals conflates word internal morphology with phrase level syntactic structure and creates mismatches with eojeol based dependency resources. This paper argues for an eojeol based constituency representation, with morphological segmentation and fine grained part of speech information encoded in a separate, non constituent layer. A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManchuTTS: A novel TTS system for endangered Manchu language using hierarchical representations and cross-modal attention to handle agglutination and data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art results with only 5.2 hours of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manchu is an endangered language with severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination, making traditional TTS approaches ineffective. There's a need for specialized methods to handle its unique linguistic characteristics.

Method: Three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) with cross-modal hierarchical attention for multi-granular alignment. Integration of deep convolutional networks with flow-matching Transformer for non-autoregressive generation. Hierarchical contrastive loss for structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. Data augmentation and construction of first Manchu TTS dataset.

Result: Achieves MOS of 4.52 using only 5.2-hour training subset (from 6.24-hour corpus), outperforming all baselines. Hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

Conclusion: ManchuTTS effectively addresses the challenges of endangered language synthesis through specialized hierarchical representations and attention mechanisms, demonstrating strong performance despite severe data constraints.

Abstract: As an endangered language, Manchu presents unique challenges for speech synthesis, including severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination. This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin. Ablations confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

### [12] [Learning When Not to Attend Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22562)
*Xuan Luo,Kailai Zhang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AHA (All-or-Here Attention) enables LLMs to dynamically switch between full attention and local sliding window attention per token, reducing up to 93% of full attention operations without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human reading behavior where we focus on current pages and only flip back when needed, the paper aims to make LLM attention more efficient by avoiding redundant global context processing.

Method: Proposes All-or-Here Attention (AHA) with a binary router per attention head that dynamically toggles between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token based on context needs.

Result: With 256-token window size, up to 93% of original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance degradation. Analysis reveals long-tail distribution in context dependency where full attention necessity decays rapidly with larger windows.

Conclusion: Full attention in LLMs is largely redundant, and efficient inference only requires on-demand access to global context, similar to human reading patterns. AHA demonstrates that decoupling local processing from global access enables significant computational savings.

Abstract: When reading books, humans focus primarily on the current page, flipping back to recap prior context only when necessary. Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.

*Zhiqiang Gao,Shihao Gao,Zixing Zhang,Yihao Guo,Hongyu Chen,Jing Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a system for multimodal conversational sentiment analysis that uses structured prompting with LLMs for sentiment sextuple extraction and ensemble methods for sentiment flipping detection, achieving competitive results in the MCABSA Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding sentiment in multimodal conversations is crucial for building emotionally intelligent AI systems, but extracting comprehensive sentiment information from multi-speaker dialogues with dynamic sentiment shifts is a complex challenge.

Method: For Subtask-I (sentiment sextuple extraction): designed a structured prompting pipeline that guides LLMs to sequentially extract sentiment components (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, rationale) with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II (sentiment flipping detection): leveraged complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers.

Result: The system achieved 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, demonstrating effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies.

Conclusion: The structured prompting approach with LLMs and ensemble methods effectively addresses the challenges of multimodal conversational sentiment analysis, showing promise for building more emotionally intelligent AI systems capable of understanding complex sentiment dynamics in conversations.

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in multimodal conversations is a complex yet crucial challenge toward building emotionally intelligent AI systems. The Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MCABSA) Challenge invited participants to tackle two demanding subtasks: (1) extracting a comprehensive sentiment sextuple, including holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, and rationale from multi-speaker dialogues, and (2) detecting sentiment flipping, which detects dynamic sentiment shifts and their underlying triggers. For Subtask-I, in the present paper, we designed a structured prompting pipeline that guided large language models (LLMs) to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II, we further leveraged the complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers. Our system achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, showing the effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies in rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

### [14] [Chain-of-thought Reviewing and Correction for Time Series Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22627)
*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T3LLM is a framework using three LLMs (worker, reviewer, student) for time series question answering with explicit correction mechanisms to improve reasoning accuracy on numerical sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for time series question answering adopt general NLP techniques and are prone to reasoning errors with complex numerical sequences. Time series data's inherent verifiability enables consistency checking between reasoning steps and original input.

Method: T3LLM uses three LLMs: worker generates step-wise chains of thought under structured prompts, reviewer inspects reasoning to identify errors and provide corrective comments, and student learns from corrected CoT through fine-tuning to internalize multi-step reasoning and self-correction.

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.

Conclusion: The T3LLM framework effectively leverages time series data's verifiability property to improve reasoning accuracy through explicit correction mechanisms and collaborative learning among specialized LLMs.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), diverse time series analysis tasks are reformulated as time series question answering (TSQA) through a unified natural language interface. However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M2G-Eval is a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in LLMs across 4 structural levels (Class, Function, Block, Line) and 18 programming languages, revealing hierarchical difficulty patterns and cross-language transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assess code LLMs at single structural granularity and limited languages, obscuring fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios.

Method: Introduced M2G-Eval framework with 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated test instances across 18 languages. Developed M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluated 30 models (28 SOTA LLMs + 2 variants).

Result: Three main findings: (1) difficulty hierarchy with Line-level easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as complexity increases; (3) strong cross-language correlations suggesting transferable programming concepts.

Conclusion: M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for multilingual code generation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of code large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in systematically evaluating their code generation capabilities, yet existing benchmarks predominantly assess models at a single structural granularity and focus on limited programming languages, obscuring fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios. We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.

### [16] [On the Role of Discreteness in Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22630)
*Ziqi Jin,Bin Wang,Xiang Lin,Lidong Bing,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes diffusion models for language generation, identifying gaps between diffusion mechanics and language-specific requirements, and proposes more text-aligned diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have appealing properties for language generation (parallel decoding, iterative refinement), but text's discrete and structured nature challenges direct application of diffusion principles. The paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing existing approaches and identifying key issues.

Method: The paper categorizes existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. It outlines five properties separating diffusion mechanics from language requirements, analyzes recent large diffusion language models, and identifies two central issues with current methods.

Result: Analysis reveals that existing approaches (continuous vs. discrete diffusion) represent structural trade-offs, each satisfying only part of the essential properties. Two key issues are identified: (1) uniform corruption doesn't respect information distribution across positions, and (2) token-wise marginal training can't capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding.

Conclusion: The findings motivate developing diffusion processes that better align with text structure, encouraging future work toward more coherent diffusion language models that address the identified limitations.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer appealing properties for language generation, such as parallel decoding and iterative refinement, but the discrete and highly structured nature of text challenges the direct application of diffusion principles. In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.

### [17] [Evaluating GRPO and DPO for Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22631)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Tamas Kozak,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO outperforms DPO in improving CoT faithfulness in LLMs, especially in larger models, with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct achieving best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning often produces misleading justifications that don't reflect actual model reasoning, undermining reliability for safety supervision and alignment monitoring.

Method: Evaluated two optimization methods - Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) - for improving CoT faithfulness across different model sizes.

Result: GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct performing best. Both show positive correlation between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics.

Conclusion: GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs by improving CoT faithfulness.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

### [18] [Fragile Knowledge, Robust Instruction-Following: The Width Pruning Dichotomy in Llama-3.2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22671)
*Pere Martra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GLU-MLP width pruning guided by MAW criterion shows selective capability effects: factual knowledge degrades but instruction-following improves, with robust multi-step reasoning and an inverse correlation between knowledge and truthfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation across all model capabilities, and to systematically characterize how structured width pruning affects different cognitive abilities in LLMs.

Method: Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers using Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, evaluating seven expansion ratio configurations across comprehensive benchmarks including MMLU, GSM8K, IFEval, MUSR, and TruthfulQA-MC2.

Result: Pruning creates a systematic dichotomy: parametric knowledge (MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity degrade predictably, but instruction-following improves substantially (+46-75% in IFEval), multi-step reasoning remains robust, and truthfulness improves as knowledge degrades (r = -0.864 inverse correlation).

Conclusion: Expansion ratio is a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities rather than just being a compression metric. MAW-guided pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving/enhancing behavioral alignment, with context-dependent efficiency trade-offs (energy savings vs. latency penalties).

Abstract: Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.

*Yoshith Roy Kotla,Varshith Roy Kotla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VACP framework reduces prediction set sizes 197x while maintaining 90% coverage for LLM uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need reliable uncertainty quantification for high-stakes applications, but standard softmax probabilities are poorly calibrated, and naive conformal prediction produces uninformatively large prediction sets.

Method: Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP) uses semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage.

Result: VACP achieves 89.7% empirical coverage (90% target) while reducing mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens - a 197x improvement in efficiency on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks.

Conclusion: VACP provides a practical solution to the coverage-efficiency tradeoff in LLM uncertainty quantification, making conformal prediction viable for large-vocabulary models with over 250,000 tokens.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains requires rigorous uncertainty quantification, yet standard softmax probabilities are often poorly calibrated. We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release our implementation for reproducibility.

### [20] [GHaLIB: A Multilingual Framework for Hope Speech Detection in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22705)
*Ahmed Abdullah,Sana Fatima,Haroon Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with focus on Urdu, using transformer models to address the underrepresentation of hope speech in NLP, especially for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hope speech is underrepresented in NLP research, with current studies focused mainly on English, creating a lack of resources for low-resource languages like Urdu. There's limited development of tools for positive online communication, and while transformers work well for hate/offensive speech detection, they haven't been sufficiently applied to hope speech across diverse linguistic settings.

Method: The authors developed a multilingual framework using pretrained transformer models (XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, UrduBERT) with simple preprocessing to train classifiers for hope speech detection. They focused on Urdu but tested across multiple languages.

Result: On the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark, the framework achieved strong performance: 95.2% F1-score for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification. Competitive results were also obtained for Spanish, German, and English.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that existing multilingual models can be effectively implemented in low-resource environments for hope speech detection, facilitating identification of positive content and contributing to more constructive digital discourse.

Abstract: Hope speech has been relatively underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.

*Anaelia Ovalle,Candace Ross,Sebastian Ruder,Adina Williams,Karen Ullrich,Mark Ibrahim,Levent Sagun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models show high task accuracy but poor reasoning-logic alignment across languages, especially in non-Latin scripts where reasoning-conclusion misalignment is 2x worse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought prompting, it's unclear if this reasoning quality transfers across different languages, creating a blind spot in multilingual evaluation.

Method: Created human-validated framework to evaluate if reasoning traces logically support conclusions across languages. Analyzed 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models. Developed error taxonomy through human annotation.

Result: Models achieve high task accuracy but reasoning often fails to support conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least 2x more misalignment than Latin scripts. Primary failures: evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps.

Conclusion: Current multilingual evaluation practices give incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities. Need reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks to properly assess cross-language reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting, but whether this reasoning quality transfers across languages remains underexplored. We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.

### [22] [Mitigating Social Desirability Bias in Random Silicon Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22725)
*Sashank Chapala,Maksym Mironov,Songgaojun Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show Social Desirability Bias when simulating human responses. Simple prompt rewording (reformulated neutral phrasing) effectively reduces this bias and improves alignment with real human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for "Silicon Sampling" to simulate population responses, but they exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB) - giving socially acceptable answers rather than reflecting real human data. Existing research on mitigating this bias in LLM-based sampling is limited.

Method: Used ANES data with three LLMs (Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini). First replicated baseline silicon sampling to confirm SDB persistence. Then tested four prompt-based mitigation methods: reformulated (neutral third-person phrasing), reverse-coded (semantic inversion), priming (encouraging analytics), and preamble (encouraging sincerity). Alignment evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals.

Result: Reformulated prompts most effectively improved alignment by reducing concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results. Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity but showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation.

Conclusion: Prompt-based framing controls can effectively mitigate inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical approach for more representative silicon samples. Simple rewording to neutral third-person phrasing works best.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \emph{priming} and \emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.

*Md Badsha Biswas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using social media data (Twitter) to enhance pregnancy outcome research by developing an NLP pipeline to identify women sharing pregnancy experiences and classify them based on outcomes (positive vs. negative).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the US, with birth defects as a leading cause. There's a need for more comprehensive research and intervention strategies for negative pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, premature birth) beyond existing datasets.

Method: The paper introduces a novel approach using publicly available social media data (especially Twitter) to enhance current datasets. It involves constructing an NLP pipeline to automatically identify women sharing pregnancy experiences, with robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies to handle challenges like imbalance, noise, and lack of structure in social media data. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight are classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative outcomes are identified as negative cases.

Result: The research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes. It provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups, with potential applications in assessing causal impacts of interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes.

Conclusion: Social media data can serve as a valuable supplementary resource for pregnancy outcome research, offering new opportunities for observational studies and intervention assessment through automated NLP-based classification of pregnancy experiences shared online.

Abstract: Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with birth defects identified as a leading cause. Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.

### [24] [WeDLM: Reconciling Diffusion Language Models with Standard Causal Attention for Fast Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22737)
*Aiwei Liu,Minghua He,Shaoxun Zeng,Sijun Zhang,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Wei Jia,Yuan Liu,Xiao Zhou,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeDLM is a diffusion language model framework using causal attention for parallel decoding with prefix caching, achieving up to 10x speedup over optimized AR engines like vLLM while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive (AR) generation in LLMs is slow due to token-by-token sequential decoding. While diffusion language models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding, they often fail to achieve practical speed gains because bidirectional attention breaks prefix KV caching, forcing repeated contextualization and undermining efficiency.

Method: WeDLM uses causal attention only, making it prefix-cache friendly. It employs Topological Reordering to move observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving logical positions, allowing masked positions to condition on all observed tokens. A streaming decoding procedure continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix while maintaining fixed parallel workload, avoiding stop-and-wait behavior.

Result: WeDLM preserves AR backbone quality while delivering substantial speedups: approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes. Comparisons against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings show diffusion-style decoding can outperform optimized AR engines in practice.

Conclusion: WeDLM demonstrates that diffusion-style decoding with causal attention and proper prefix caching can achieve practical speed advantages over optimized AR engines while maintaining generation quality, making parallel generation viable for deployment.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.

TL;DR: BioSelectTune: A data-centric framework for biomedical NER that uses hybrid superfiltering to create high-quality training data, achieving SOTA performance with only 50% of curated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain LLMs struggle with biomedical NER due to lack of domain knowledge and performance degradation from low-quality training data. Need efficient fine-tuning that prioritizes data quality over quantity.

Method: Reformulates BioNER as structured JSON generation task. Uses Hybrid Superfiltering strategy - a weak-to-strong data curation method where a homologous weak model distills a compact, high-impact training dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple BioNER benchmarks. Model trained on only 50% of curated positive data surpasses fully-trained baseline and outperforms domain-specialized models like BioMedBERT.

Conclusion: BioSelectTune demonstrates that prioritizing data quality through intelligent curation enables highly efficient LLM fine-tuning for biomedical NER, achieving superior performance with significantly less training data.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) is a foundational task in medical informatics, crucial for downstream applications like drug discovery and clinical trial matching. However, adapting general-domain Large Language Models (LLMs) to this task is often hampered by their lack of domain-specific knowledge and the performance degradation caused by low-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce BioSelectTune, a highly efficient, data-centric framework for fine-tuning LLMs that prioritizes data quality over quantity. Methods and Results: BioSelectTune reformulates BioNER as a structured JSON generation task and leverages our novel Hybrid Superfiltering strategy, a weak-to-strong data curation method that uses a homologous weak model to distill a compact, high-impact training dataset. Conclusions: Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BioSelectTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple BioNER benchmarks. Notably, our model, trained on only 50% of the curated positive data, not only surpasses the fully-trained baseline but also outperforms powerful domain-specialized models like BioMedBERT.

### [26] [Text-Routed Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Model with Explanation and Temporal Alignment for Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22741)
*Dongning Rao,Yunbiao Zeng,Zhihua Jiang,Jujian Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TEXT model combines multi-modal sentiment analysis with explanation generation and temporal alignment using MLLMs and a novel text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal sentiment analysis approaches underutilize explanations and temporal alignments between modalities, which are crucial for understanding subtle emotions in human-interaction applications.

Method: Uses MLLMs to generate explanations, aligns audio/video representations via temporality-oriented neural network (Mamba + temporal cross-attention), and implements text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion.

Result: Achieves best performance across four datasets, outperforming three recent approaches and three MLLMs. Reduces MAE to 0.353 on CH-SIMS (13.5% improvement), winning on at least 4 out of 6 metrics.

Conclusion: TEXT demonstrates that integrating explanations and temporal alignment significantly enhances multi-modal sentiment analysis performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art approach.

Abstract: Human-interaction-involved applications underscore the need for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.

*Muhammad Zain Ali,Bernhard Pfahringer,Tony Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain adaptation improves fake news detection in Urdu for XLM-R but shows mixed results for mBERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu, as a low-resource language, has received limited attention in misinformation detection research, and multilingual models struggle with domain-specific terms in fake news classification.

Method: Used staged training approach with domain-adaptive pretraining on Urdu news corpus before fine-tuning for classification; evaluated XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT models on four Urdu fake news datasets.

Result: Domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperformed vanilla XLM-R, while domain-adapted mBERT showed mixed results compared to its vanilla version.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation before fine-tuning can improve fake news detection in low-resource languages like Urdu, with XLM-R showing more consistent benefits than mBERT.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media is a widely acknowledged issue, and researchers worldwide are actively engaged in its detection. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.

### [28] [CNSight: Evaluation of Clinical Note Segmentation Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22795)
*Risha Surana,Adrian Law,Sunwoo Kim,Rishab Sridhar,Angxiao Han,Peiyu Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates different methods for segmenting clinical notes into sections, finding that large API-based models like GPT-5-mini perform best overall, while lightweight baselines work well for structured tasks but struggle with unstructured text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes are typically unstructured or semi-structured after extraction from EMR systems, making them difficult to use for secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications. Reliable section boundary identification is crucial for structuring these notes since different sections (like history of present illness, medications, discharge instructions) provide distinct clinical contexts.

Method: The researchers evaluated three approaches: 1) rule-based baselines, 2) domain-specific transformer models, and 3) large language models. They used a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV for clinical note segmentation, testing performance on both sentence-level and freetext segmentation tasks.

Result: Large API-based models achieved the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching the highest average F1 score of 72.4 across both sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines remained competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but performed poorly on unstructured freetext segmentation.

Conclusion: The results provide practical guidance for method selection in clinical note segmentation and establish a foundation for downstream applications such as information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization of clinical notes.

Abstract: Clinical notes are often stored in unstructured or semi-structured formats after extraction from electronic medical record (EMR) systems, which complicates their use for secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications. Reliable identification of section boundaries is a key step toward structuring these notes, as sections such as history of present illness, medications, and discharge instructions each provide distinct clinical contexts. In this work, we evaluate rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models for clinical note segmentation using a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV. Our experiments show that large API-based models achieve the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching a best average F1 of 72.4 across sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines remain competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but falter on unstructured freetext. Our results provide guidance for method selection and lay the groundwork for downstream tasks such as information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.

TL;DR: NepEMO: A novel multi-label emotion and sentiment classification dataset from Nepali subreddit posts with 4,462 annotated entries covering five emotions and three sentiment classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms like Reddit provide unique spaces for anonymous expression of sensitive issues, but there's a lack of datasets for analyzing emotions and sentiments in Nepali social media content, particularly during challenging events and joyful occasions.

Method: Curated and built a manually annotated dataset of 4,462 Reddit posts (Jan 2019-Jun 2025) in English, Romanized Nepali, and Devanagari script. Performed linguistic analysis including emotion trends, emotion co-occurrence, sentiment-specific n-grams, and topic modeling using LDA and TF-IDF. Compared traditional ML, DL, and transformer models for multi-label emotion and sentiment classification tasks.

Result: Transformer models consistently outperformed both traditional machine learning and deep learning models for both multi-label emotion classification and sentiment classification tasks.

Conclusion: The NepEMO dataset enables comprehensive analysis of emotions and sentiments in Nepali social media, with transformer models showing superior performance for these classification tasks, providing valuable insights for social media analysis in the Nepali context.

Abstract: Social media (SM) platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit) are increasingly leveraged to share opinions and emotions, specifically during challenging events, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and political elections, and joyful occasions like festivals and celebrations. Among the SM platforms, Reddit provides a unique space for its users to anonymously express their experiences and thoughts on sensitive issues such as health and daily life. In this work, we present a novel dataset, called NepEMO, for multi-label emotion (MLE) and sentiment classification (SC) on the Nepali subreddit post. We curate and build a manually annotated dataset of 4,462 posts (January 2019- June 2025) written in English, Romanised Nepali and Devanagari script for five emotions (fear, anger, sadness, joy, and depression) and three sentiment classes (positive, negative, and neutral). We perform a detailed analysis of posts to capture linguistic insights, including emotion trends, co-occurrence of emotions, sentiment-specific n-grams, and topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and TF-IDF keyword extraction. Finally, we compare various traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer models for MLE and SC tasks. The result shows that transformer models consistently outperform the ML and DL models for both tasks.

TL;DR: Automated pipeline for synthesizing challenging simulated environments and environment-level RL algorithm for stable agent training


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RL approaches in simulated environments were limited to semi-automated synthesis or easy tasks, with unstable simulated users and heterogeneous environments posing challenges for agentic RL

Method: (1) Unified pipeline for automated/scalable synthesis of high-difficulty but easily verifiable task environments; (2) Environment-level RL algorithm that mitigates user instability and performs advantage estimation at environment level

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on agentic benchmarks (tau-bench, tau2-Bench, VitaBench) validate effectiveness; In-depth analyses show out-of-domain generalization

Conclusion: Proposed method enables effective RL training in challenging simulated environments with improved stability and generalization

Abstract: Conducting reinforcement learning (RL) in simulated environments offers a cost-effective and highly scalable way to enhance language-based agents. However, previous work has been limited to semi-automated environment synthesis or tasks lacking sufficient difficulty, offering little breadth or depth. In addition, the instability of simulated users integrated into these environments, along with the heterogeneity across simulated environments, poses further challenges for agentic RL. In this work, we propose: (1) a unified pipeline for automated and scalable synthesis of simulated environments associated with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; and (2) an environment level RL algorithm that not only effectively mitigates user instability but also performs advantage estimation at the environment level, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. Comprehensive evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and VitaBench, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further in-depth analyses underscore its out-of-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new pre-training method that adapts RL principles to supervised learning to create better exploration spaces for subsequent RL training of LLMs, finding that precision-oriented priors work better than high-entropy distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL training for LLMs depends heavily on the exploration space defined by pre-trained models' token-output distributions. The standard cross-entropy loss is limited, and there's a need to systematically study how pre-training distributions shape exploration potential for RL to enhance reasoning performance.

Method: The authors reinterpret cross-entropy as policy gradient optimization in single-step episodes, then propose a generalized pre-training objective using on-policy RL principles. They frame next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process with reward shaping that balances diversity and precision using positive reward scaling and rank-aware asymmetric treatment of negative tokens.

Result: Contrary to intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates exploration, the study finds that imposing precision-oriented priors yields superior exploration spaces for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that carefully shaping pre-trained token-output distributions through RL-inspired reward mechanisms can create more favorable exploration spaces for subsequent RL training, with precision-oriented approaches outperforming high-entropy distributions for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.

### [32] [Prompt engineering does not universally improve Large Language Model performance across clinical decision-making tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22966)
*Mengdi Chai,Ali R. Zomorrodi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show variable performance in clinical decision-making tasks, with prompt engineering effects being model- and task-dependent rather than universally beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise in medical knowledge assessments, their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making workflows remains underexplored, particularly across the full clinical reasoning process from diagnosis to treatment.

Method: Evaluated three state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3.3 70B) on 36 case studies across five sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings. Then tested prompt engineering using MedPrompt framework variations with targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning.

Result: Models showed high task variability: near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in diagnostic testing, moderate in other tasks. Temperature effects differed by model. Prompt engineering improved performance only on the weakest baseline task (diagnostic testing) but was counterproductive for others. Targeted few-shot prompting didn't consistently outperform random selection.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering impact is highly model- and task-dependent, not a universal solution. Tailored, context-aware strategies are needed for effective LLM integration into healthcare clinical workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.

*Tao Yu,Yongqi An,Kuan Zhu,Guibo Zhu,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FANG is a post-training pruning framework that groups neurons by function to reduce calibration bias and improve downstream task generalization in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training pruning methods suffer from limited generalization to downstream tasks when few-shot calibration sets don't adequately reflect pretraining data distribution, creating calibration bias.

Method: FANG groups neurons with similar function based on semantic context types, prunes each group independently with weighted importance estimation, preserves cross-context neurons, and adaptively allocates sparsity based on block functional complexity.

Result: FANG achieves SOTA results when combined with FLAP and OBC, outperforming them by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity while preserving language modeling performance.

Conclusion: FANG effectively addresses calibration bias in post-training pruning through function-aware neuron grouping, enabling better downstream task generalization and improved sparsity-performance trade-off.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across natural language tasks but incur substantial computational and storage costs due to their scale. Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.

*Wenxuan Xu,Arvind Pillai,Subigya Nepal,Amanda C Collins,Daniel M Mackin,Michael V Heinz,Tess Z Griffin,Nicholas C Jacobson,Andrew Campbell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LENS is a framework that aligns multimodal health sensing data with language models to generate clinically meaningful mental health narratives from sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs cannot natively process long-duration sensor streams, and there's a scarcity of paired sensor-text datasets for mental health applications, making it challenging to translate numerical time-series measurements into natural language narratives.

Method: 1) Construct large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses into natural-language descriptions (100k+ sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants); 2) Train patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into LLM's representation space for native time-series integration.

Result: LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific symptom-severity accuracy measures. User study with 13 mental-health professionals indicates LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful.

Conclusion: The approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making in mental health.

Abstract: Multimodal health sensing offers rich behavioral signals for assessing mental health, yet translating these numerical time-series measurements into natural language remains challenging. Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.

### [35] [Is Chain-of-Thought Really Not Explainability? Chain-of-Thought Can Be Faithful without Hint Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23032)
*Kerem Zaman,Shashank Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Biasing Features metric for labeling CoTs as unfaithful when they omit prompt-injected hints, arguing this confuses unfaithfulness with necessary incompleteness in natural language narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the validity of the Biasing Features metric for evaluating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness, which labels CoTs as unfaithful when they fail to verbalize prompt-injected hints, potentially mischaracterizing necessary compression as unfaithfulness.

Method: 1) Analyze multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3 models; 2) Compare Biasing Features metric with other faithfulness metrics; 3) Introduce faithful@k metric to study token budget effects; 4) Use Causal Mediation Analysis to examine non-verbalized hint influence.

Result: Many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics (exceeding 50% in some models). Larger token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90%), showing apparent unfaithfulness often stems from token limits. Causal Mediation Analysis reveals non-verbalized hints can still causally mediate predictions through CoTs.

Conclusion: The paper cautions against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocates for a broader interpretability toolkit that includes causal mediation and corruption-based metrics, recognizing that CoT narratives necessarily involve lossy compression of distributed transformer computations.

Abstract: Recent work, using the Biasing Features metric, labels a CoT as unfaithful if it omits a prompt-injected hint that affected the prediction. We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt Choreography: A framework for efficient LLM workflow execution using dynamic global KV cache, enabling message reordering, parallel calls, and fine-tuning to maintain accuracy while achieving 2-6× faster latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows, but current approaches suffer from redundant computation and inefficiency when processing repeated or reordered messages across different workflow steps.

Method: Introduces Prompt Choreography framework with dynamic global KV cache that allows LLM calls to attend to arbitrary, reordered subsets of previously encoded messages. Supports parallel calls and fine-tunes LLMs to work effectively with cached encodings rather than re-encoding.

Result: Achieves 2.0-6.2× faster time-to-first-token latency and >2.2× end-to-end speedups in workflows dominated by redundant computation. Fine-tuning helps LLMs mimic original results despite using cached encodings.

Conclusion: Prompt Choreography significantly improves LLM workflow efficiency through intelligent caching and fine-tuning, enabling faster multi-agent systems while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows. We introduce Prompt Choreography, a framework that efficiently executes LLM workflows by maintaining a dynamic, global KV cache. Each LLM call can attend to an arbitrary, reordered subset of previously encoded messages. Parallel calls are supported. Though caching messages' encodings sometimes gives different results from re-encoding them in a new context, we show in diverse settings that fine-tuning the LLM to work with the cache can help it mimic the original results. Prompt Choreography significantly reduces per-message latency (2.0--6.2$\times$ faster time-to-first-token) and achieves substantial end-to-end speedups ($>$2.2$\times$) in some workflows dominated by redundant computation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TabiBERT is a new monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture, trained from scratch on 1 trillion tokens from a multi-domain corpus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Turkish NLP tasks with improved efficiency and longer context support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch with modern architectural improvements like RoPE, FlashAttention, and refined normalization that have evolved since BERT's inception. Existing Turkish models don't incorporate these efficiency and performance enhancements.

Method: Developed TabiBERT using ModernBERT architecture with Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Trained from scratch on 1 trillion tokens sampled from a curated 84.88B token multi-domain corpus (73% web text, 20% scientific publications, 6% source code, 0.3% mathematical content). Introduced TabiBench with 28 datasets across 8 task categories for standardized evaluation.

Result: TabiBERT achieves 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points. It establishes SOTA on 5 of 8 categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, achieves +1.47 average improvement. Supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT) with 2.65x inference speedup and reduced GPU memory consumption.

Conclusion: TabiBERT represents a significant advancement for Turkish NLP, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization and superior performance over existing Turkish models. The release of model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code enables transparent and reproducible research for the Turkish NLP community.

Abstract: Since the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.

TL;DR: Proposes a MatMul-free language model with reservoir computing layers to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have high computational costs that limit their practical deployment, so the paper aims to improve computational efficiency through architecture modifications.

Method: Uses a MatMul-free language model with partially fixed/shared weights, inserts reservoir computing layers for rich dynamic representations, and combines operations to reduce memory accesses.

Result: Reduces parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0% while maintaining comparable performance to baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully reduces computational costs of LLMs through MatMul-free design and reservoir computing techniques without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing; however, their high computational cost remains a major bottleneck. In this study, we target computational efficiency by focusing on a matrix multiplication free language model (MatMul-free LM) and further reducing the training cost through an architecture inspired by reservoir computing. Specifically, we partially fix and share the weights of selected layers in the MatMul-free LM and insert reservoir layers to obtain rich dynamic representations without additional training overhead. Additionally, several operations are combined to reduce memory accesses. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture reduces the number of parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0%, while maintaining comparable performance to the baseline model.

*Zhuoqi Lyu,Qing Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers created BiomedTLDR, a dataset of human-written scientific summaries, to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate TLDRs. They found LLMs tend to be more extractive (copying original text) than abstractive (paraphrasing) compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of high-quality scientific TLDR datasets to properly develop and evaluate LLMs' summarization capabilities, making it difficult to understand how LLMs perform compared to human experts in generating scientific summaries.

Method: Created BiomedTLDR dataset using researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers (from authors' comments in bibliographies). Tested popular open-weight LLMs by having them generate TLDRs from paper abstracts and compared them to human-written summaries.

Result: While some LLMs produced human-like summaries, they generally showed stronger preference for original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, making them more extractive than abstractive compared to human summarization.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations in generating abstractive scientific summaries like humans do, tending to copy rather than paraphrase. The BiomedTLDR dataset enables better evaluation and development of LLMs' scientific summarization capabilities.

Abstract: High-quality scientific extreme summary (TLDR) facilitates effective science communication. How do large language models (LLMs) perform in generating them? How are LLM-generated summaries different from those written by human experts? However, the lack of a comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR dataset hinders both the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization ability. To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/netknowledge/LLM_summarization (Lyu and Ke, 2025).

Motivation: To leverage the collective wisdom of multiple LLMs with diverse strengths by selecting the most ideal response from multiple candidates, providing an interpretable mechanism while remaining fully unsupervised for flexibility and generalization.

Method: Three-stage peer-review-inspired framework: 1) Scoring using LLM-as-a-Judge technique to evaluate responses, 2) Reasoning using graphical model-based truth inference or averaging to aggregate scores, 3) Selection of highest-scoring response as ensemble output.

Result: Two variants of LLM-PeerReview achieve strong results across four datasets, outperforming the recent advanced model Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3% points respectively.

Conclusion: LLM-PeerReview provides a conceptually simple yet empirically powerful unsupervised ensemble method that effectively harnesses multiple LLMs' collective wisdom through an interpretable peer-review framework.

Abstract: We propose LLM-PeerReview, an unsupervised LLM Ensemble method that selects the most ideal response from multiple LLM-generated candidates for each query, harnessing the collective wisdom of multiple models with diverse strengths. LLM-PeerReview is built on a novel, peer-review-inspired framework that offers a clear and interpretable mechanism, while remaining fully unsupervised for flexible adaptability and generalization. Specifically, it operates in three stages: For scoring, we use the emerging LLM-as-a-Judge technique to evaluate each response by reusing multiple LLMs at hand; For reasoning, we can apply a principled graphical model-based truth inference algorithm or a straightforward averaging strategy to aggregate multiple scores to produce a final score for each response; Finally, the highest-scoring response is selected as the best ensemble output. LLM-PeerReview is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. The two variants of the proposed approach obtain strong results across four datasets, including outperforming the recent advanced model Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3% points, respectively.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs show systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks, which researchers hypothesize stems from the flexibility of general-purpose languages that allow multiple valid approaches and require implicit state management.

Method: Introduce Anka, a domain-specific language for data transformation pipelines with explicit, constrained syntax to reduce ambiguity in code generation. Test LLMs (Claude 3.5 Haiku and GPT-4o-mini) on 100 benchmark problems despite zero prior training exposure to Anka.

Result: Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy. Anka shows 40 percentage point advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%). Cross-validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms +26.7 percentage point advantage on multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and purposefully designed DSLs can outperform general-purpose languages for LLM generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.

### [42] [Interpretable Safety Alignment via SAE-Constructed Low-Rank Subspace Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23260)
*Dianyun Wang,Qingsen Ma,Yuhu Shang,Zhifeng Lu,Lechen Ning,Zhenbo Xu,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAE-guided LoRA initialization uses sparse autoencoders to identify task-relevant features in disentangled space, creating interpretable low-rank subspaces for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that outperforms full fine-tuning on safety alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA operate as black boxes, learning task-relevant subspaces implicitly without interpretability or direct control, which limits transparency and potentially performance.

Method: Leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct explicit, interpretable low-rank subspaces to guide adapter initialization, addressing polysemanticity issues in standard approaches.

Result: Achieves up to 99.6% safety rate on safety alignment tasks, exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters, and approaches RLHF-based methods in performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating mechanistic interpretability into fine-tuning can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency, demonstrating that explicit feature identification through SAEs enables more effective and interpretable parameter-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become the dominant paradigm for adapting large language models to downstream tasks. Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LiveAMR, a new task for detecting pronunciation-based morph evasion in Chinese e-commerce live streams, particularly in health/medical domains, and presents a dataset and text-to-text generation method using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce live streaming hosts in China use pronunciation-based morphs to evade scrutiny and engage in false advertising, especially in health/medical domains, creating a need for automated detection methods.

Method: Transformed the morph resolution task into a text-to-text generation problem, constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples, and leveraged large language models to generate additional training data for improved performance.

Result: Developed a method that significantly improves performance in detecting morph evasion, demonstrating that morph resolution enhances live streaming regulation effectiveness.

Conclusion: The LiveAMR task addresses a critical gap in live streaming regulation by targeting pronunciation-based evasion, and the proposed approach effectively detects morph violations that enable false advertising in e-commerce live streams.

Abstract: E-commerce live streaming in China, particularly on platforms like Douyin, has become a major sales channel, but hosts often use morphs to evade scrutiny and engage in false advertising. This study introduces the Live Auditory Morph Resolution (LiveAMR) task to detect such violations. Unlike previous morph research focused on text-based evasion in social media and underground industries, LiveAMR targets pronunciation-based evasion in health and medical live streams. We constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples and developed a method to transform the task into a text-to-text generation problem. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data, we improved performance and demonstrated that morph resolution significantly enhances live streaming regulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI4Reading is a multi-agent LLM system that automates audiobook interpretation generation, improving accessibility while reducing manual creation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of audiobook interpretations is time-consuming and resource-intensive, despite their value in providing accessible book analyses. There's a need to automate this process while maintaining quality.

Method: Multi-agent collaboration system with 11 specialized agents (topic analysts, case analysts, editors, narrator, proofreaders) using LLMs and speech synthesis. Framework focuses on content preservation, comprehensibility, and logical narrative structure.

Result: Comparison with expert interpretations shows AI4Reading generates simpler and more accurate interpretative scripts, though speech generation quality still lags behind human performance.

Conclusion: AI4Reading demonstrates promising automation of audiobook interpretation creation with improved script accuracy and simplicity, though speech synthesis quality needs further improvement to match human narration.

Abstract: Audiobook interpretations are attracting increasing attention, as they provide accessible and in-depth analyses of books that offer readers practical insights and intellectual inspiration. However, their manual creation process remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AI4Reading, a multi-agent collaboration system leveraging large language models (LLMs) and speech synthesis technology to generate podcast, like audiobook interpretations. The system is designed to meet three key objectives: accurate content preservation, enhanced comprehensibility, and a logical narrative structure. To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language. By comparing expert interpretations with our system's output, the results show that although AI4Reading still has a gap in speech generation quality, the generated interpretative scripts are simpler and more accurate.

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive interdisciplinary review connecting cognitive neuroscience memory mechanisms with LLM-driven autonomous agents, covering definitions, taxonomy, storage, management, evaluation benchmarks, security, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the interdisciplinary gap between cognitive neuroscience and AI by systematically synthesizing knowledge about memory mechanisms, as existing autonomous agent research struggles to assimilate the essence of human memory due to disciplinary barriers.

Method: The paper systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge by: 1) elucidating memory definition and function across cognitive neuroscience, LLMs, and agents; 2) providing comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and management lifecycle from biological and artificial perspectives; 3) reviewing mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory; 4) exploring memory security from attack and defense perspectives.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive framework connecting cognitive neuroscience insights with LLM-driven agents, establishing comparative analyses across disciplines, reviewing evaluation benchmarks, and analyzing security considerations - providing a foundational synthesis for future research.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by envisioning future research directions focused on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition, emphasizing the need for continued interdisciplinary integration to advance autonomous agent memory capabilities.

Abstract: Memory serves as the pivotal nexus bridging past and future, providing both humans and AI systems with invaluable concepts and experience to navigate complex tasks. Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with a focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.

*Xin Zhang,Yang Cao,Baoxing Wu,Xinyi Chen,Kai Song,Siying Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGR: A stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs that uses external subgraph generation to improve logical inference by reducing noise and guiding structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning and logical inference, often incorporating noisy or irrelevant information from training data that leads to incorrect predictions or factual inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes SGR framework that: 1) dynamically constructs query-relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases, 2) guides step-by-step reasoning over structured subgraphs, and 3) integrates multiple reasoning paths for final answer generation.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SGR effectively addresses LLM reasoning limitations by leveraging external knowledge subgraphs to reduce noise and improve logical inference through structured, stepwise reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks in recent years, including machine translation, text generation, and question answering. As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

### [47] [Entropy-Guided Token Dropout: Training Autoregressive Language Models with Limited Domain Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23422)
*Jiapeng Wang,Yiwen Hu,Yanzipeng Gao,Haoyu Wang,Shuo Wang,Hongyu Lu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Junyi Li,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EntroDrop: An entropy-guided token dropout method that prevents performance degradation in multi-epoch LLM training by selectively masking low-entropy tokens and using curriculum scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-epoch training is necessary for adapting LLMs to data-constrained domains, but autoregressive models suffer performance degradation from overfitting when repeatedly exposed to the same data. This degradation stems from an imbalance where predictable low-entropy tokens dominate optimization while generalization on high-entropy tokens deteriorates.

Method: EntroDrop is an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. It selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength based on training progress.

Result: Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. EntroDrop offers a promising pathway for more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.

Abstract: As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.

### [48] [The Effect of Gender Diversity on Scientific Team Impact: A Team Roles Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23429)
*Yi Zhao,Yongjun Zhu,Donghun Kim,Yuzhuo Wang,Heng Zhang,Chao Lu,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gender diversity in scientific teams has complex effects on impact: inverted U-shaped relationship for both leadership and support roles, with all-female leadership + all-male support teams performing best, and team size moderates leadership diversity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research on gender diversity and team success shows inconsistent findings and typically uses aggregate diversity measures, overlooking internal role differentiation. There's limited understanding of how gender diversity across different team roles affects scientific impact.

Method: Analyzed 130,000+ PLOS papers (mostly biomedical). Defined teams as all coauthors, measured impact via 5-year citations. Used author contribution statements to classify members into leadership vs. support roles. Applied multivariable regression to examine gender diversity- impact relationship, and threshold regression to test team size moderation.

Result: 1) Gender diversity shows inverted U-shaped relationship with impact for both leadership and support groups. 2) Teams with all-female leadership + all-male support achieve highest impact. 3) Leadership diversity effect is negative for small teams but becomes positive/insignificant for large teams, while support-group diversity remains significantly positive regardless of team size.

Conclusion: Gender diversity effects on team impact are nuanced and role-dependent. Role differentiation matters - leadership and support roles show different diversity patterns. Team size moderates leadership diversity effects but not support diversity effects. Optimal team composition involves gender-homogeneous groups in complementary roles.

Abstract: The influence of gender diversity on the success of scientific teams is of great interest to academia. However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.

*Xuan Feng,Bo An,Tianlong Gu,Liang Chang,Fengrui Hao,Peipeng Yu,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C2PO is a unified alignment framework that simultaneously addresses stereotypical and structural biases in LLMs by discovering and suppressing spurious feature correlations through causal counterfactual signals and fairness-sensitive preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to bias mitigation in LLMs typically address stereotypical biases (gender/racial stereotypes) and structural biases (lexical overlap/position preferences) in isolation, often improving one while worsening the other. There's a need for a unified framework that tackles both types of reasoning failures simultaneously.

Method: Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO) uses causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features directly within the optimization process.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show C2PO effectively mitigates both stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover) and structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), while preserving general reasoning capabilities on tasks like MMLU and GSM8K, and maintaining fairness on out-of-domain datasets (StereoSet, WinoBias).

Conclusion: C2PO provides a unified solution to address both stereotypical and structural biases in LLMs by targeting the root cause - spurious feature correlations - through causal reasoning and preference optimization, offering balanced bias mitigation without sacrificing general utility.

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses significant risks to trustworthiness, manifesting primarily as stereotypical biases (e.g., gender or racial stereotypes) and structural biases (e.g., lexical overlap or position preferences). However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities.

*Yuqi Tang,Jing Yu,Zichang Su,Kehua Feng,Zhihui Zhu,Libin Wang,Lei Liang,Qiang Zhang,Keyan Ding,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClinDEF is a dynamic framework for evaluating LLMs' clinical reasoning through simulated diagnostic dialogues, going beyond static QA to assess diagnostic quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks fail to capture the dynamic, iterative nature of clinical reasoning in doctor-patient interactions, focusing instead on static question-answering. Current dynamic medical frameworks rely on limited datasets prone to contamination and lack granular, multi-level evaluation.

Method: ClinDEF uses a disease knowledge graph to dynamically generate patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. It incorporates fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality.

Result: Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, providing a more nuanced evaluation of their diagnostic capabilities.

Conclusion: ClinDEF offers a more clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm for assessing LLMs' clinical reasoning abilities through dynamic diagnostic dialogues, addressing limitations of existing static benchmarks.

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis begins with doctor-patient interaction, during which physicians iteratively gather information, determine examination and refine differential diagnosis through patients' response. This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.

*Ang Lv,Jin Ma,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ERC loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that couples router decisions with expert capabilities in MoE models to improve performance through specialization constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models lack explicit constraints to ensure router decisions align with expert capabilities, limiting model performance. Need for better coupling between routing decisions and what experts can actually process.

Method: Treats each expert's router embedding as proxy token, feeds perturbed embeddings through experts, and enforces two constraints: (1) each expert shows higher activation for its own proxy token than others, (2) each proxy token elicits stronger activation from its corresponding expert than others. Computationally efficient (n^2 activations).

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through pre-training MoE-LLMs from 3B to 15B parameters on trillions of tokens. Provides flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization during training.

Conclusion: ERC loss effectively couples router decisions with expert capabilities, improves MoE performance, offers computational efficiency, and provides valuable insights into MoE specialization dynamics.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.

*Thomas Haschka,Joseph Bakarji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes nested density clustering on LLM embeddings to build hierarchical semantic trees from text corpora, enabling data-driven discovery of research areas and subfields without predefined categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM embeddings are used for semantic similarity search, the global hierarchical semantic structure in text corpora often remains opaque. There's a need to automatically discover and visualize hierarchical semantic relationships without predefined categories.

Method: Uses nested density clustering on LLM embeddings: starts with dense clusters of strong semantic similarity, gradually relaxes density criterion to merge clusters into more diffuse ones, building a hierarchical tree structure where dense clusters embed into increasingly diffuse clusters until reaching a single root cluster.

Result: Successfully applied to scientific abstracts for research area discovery, and validated on benchmark datasets (20 Newsgroups, IMDB 50k Movie Reviews), demonstrating robustness across domains and enabling data-driven discovery of semantic hierarchies.

Conclusion: Nested density trees effectively reveal hierarchical semantic structure in text corpora, with applications in scientometrics, topic evolution analysis, and semantic structure visualization across various domains.

Abstract: Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACT is a three-stage algorithm for detecting biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature that outperforms existing systems with F1 score of 0.91 by combining morphology-aware alignment with context-sensitive enrichment to handle short, paraphrased, and structurally embedded quotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text reuse frameworks struggle with detecting biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature due to challenges with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations. There's a methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment in digital humanities and computational philology.

Method: ACT is a three-stage algorithm that combines morphology-aware alignment with context-sensitive enrichment to identify complex citation patterns like "Wave" and "Echo" quotations. It uses three configurations: full pipeline (ACT-QE), ACT-2 without stylistic enrichment, and ACT-3 using longer n-grams.

Result: ACT-QE outperforms all baselines (Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher) with F1 score of 0.91, Recall of 0.89, and Precision of 0.94. ACT-2 achieves higher Recall (0.90) but lower Precision, while ACT-3 offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.

Conclusion: ACT addresses methodological gaps in digital humanities by improving quotation detection and enabling stylistic pattern classification across corpora. It lays foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially for morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.

Abstract: This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as "Wave" and "Echo" quotations.
  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.
  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether visual generation tasks can enhance visual understanding in unified vision-language models at large data scales (>200M samples).

Method: UniHetero model with concise structure, using large-scale pretraining and analyzing the relationship between generation and understanding tasks.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Generation improves understanding only when generating semantics (not pixels), 2) Generation shows superior data scaling trends and higher data utilization, 3) Autoregression on input embedding effectively captures visual details.

Conclusion: Visual generation can enhance visual understanding in unified models when focused on semantic generation rather than pixel-level generation, demonstrating better data efficiency and scaling properties.

Abstract: Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified model with a concise structure, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization.

### [55] [Single LLM Debate, MoLaCE: Mixture of Latent Concept Experts Against Confirmation Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23518)
*Hazel Kim,Philip Torr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLaCE is a lightweight inference-time framework that reduces LLM confirmation bias by mixing experts as different activation strengths over latent concepts, enabling single models to emulate debate benefits internally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from input confirmation bias where they reinforce preferred answers in prompts rather than exploring alternatives. This is especially problematic in multi-agent debates where echo chambers amplify rather than correct bias.

Method: MoLaCE (Mixture of Latent Concept Experts) uses a lightweight inference-time framework that mixes experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts shaping model responses. It leverages the insight that differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways affecting factual correctness.

Result: MoLaCE consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate performance while requiring only a fraction of the computation. It can also be integrated into multi-agent frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors.

Conclusion: MoLaCE provides an efficient, scalable solution to LLM confirmation bias by enabling single models to internally emulate debate benefits through latent concept activation mixing, outperforming computationally expensive multi-agent approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.

*Sahil Kale,Antonio Luca Alfeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using knowledge graphs to structure LLM responses improves hallucination self-detection by 16% accuracy and 20% F1-score compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs remain a major barrier to safe deployment, and while self-detection methods show promise, they need improvement for more reliable detection of false statements.

Method: Proposes converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, then using these structured representations to estimate hallucination likelihood. Evaluated on GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash across two hallucination datasets.

Result: Achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score compared to standard self-detection methods and state-of-the-art SelfCheckGPT. Also releases an enhanced, manually curated dataset for benchmarking.

Conclusion: LLMs can better analyze atomic facts when structured as knowledge graphs, even with initial inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach advances safer and more trustworthy language models.

Abstract: Hallucinations, the generation of apparently convincing yet false statements, remain a major barrier to the safe deployment of LLMs. Building on the strong performance of self-detection methods, we examine the use of structured knowledge representations, namely knowledge graphs, to improve hallucination self-detection. Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models.

### [57] [Instruction-Following Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23572)
*Daiki Shiono,Shumpei Miyawaki,Ryota Tanaka,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs lose LLMs' instruction-following ability after visual instruction tuning; including explicit output format instructions in training helps mitigate this decline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) integrated from LLMs often fail to maintain the strong instruction-following ability of the original LLMs after visual instruction tuning, leading to poor task execution.

Method: Constructed new training datasets highlighting whether output format is specified, then investigated how explicitly indicating output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability through quantitative evaluation.

Result: Quantitative evaluation confirmed LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Models trained with datasets including explicit output format instructions follow instructions more accurately.

Conclusion: Including samples with instructions on output format during visual instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities in LVLMs.

Abstract: Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.

### [58] [Style Amnesia: Investigating Speaking Style Degradation and Mitigation in Multi-Turn Spoken Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23578)
*Yu-Xiang Lin,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs suffer from "style amnesia" - they can't maintain instructed speaking styles (emotion, accent, volume, speed) across multi-turn conversations, despite being able to recall the instructions when asked.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether spoken language models can consistently maintain paralinguistic speaking styles (emotion, accent, volume, speaking speed) throughout multi-turn conversations when instructed to do so, and to understand the limitations of current SLMs in style persistence.

Method: Evaluated three proprietary and two open-source SLMs by instructing them to speak in specific styles at the beginning of conversations and tracking style maintenance across multiple turns. Tested various prompting strategies including system vs user messages, and examined whether explicit recall requests could mitigate style forgetting.

Result: All tested SLMs failed to maintain consistent speaking styles across conversations despite initial instructions. Models could recall style instructions when explicitly asked but failed to express them. Explicit recall requests partially mitigated style amnesia. Surprisingly, SLMs struggled more with system messages than user messages for style instructions.

Conclusion: Current SLMs suffer from "style amnesia" - a fundamental limitation in maintaining paralinguistic speaking styles across multi-turn conversations. This reveals a gap between instruction recall and style expression, and suggests system prompts may not function as intended for style maintenance in current SLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfTool is a fully autonomous framework that enables LLMs to reliably invoke external tools through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art performance on function-calling benchmarks without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for enabling LLMs to invoke external tools suffer from three critical issues: expensive human annotation requirements, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings due to single-model synthesis that perpetuates biases and coverage gaps.

Method: InfTool uses a multi-agent system with three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) that generate diverse, verified trajectories from raw API specifications. It establishes a closed-loop cycle where synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, and the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, iterating without human intervention.

Result: On the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258% improvement), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.

Conclusion: InfTool demonstrates that fully autonomous, self-evolving multi-agent synthesis can overcome fundamental limitations in tool-calling for LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance while eliminating the need for expensive human annotation and addressing generalization and bias issues.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to reliably invoke external tools remains a critical bottleneck for autonomous agents. Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.

TL;DR: Introduces CHQ-Sum, a new dataset of 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and summaries to address the lack of specialized resources for healthcare question summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer health questions on the web are often overly descriptive and contain peripheral information, making natural language understanding challenging. There's a lack of domain-expert annotated datasets for healthcare question summarization, inhibiting development of efficient summarization systems.

Method: Created CHQ-Sum dataset containing 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from community question answering forums, providing real-world examples of consumer health-related posts on social media.

Result: The paper introduces a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. The dataset is benchmarked on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to demonstrate its effectiveness and utility for the research community.

Conclusion: CHQ-Sum addresses the critical gap in domain-specific resources for consumer healthcare question summarization, enabling development of more efficient summarization systems and advancing research in healthcare natural language processing.

Abstract: The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers health-related questions. Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset

TL;DR: NestBrowse introduces a nested browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration, enabling information-seeking agents to perform real browsing beyond API-level retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current information-seeking agents are limited to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, restricting access to richer information available through real browsing. Full browser interaction offers deeper capabilities but introduces complexity for ReAct-style agents due to fine-grained control and verbose page content.

Method: NestBrowse proposes a minimal and complete browser-action framework with a nested structure that decouples interaction control from page exploration. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition.

Result: Empirical results on challenging deep information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear practical benefits. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: NestBrowse successfully bridges the gap between limited API-level retrieval and complex full browser interaction, providing a framework that enables information-seeking agents to effectively access deeper web information through simplified browser interaction.

Abstract: Information-seeking (IS) agents have achieved strong performance across a range of wide and deep search tasks, yet their tool use remains largely restricted to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, limiting access to the richer information available through real browsing. While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

TL;DR: The paper examines how much context is needed when studying relationships between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena, finding that n-gram representations are sufficient for observing probabilistic reduction effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the appropriate amount of context required when investigating connections between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena, particularly whether whole utterances are necessary or if simpler representations suffice.

Method: The researchers investigate whether n-gram representations can serve as cognitive units of planning by testing if they are sufficient to observe probabilistic reduction effects, comparing them against whole utterance representations.

Result: The study demonstrates that n-gram representations suffice as cognitive units of planning and are sufficient to observe probabilistic reduction, suggesting that whole utterances are not necessary for these investigations.

Conclusion: Simpler n-gram representations are adequate for studying relationships between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena like probabilistic reduction, providing a more efficient approach than using whole utterances.

Abstract: The primary research questions of this paper center on defining the amount of context that is necessary and/or appropriate when investigating the relationship between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena. We investigate whether whole utterances are necessary to observe probabilistic reduction and demonstrate that n-gram representations suffice as cognitive units of planning.

*Panagiotis Theocharopoulos,Ajinkya Kulkarni,Mathew Magimai. -Doss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based academic peer review systems are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks, with varying susceptibility across different languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact workflows like academic peer review, there's a need to understand their vulnerability to hidden adversarial attacks embedded within documents.

Method: Created dataset of ~500 real ICML papers, injected each with semantically equivalent instructions in four languages (English, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic), then reviewed using an LLM to measure effects on scores and decisions.

Result: Prompt injection caused substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, but little to no effect for Arabic injections.

Conclusion: LLM-based reviewing systems are susceptible to document-level prompt injection, with significant language-dependent vulnerabilities that need to be addressed for secure deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered for use in high-impact workflows, including academic peer review. However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages.

TL;DR: ProfASR-Bench is a professional ASR evaluation suite that reveals current promptable systems underutilize contextual information despite having the capability, showing minimal WER improvement even with oracle prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR benchmarks underplay challenges in professional settings: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. There's a need for evaluation that measures context-conditioned recognition in high-stakes applications.

Method: Created ProfASR-Bench with natural-language prompts (domain cues/speaker profiles) paired with entity-rich target utterances. Evaluated Whisper and Qwen-Omni models under five conditions: no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial prompts. Used entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent/gender.

Result: Found consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average WER, even with oracle prompts. Adversarial prompts don't reliably degrade performance. Identified "context-utilization gap" - systems are promptable but underuse available side information.

Conclusion: ProfASR-Bench provides standardized context ladder, entity/slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies. Highlights need for better context utilization in professional ASR systems.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

*Sky CH-Wang,Justin Svegliato,Helen Appel,Jason Eisner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning language models using feedback-driven improvement chains where annotators mark liked/disliked spans, then the model incrementally rewrites disliked spans from left to right, creating preference pairs for more effective alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve preference tuning of language models by moving beyond standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, seeking more structured and targeted supervision that focuses on localized edits rather than complete response comparisons.

Method: Annotators provide fine-grained feedback by marking specific "liked" and "disliked" spans in model responses and explaining what they liked/disliked. The base model then incrementally rewrites disliked spans from left to right, creating a chain of improvements. Preference pairs are constructed from adjacent steps in this chain for direct alignment training.

Result: The approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

Conclusion: Feedback-driven improvement chains with localized, targeted edits provide superior preference supervision compared to traditional methods, enabling language models to learn more effectively from structured revision-based feedback.

Abstract: We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains. Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

*Jing Huang,Shujian Zhang,Lun Wang,Andrew Hard,Rajiv Mathews,John Lambert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Online behavior elicitation methods achieve 45-77% success rates in multi-turn conversations with few thousand queries, outperforming static methods that find few failure cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior elicitation techniques for LLMs are mainly studied in single-turn settings, but real-world conversational AI operates in multi-turn contexts. There's a need to evaluate LLMs in dynamic, multi-turn conversations where complex behaviors emerge over time.

Method: 1) Proposed analytical framework categorizing methods into three families: prior knowledge-based, offline interaction-based, and online interaction-based. 2) Introduced generalized multi-turn formulation of online methods unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. 3) Evaluated all three method families on automatically generating multi-turn test cases, analyzing trade-off between query budget and success rate.

Result: Online methods achieved average success rates of 45%, 19%, and 77% across three tasks with just a few thousand queries. Static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks found few or even no failure cases, demonstrating the superiority of dynamic online approaches.

Conclusion: Behavior elicitation methods are valuable for multi-turn conversation evaluation, and the community should move towards dynamic benchmarks rather than relying on static test cases. Online interaction-based methods are particularly effective for discovering failure cases in conversational LLMs.

Abstract: Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.

*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper systematically analyzes how motion is encoded across timesteps in text-to-video diffusion models, identifying distinct motion-dominant and appearance-dominant regimes, and uses this understanding to simplify motion customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While practitioners use heuristics that early timesteps shape motion/layout and later ones refine appearance, this behavior hasn't been systematically characterized. Understanding motion encoding across timesteps is crucial for better video generation and editing.

Method: Proxies motion encoding by analyzing the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation when injecting new conditions over specific timestep ranges. Conducts large-scale quantitative study to factor motion from appearance along the denoising trajectory.

Result: Consistently identifies early motion-dominant regime and later appearance-dominant regime across diverse architectures, establishing an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space.

Conclusion: Turns heuristic into spatiotemporal disentanglement principle. Simplifies motion customization by restricting training/inference to motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without complex debiasing modules. Provides ready integration for existing motion transfer/editing methods.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA is a modular framework that separates perception from reasoning in vision-language models to reduce reliance on spurious correlations, using a frozen VLM for objective perception queries and a text-only LLM for reasoning, trained with reinforcement learning on minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end VLMs often exploit spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence when answering questions, and this problem worsens with fine-tuning. Current models lack robustness to real-world biases and shortcut learning.

Method: VISTA decouples perception from reasoning using an information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor provides short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes questions, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. The framework is trained with reinforcement learning (GRPO) using only 641 curated multi-step questions.

Result: VISTA significantly improves robustness to spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), remains competitive on MMVP and SeedBench, transfers across unseen VLM sensors, and can recognize/recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis shows more neutral, less biased reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The modular approach of separating perception from reasoning with an information bottleneck effectively reduces shortcut learning in VLMs, enabling more robust visual reasoning with minimal training data while maintaining transferability across different vision models.

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

### [71] [SAMM2D: Scale-Aware Multi-Modal 2D Dual-Encoder for High-Sensitivity Intracrania Aneurysm Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22185)
*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMM2D achieves 32% improvement over clinical baseline for aneurysm detection, but surprisingly finds that data augmentation degrades performance when using strong pretrained backbones, challenging conventional wisdom in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aneurysm detection is challenging due to subtle morphology, class imbalance, and scarce annotated data. Current methods struggle with these limitations, and there's a need for more effective detection to prevent life-threatening hemorrhages.

Method: SAMM2D is a dual-encoder framework tested on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset. The study conducted comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes and compared performance with and without data augmentation using strong pretrained backbones.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.686 (32% improvement over clinical baseline). Unaugmented baseline outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75-2.23 percentage points (p<0.01). With threshold calibration, reached 95% sensitivity surpassing average radiologist performance. Grad-CAM showed 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions.

Conclusion: Strong pretrained features already capture robust invariances, making additional augmentations redundant and disruptive. Future medical imaging workflows may benefit more from strong pretraining than complex augmentation pipelines. The model demonstrates clinical utility with projected $13.9M savings per 1,000 patients.

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HookMIL is a context-aware Multiple Instance Learning framework for computational pathology that uses learnable hook tokens for efficient contextual aggregation with linear complexity, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIL approaches lose crucial contextual information in whole-slide images, while transformer-based variants suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. There's a need for a more efficient and context-aware MIL framework.

Method: Proposes HookMIL with learnable hook tokens that can be initialized from three sources: key-patch visual features, text embeddings from vision-language models, and spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. Uses bidirectional attention with linear complexity, Hook Diversity Loss to encourage specialization, and hook-to-hook communication to refine contextual interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: HookMIL provides an effective solution for weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images by combining multimodal initialization, linear computational complexity, and specialized contextual aggregation mechanisms.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

### [73] [Tiny-YOLOSAM: Fast Hybrid Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22193)
*Kenneth Xu,Songhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tiny-YOLOSAM: A fast hybrid pipeline combining YOLOv12 detection with TinySAM segmentation, using box prompts for salient objects and sparse point prompts for uncovered regions, achieving 4.7x speedup over dense "segment-everything" prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM and its lightweight variant TinySAM are computationally expensive for latency-critical applications, especially in "segment-everything" mode which requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice.

Method: Proposes Tiny-YOLOSAM: 1) Uses YOLOv12 detector to generate box prompts for salient foreground objects, 2) Supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage, creating a hybrid prompting strategy.

Result: On COCO val2017: Class-agnostic coverage improves dramatically (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x speedup) on Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Conclusion: Detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling is an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation, offering significant speed improvements while maintaining good coverage.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

*Shivum Telang*

TL;DR: A multimodal explainability model using VLM with few-shot learning generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps across OCT and fundus images to explain DR severity classification through lesion distribution analysis in retinal quadrants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for DR detection lack practical interpretability for clinicians - they either require impractical manual lesion annotation or provide limited explanations through single imaging modalities. Physicians need models that explain classification reasoning rather than just highlighting lesion locations.

Method: A novel multimodal explainability model using Vision-Language Model (VLM) with few-shot learning that mimics ophthalmologist reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps showing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images.

Result: The model was developed using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, creating a comprehensive tool that visually highlights regions contributing to DR severity classification through multimodal analysis.

Conclusion: This innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics by providing practical multimodal explainability, offering a comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes in screening, treatment, and research settings.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

*Qiang Guo,Rubo Zhang,Bingbing Zhang,Junjie Liu,Jianqing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCFormer is a tiny, ultra-lightweight (5M params) weakly-supervised transformer for crowd counting that achieves competitive performance using only image-level counts, making it suitable for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crowd counting requires labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally heavy backbones, limiting scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses efficient vision transformer as feature extractor, Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module to re-weight local tokens based on predicted density, and density-level classification loss to discretize crowd density into grades.

Result: Achieves superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy on ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets, demonstrating competitive performance with only 5M parameters.

Conclusion: TCFormer provides an effective solution for edge device deployment by combining weak supervision, parameter efficiency, and transformer-based architecture for crowd counting tasks.

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional malaria diagnosis via microscopic blood smear analysis has low sensitivity, requires expert judgment, and lacks resources in remote settings, necessitating automated, accurate alternatives.

Method: Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic classification of blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected, compared against established architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) with Explainable AI techniques (SHAP, LIME, Saliency Maps).

Result: Model achieves 96% accuracy with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods and providing interpretable results.

Conclusion: Deep learning offers quick, accurate, and understandable malaria diagnosis suitable for resource-limited areas, with the custom CNN showing promising results and explainable AI enhancing clinical trust.

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Signal-SGN++: A topology-aware spiking graph framework for energy-efficient action recognition that combines structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics to outperform SNN methods and compete with GCNs while reducing energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs are effective for skeletal action recognition but energy-intensive due to dense floating-point computations. SNNs offer energy efficiency through event-driven sparse activation but struggle to capture coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. There's a need to bridge this gap for energy-efficient yet accurate action recognition.

Method: Proposes Signal-SGN++ with: 1) 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) backbone for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction; 2) Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism for adaptive attention routing across learned skeletal topologies; 3) Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch with Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs while substantially reducing energy consumption on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: Signal-SGN++ successfully bridges the gap between GCNs and SNNs by combining structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics, offering an energy-efficient yet accurate solution for skeletal action recognition that maintains topological awareness while leveraging spiking neural network efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

We introduce VLM-PAR, a modular vision-language framework built on frozen SigLIP 2 multilingual encoders. By first aligning image and prompt embeddings via refining visual features through a compact cross-attention fusion, VLM-PAR achieves significant accuracy improvement on the highly imbalanced PA100K benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance, while also delivering significant gains in mean accuracy across PETA and Market-1501 benchmarks. These results underscore the efficacy of integrating large-scale vision-language pretraining with targeted cross-modal refinement to overcome imbalance and generalization challenges in PAR.

*Tasha Pais,Nikhilesh Belulkar*

TL;DR: Semantic Abstraction uses 2D VLM relevancy maps as "abstract object" representations to learn 3D localization and completion for hidden objects, enabling efficient search using historical placement data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable household robots to efficiently find lost or hidden objects by developing a framework that can localize occluded objects that cannot be directly identified by vision-language models.

Method: Treats 2D VLM relevancy activations as "abstract object" representations, uses this framework to learn 3D localization and completion for hidden objects, and incorporates historical placement data to optimize unstructured search.

Result: The model can accurately identify complete 3D locations of hidden objects on the first try significantly faster than naive random search approaches.

Conclusion: Semantic Abstraction extensions provide household robots with time-saving skills for finding lost objects by efficiently localizing hidden objects using abstract representations and historical data.

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

*Naishan Zheng,Jie Huang,Qingpei Guo,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoScaffold is a dynamic representation framework for streaming video understanding that adaptively adjusts event granularity and preserves visual semantics through elastic-scale segmentation and hierarchical consolidation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static video understanding strategies (sparse sampling, frame compression, clustering) are optimized for offline settings and produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams, failing to handle temporal coherence and redundancy effectively.

Method: VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES) for prediction-guided dynamic refinement of event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC) for progressive aggregation of semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions.

Result: Extensive experiments across offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension.

Conclusion: VideoScaffold enables smooth transition from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as video streams unfold, addressing challenges of redundancy and temporal coherence in long video understanding with MLLMs.

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

*HaoNan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAN-FPN-Stem, a novel front-end architecture that replaces the standard linear smoothing convolution in FPN with a KAN-based convolutional layer to address performance bottlenecks in ViT-based pose estimation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformers (ViT) for dense prediction tasks like pose estimation suffer from overly simplistic front-end designs. The naive patchification mechanism in models like ViTPose struggles with multi-scale variations and causes irreversible information loss during initial feature extraction.

Method: The authors retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of FPN but replace the terminal linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a KAN-based convolutional layer. This leverages KAN's superior non-linear modeling capabilities to adaptively learn and rectify artifacts generated during multi-scale fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on COCO dataset show that KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline.

Conclusion: The work reveals that the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention) but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion), and provides an effective solution through KAN operators. It delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module for ViT-based pose estimation.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Xiaoling Xu,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiG-DM is a meta-information guided cross-domain diffusion model that integrates patient-specific clinical parameters and projection-domain physics to enhance low-dose PET image quality while preserving physiological details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose PET imaging reduces radiation exposure but suffers from noise, reduced contrast, and difficulty preserving physiological details. Existing methods neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information crucial for functional-semantic correlation mining.

Method: MiG-DM integrates meta-information encoding (transforming clinical parameters into semantic prompts) with cross-domain architecture combining projection-domain and image-domain processing. A sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering.

Result: Experiments on UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model effectively addresses low-dose PET imaging challenges by integrating comprehensive cross-modal priors, showing superior performance in generating high-quality PET images.

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

TL;DR: Proposes hybrid knowledge distillation framework for lightweight CNN in smart agriculture, achieving near-teacher accuracy with 10x smaller model size and 2.7x lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices in smart agriculture, balancing computational efficiency with recognition accuracy.

Method: Hybrid knowledge distillation framework with customized student model combining inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity, trained under ResNet18 teacher guidance using multi-objective strategy integrating hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation.

Result: Student model achieves 98.56% accuracy on rice seed variety classification (vs teacher's 98.65%) with only 0.68 GFLOPs and ~1.07M parameters (2.7x lower computation, 10x smaller than ResNet18). Outperforms DenseNet121 (6x fewer parameters) and ViT (80x fewer parameters) while maintaining comparable/superior accuracy. Consistent gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems through effective knowledge distillation that maintains high accuracy while dramatically reducing model size and computational requirements.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a major challenge in smart agriculture due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

TL;DR: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion framework improves object detection for autonomous robots in varying light conditions by dynamically selecting optimal fusion ratios and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB detection struggles in low-light, while thermal systems lack color/texture info. Need robust vision for emergency service robots in diverse illumination conditions.

Method: Trained 33 YOLO models on 22k+ annotated images across three light levels. Fused RGB and LWIR streams at 11 blending ratios (100/0 to 0/100 in 10% increments). Dynamic model selection based on illumination.

Result: Best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR): 92.8% mean confidence. Best dim-light model (90/10): 92.0%. Both significantly outperformed YOLOv5n and YOLOv11n baselines. No-light model (40/60): 71.0% (exceeded baselines but not statistically significant).

Conclusion: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improves detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance for emergency applications.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher to guide text-to-image diffusion models toward better geometric understanding without specialized training, enabling separation of geometry and style for improved semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models generate detailed textures but often fail to follow strict geometric constraints, especially when constraints conflict with text prompt style. There's a semantic gap between human perception and generative models regarding geometric understanding.

Method: Proposes using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. A Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on THINGS triplet dataset captures human sensitivity to object shape. Gradients from this teacher are injected into latent diffusion process to separate geometry and style controllably. Evaluated across Stable Diffusion v1.5, SiT-XL/2 flow-matching model, and PixArt-Σ diffusion transformer.

Result: Shows that flow models tend to drift back toward default trajectories without continuous guidance. Demonstrates zero-shot transfer of complex 3D shapes (like Eames chair) onto conflicting materials (pink metal). Guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80% compared to unguided baselines.

Conclusion: Small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis. Geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner using external guidance signals.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

TL;DR: Current AI models perform well on structured medical questions but struggle with open-ended multimodal clinical reasoning, showing limitations in image interpretation and integration with contradictory evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks based on medical exams or curated vignettes fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning needed for real-world patient care, necessitating more comprehensive evaluation of foundation models' clinical capabilities.

Method: Developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark with 1,245 questions from real orthopedic/sports medicine cases, assessing 7 clinical reasoning tasks. Evaluated 11 VLMs and 6 LLMs against expert ground truth.

Result: Models achieved >90% accuracy on structured multiple-choice questions but dropped to ~60% on open-ended multimodal tasks. VLMs showed severe limitations in medical image interpretation and text-driven hallucinations, ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Medical fine-tuned models showed no consistent advantage.

Conclusion: Current AI models lack clinical competence for complex multimodal reasoning. Safe deployment should be limited to supportive text-based roles. Future advancement requires fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global shortage of trained sonographers and barriers to fetal health monitoring by leveraging deep learning. Current lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating VLMs in fetal ultrasound imaging due to modality challenges, operator dependency, and limited public datasets.

Method: Created Fetal-Gauge benchmark with over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs covering multiple clinical tasks: anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. Systematically evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs including general-purpose and medical-specific models.

Result: Best-performing VLM achieved only 55% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Revealed substantial performance gap and critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation.

Conclusion: Fetal-Gauge establishes rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care. Highlights urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches to address global healthcare accessibility challenges. Benchmark will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver Monitoring Systems need to operate with low latency under strict compute, power, and cost constraints for real-world deployment. Current systems often struggle with false positives from visually similar behaviors and require expensive hardware.

Method: Three-component pipeline: (1) compact per-frame vision model optimized for edge devices, (2) confounder-aware label design to reduce false positives from visually similar actions, (3) temporal decision head that requires confident and sustained predictions before triggering alerts.

Result: Achieves 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 (INT8 inference, <60ms latency) and 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU. System covers 17 behavior classes and demonstrates stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware through real in-vehicle testing.

Conclusion: The system enables reliable real-time driver monitoring on low-cost edge hardware, providing a foundation for human-centered vehicle intelligence and emerging agentic vehicle concepts through upstream human-state perception.

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Result: Near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, controlled degradation under regrain, strong performance on surveillance-style benchmarks with low light/heavy compression.

Conclusion: Modular, data-efficient, practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps that maintains robustness under realistic conditions.

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

TL;DR: MoFu is a unified framework for multi-subject video generation that solves scale inconsistency and permutation sensitivity issues through Scale-Aware Modulation and Fourier Fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-subject video generation methods suffer from two key problems: scale inconsistency (unnatural subject sizes) and permutation sensitivity (subject distortion based on reference input order), which degrade visual quality and subject fidelity.

Method: 1) Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO): LLM-guided module extracts implicit scale cues from prompts to modulate features for consistent subject sizes. 2) Fourier Fusion: Processes reference features via Fast Fourier Transform to create unified, permutation-invariant representations. 3) Scale-Permutation Stability Loss: Jointly encourages scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation.

Result: MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality. The authors also established a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation for evaluation.

Conclusion: MoFu provides an effective unified solution to the challenges of scale inconsistency and permutation sensitivity in multi-subject video generation, achieving superior performance through its novel modulation and fusion strategies.

Abstract: Multi-subject video generation aims to synthesize videos from textual prompts and multiple reference images, ensuring that each subject preserves natural scale and visual fidelity. However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Consistently surpasses existing open-source models and rivals proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

Conclusion: VideoZoomer enables emergent capabilities for dynamic visual focus control in long video understanding, overcoming limitations of static frame sampling approaches through agentic, multi-turn interactive reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

### [97] [SpotEdit: Selective Region Editing in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22323)
*Zhibin Qin,Zhenxiong Tan,Zeqing Wang,Songhua Liu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpotEdit is a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only modified image regions instead of uniformly processing all tokens, reducing redundant computation while preserving unchanged areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformer models uniformly process and denoise all image tokens at every timestep during editing, even though most edits only modify small regions. This causes redundant computation and potentially degrades unchanged areas, raising the question of whether it's necessary to regenerate every region during editing.

Method: SpotEdit has two key components: 1) SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features, and 2) SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism to preserve contextual coherence and editing quality.

Result: By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

Conclusion: SpotEdit provides a training-free solution for selective region editing in diffusion models, addressing the inefficiency of uniform token processing while preserving editing quality and contextual coherence.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

*Jianrong Zhang,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeMoGen is a compositional training paradigm that decomposes holistic human motions into reusable semantic primitives using energy-based diffusion models, enabling both motion decomposition and novel recombination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion modeling approaches focus on forward composition (text-to-motion), but lack inverse decomposition capabilities to extract meaningful sub-components from complex motions for reuse and generalization.

Method: Energy-based diffusion model that captures composed distribution of multiple motion concepts; three training variants: DeMoGen-Exp (explicit decomposed text prompts), DeMoGen-OSS (orthogonal self-supervised decomposition), and DeMoGen-SC (semantic consistency enforcement).

Result: Successfully disentangles reusable motion primitives from complex sequences, enables flexible recombination to generate diverse novel motions beyond training distribution, and provides a text-decomposed dataset for compositional training.

Conclusion: DeMoGen offers an effective inverse perspective to motion understanding, enabling both decomposition of complex motions into semantic primitives and their recombination for novel motion generation, advancing compositional motion analysis.

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

*Mariya Miteva,Maria Nisheva-Pavlova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-view VAE framework integrates T1Gd and FLAIR MRI radiomic features for MGMT promoter methylation classification in glioblastoma, addressing limitations of conventional unimodal/early-fusion approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasive inference of MGMT promoter methylation status in glioblastoma is clinically important but conventional radiomics methods suffer from high feature redundancy and incomplete modeling of modality-specific information from multi-modal MRI.

Method: Multi-view variational autoencoder framework with independent probabilistic encoders for each modality (T1Gd and FLAIR MRI), performing fusion in compact latent space to preserve modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration.

Result: The approach generates latent embeddings that can be used for MGMT promoter methylation classification, addressing limitations of conventional radiomics methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-view VAE framework provides an effective solution for integrating complementary radiomic features from multi-modal MRI to infer molecular tumor characteristics non-invasively.

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

*Olaide N. Oyelade,Oliver Hoxey,Yulia Humrye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end vision transformer pipeline for HER2 scoring using both H&E and IHC whole slide images with pixel-level localization and 4-way classification (0, 1+, 2+, 3+).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HER2 scoring methods lack pixel-level localization and struggle with joint analysis of H&E and IHC images, despite both being clinically important for accurate HER2 protein expression assessment in cancer treatment.

Method: Single end-to-end pipeline using vision transformers with patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization, novel mapping function to correlate IHC regions with H&E malignant regions, and clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism for automatic pixel-level annotation.

Result: Achieved 0.94 classification accuracy and 0.933 specificity for 4-way HER2 scoring, with good tumor localization accuracy. Pipeline performance comparable to human pathologists on WSI patches.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end ViT-based model successfully enables joint evaluation of H&E and IHC images for accurate HER2 scoring with pixel-level localization, demonstrating clinical applicability.

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-like perceptual encoding (pseudo-coloring) improves data efficiency and explainability in ECG analysis using few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine vision models for ECG analysis require large datasets and lack interpretability, limiting clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning.

Method: Perception-informed pseudo-coloring technique encodes clinically salient temporal features (like QT-interval) into structured color representations. Uses prototypical networks and ResNet-18 architecture for one-shot/few-shot learning on ECG images from single cycles and full rhythms.

Result: Models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as 1-5 training examples. Pseudo-coloring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance.

Conclusion: Human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence, particularly for challenging cases like drug-induced LQTS.

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

TL;DR: MLLMs extended to 3D scene manipulation via MCP-based API, visual tools, and multi-agent framework, outperforming baselines on complex object arrangement tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite MLLMs' success in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored, with challenges in visual grounding, 3D scene understanding, and iterative error-prone updates.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) MCP-based API to shift from brittle raw code to robust function-level updates, 2) specialized visual tools for scene analysis and spatial information, 3) collaborative multi-agent framework with planning, execution, and verification roles.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on 25 complex object arrangement tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the gap between MLLMs and 3D scene manipulation, addressing key challenges in visual grounding, scene understanding, and error management through API design, visual tools, and multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

TL;DR: Self-E is a novel text-to-image model that trains from scratch with self-evaluation, enabling any-step inference without needing pretrained teachers or many steps like traditional diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between traditional diffusion/flow models (requiring many inference steps) and distillation approaches (needing pretrained teachers), creating a unified model that can generate high-quality images at any step count from scratch.

Method: Combines Flow Matching training with a novel self-evaluation mechanism where the model evaluates its own generated samples using current score estimates, acting as a dynamic self-teacher that provides both local supervision and global matching.

Result: Self-E excels at few-step generation while being competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps, with performance improving monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step and high-quality long-trajectory sampling.

Conclusion: Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation without relying on pretrained teachers or requiring many inference steps.

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeFloMat is a fast generative object detection framework using Conditional Flow Matching that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in just 3 inference steps, solving the latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based detectors like DiffusionDet suffer from critical latency bottlenecks due to requiring numerous sampling steps (T ≫ 60), making them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications such as Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).

Method: DeFloMat replaces the slow stochastic denoising process of diffusion models with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport theory, specifically approximating Rectified Flow. This enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver.

Result: DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (43.32% AP₁₀:₅₀) in only 3 inference steps, representing a 1.4× performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance (31.03% AP₁₀:₅₀ at 4 steps). It also shows superior localization characteristics with better Recall and stability in few-step regimes.

Conclusion: DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization in time-sensitive medical applications.

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy is fast and noninvasive but lacks robust volumetric segmentation without fluorescence or extensive post-processing. There's a need for direct segmentation from brightfield volumes.

Method: Bright-4B uses: 1) Native Sparse Attention for local/global context, 2) depth-width residual HyperConnections for stable representation flow, 3) soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity, and 4) anisotropic patch embedding respecting confocal geometry.

Result: The model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone, outperforming CNN and Transformer baselines across multiple confocal datasets while preserving fine structural detail.

Conclusion: Bright-4B enables large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping by providing accurate volumetric segmentation directly from brightfield microscopy without fluorescence or handcrafted post-processing.

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

TL;DR: FluenceFormer is a transformer-based framework for radiotherapy fluence map prediction that uses a two-stage approach with physics-informed loss to address long-range dependency issues in convolutional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current convolutional methods struggle with long-range dependencies in fluence map prediction, leading to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable radiotherapy plans. There's a need for better geometry-aware approaches that can handle the complex relationship between anatomy and beam modulation.

Method: Two-stage transformer framework: Stage 1 predicts global dose prior from anatomical inputs; Stage 2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Uses Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR) loss combining voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation.

Result: FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR backbone achieved best performance, reducing Energy Error to 4.5% and showing statistically significant gains in structural fidelity (p < 0.05) compared to CNN and single-stage methods on prostate IMRT dataset.

Conclusion: The transformer-based FluenceFormer framework effectively addresses long-range dependency issues in fluence map prediction, providing physically consistent and accurate radiotherapy planning through its two-stage design and physics-informed loss function.

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, while emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. There's a need for models that can generate images faithful to content descriptions while expressing specific target emotions.

Method: Proposes EmoCtrl with a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts. Incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. Uses learned emotion tokens that exhibit complementary effects.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods. User studies confirm strong alignment with human preference. The model generalizes well to creative applications, demonstrating robustness and adaptability of learned emotion tokens.

Conclusion: EmoCtrl successfully addresses the gap in controllable emotional image content generation, enabling both content fidelity and emotional expression through complementary textual and visual enhancement modules and learned emotion tokens.

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference. Moreover, EmoCtrl generalizes well to creative applications, further demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the learned emotion tokens.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperiorGAT: A graph attention framework that reconstructs missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds using beam-aware graphs and gated residual fusion, achieving better reconstruction than PointNet and deeper GAT models without increasing network depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR perception in autonomous systems faces limitations due to fixed vertical beam resolution and beam dropout from environmental occlusions, leading to sparse and incomplete point clouds that compromise perception accuracy.

Method: Models LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and uses a graph attention-based framework with gated residual fusion and feed-forward refinement to reconstruct missing elevation information without increasing network depth. Simulates structured beam dropout by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam for evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments (Person, Road, Campus, City sequences) show SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections confirm structural integrity preservation with minimal vertical distortion.

Conclusion: Architectural refinement through SuperiorGAT offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware, addressing beam dropout issues through intelligent reconstruction rather than hardware upgrades.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current event camera calibration methods are time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. There's a need for more efficient calibration approaches that leverage naturally occurring features in the environment.

Method: Proposes a line-based calibration framework that detects lines directly from event streams using an event-line calibration model to generate initial camera parameter guesses, suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then applies non-linear optimization to refine camera parameters.

Result: Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras. The method works effectively with common man-made objects like doors, windows, and boxes.

Conclusion: The proposed line-based event camera calibration method provides an efficient alternative to traditional calibration approaches by leveraging naturally occurring geometric lines in the environment, eliminating the need for manual calibration objects and enabling faster calibration suitable for dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential prerequisite for event-based vision applications. Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

*Zhicheng Zhao,Yuancheng Xu,Andong Lu,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QDFNet is a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network for robust optical-SAR object detection that addresses challenges of missing/degraded modalities through learnable reference tokens and orthogonal constraint fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical-SAR fusion faces practical deployment limitations due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, leading to missing/degraded modality data. Existing approaches lack robustness to random missing modalities and effective mechanisms for consistent performance improvement.

Method: Proposes QDFNet with two key modules: 1) Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) using learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment and identify degraded regions; 2) Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) employing orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores.

Result: Extensive experiments on SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate superiority and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

Conclusion: QDFNet provides a robust solution for optical-SAR object detection by dynamically assessing feature reliability and adaptively fusing modalities, effectively addressing practical challenges of missing/degraded data in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

*Md Abu Obaida Zishan,Annajiat Alim Rasel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SonoVision is a smartphone app that helps visually impaired people locate everyday objects using directional sound cues through headphones, working completely offline with EfficientDet-D2 object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in locating objects, which hinders their independence and can lead to dangerous situations. Current solutions often require reliance on others, so there's a need for technology that enables greater self-sufficiency.

Method: Developed a Flutter-based smartphone application that uses the EfficientDet-D2 model for object detection. The system provides directional audio cues through headphones: sinusoidal sounds in left/right ear for objects on respective sides, and simultaneous sounds in both ears for objects directly in front.

Result: Created a functional application that works completely offline, allowing visually impaired users to locate objects independently using their smartphones. The app is available as an open-source project on GitHub.

Conclusion: SonoVision provides a safe, user-friendly solution that reduces reliance on others and enhances independence for visually impaired individuals by leveraging smartphone technology and directional audio cues for object location.

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline. Our application can be accessed here https://github.com/MohammedZ666/SonoVision.git.

Conclusion: SAM 3D shows strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction, providing practical guidance for deploying foundation models and motivating integration of scene-level structural priors.

Abstract: Monocular 3D building reconstruction from remote sensing imagery is essential for scalable urban modeling, yet existing methods often require task-specific architectures and intensive supervision. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

TL;DR: This paper compares three computer vision models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) for autonomous mapping of electrical substation components to address vulnerabilities in critical grid infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrical substations are critical infrastructure vulnerable to various hazards, and traditional manual mapping is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Autonomous computer vision solutions are needed for efficient vulnerability assessment and failure prevention.

Method: The researchers trained and compared three computer vision models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images, evaluating detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency.

Result: The paper presents comparative evaluation results showing the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. The models were successfully applied to map various substation components across the United States.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can effectively automate substation component mapping, providing a scalable solution for vulnerability assessment of critical electrical grid infrastructure, with one model identified as particularly suitable for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

### [115] [Pose-Guided Residual Refinement for Interpretable Text-to-Motion Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22464)
*Sukhyun Jeong,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGR²M introduces a hybrid motion representation combining interpretable pose codes with residual codes to capture both global structure and fine-grained temporal details for better text-based 3D motion generation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose-code-based frameworks like CoMo struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details due to their frame-wise representation, degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability in text-based motion generation and editing.

Method: Proposes PGR²M with pose-guided residual refinement: uses residual vector quantization (RVQ) to decompose motion into pose latents (coarse structure) and residual latents (fine-grained variations). Includes residual dropout to prevent over-reliance on residuals. Uses two Transformers - base Transformer for pose codes from text, and refine Transformer for residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage.

Result: Improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets for both generation and editing compared to CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines. User studies confirm intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Conclusion: PGR²M's hybrid representation effectively addresses limitations of pose-code-based frameworks by capturing both global structure and fine temporal details, enabling better motion generation and editing while maintaining interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

TL;DR: Novel framework using multiple event cameras to measure shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution, achieving high-precision measurement with errors as low as 0.06%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters is essential for power field testing and damage assessment, but current methods struggle with fast, uneven propagation and unstable testing conditions.

Method: Uses multiple event cameras to estimate shock wave asymmetry; establishes polar coordinate system to encode events, extracts adaptive ROI via event offset calculations, extracts shock wave front events using iterative slope analysis, and derives geometric models for 3D reconstruction and motion parameter estimation.

Result: Achieves multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion; speed measurements show maximum error of 5.20% and minimum error of 0.06% compared to pressure sensors and empirical formulas.

Conclusion: The method enables high-precision measurement of shock wave motion fields with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress in shock wave measurement technology.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised paradigm for infrared small object detection using hierarchical MoE adapters to distill SAM into Scalpel-SAM, then transfer knowledge to lightweight models with minimal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small object detection requires expensive annotations, creating a need for semi-supervised approaches. Existing methods like SAM have domain gaps, lack physical priors, and are architecturally complex.

Method: Two-stage paradigm: 1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation using hierarchical MoE adapter with 10% supervised data to create Scalpel-SAM from SAM; 2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer using Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight downstream models.

Result: With minimal annotations, downstream models achieve performance comparable to or surpassing fully supervised counterparts. First semi-supervised paradigm systematically addressing IR-SOT data scarcity using SAM as teacher.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical MoE adapter and two-stage knowledge distillation/transfer paradigm effectively solves infrared small object detection's annotation scarcity problem while maintaining performance with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-GMAE is a self-supervised video representation learning method that encodes video frames into moving Gaussian splats, enabling emergent tracking capabilities and achieving state-of-the-art performance on video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a self-supervised approach for video representation learning that leverages the inherent 3D structure of dynamic scenes. By representing videos as sets of Gaussians moving over time, the method enforces an inductive bias that 2D videos are projections of 3D scenes, which should lead to better understanding of object motion and scene dynamics.

Method: Video-GMAE uses a masked autoencoder architecture that encodes video sequences into sets of Gaussian splats that move over time. The method learns to reconstruct masked portions of videos by representing them as dynamic 3D Gaussian distributions, which naturally encourages the model to track objects and understand scene geometry.

Result: The method demonstrates emergent tracking capabilities - mapping Gaussian trajectories to the image plane achieves zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. With finetuning, it achieves 34.6% improvement on Kinetics and 13.1% improvement on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Conclusion: Video-GMAE successfully leverages 3D Gaussian representations for self-supervised video learning, demonstrating that tracking emerges naturally from this architecture and achieving superior performance on video understanding benchmarks compared to existing self-supervised methods.

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Conclusion: SCAFusion effectively addresses the challenges of multimodal 3D perception in lunar environments, providing reliable detection of small irregular objects with minimal parameter/computation overhead, making it suitable for autonomous lunar surface exploration.

Abstract: Reliable and precise detection of small and irregular objects, such as meteor fragments and rocks, is critical for autonomous navigation and operation in lunar surface exploration. Existing multimodal 3D perception methods designed for terrestrial autonomous driving often underperform in off world environments due to poor feature alignment, limited multimodal synergy, and weak small object detection.

Built upon the BEVFusion framework, SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter for efficient camera backbone tuning, a Contrastive Alignment Module to enhance camera LiDAR feature consistency, a Camera Auxiliary Training Branch to strengthen visual representation, and most importantly, a Section aware Coordinate Attention mechanism explicitly designed to boost the detection performance of small, irregular targets. With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In simulated lunar environments built on Isaac Sim, SCAFusion achieves 90.93% mAP, outperforming the baseline by 11.5%, with notable gains in detecting small meteor like obstacles.

TL;DR: DreamOmni3 introduces scribble-based editing and generation tasks using multimodal inputs (text, images, sketches) with a novel joint input scheme that processes both original and scribbled images simultaneously for precise localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified generation/editing models rely mainly on text prompts, but language often fails to capture users' intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. There's a need for more flexible creation combining textual, image, and freehand sketch inputs.

Method: Two-part approach: 1) Data synthesis pipeline for scribble-based editing (4 tasks) and generation (3 tasks) using DreamOmni2 dataset with editable regions overlaid with hand-drawn elements; 2) Framework design with joint input scheme that feeds both original and scribbled source images using different colors to distinguish regions, applying same index and position encodings for precise localization.

Result: DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance on comprehensive benchmarks established for scribble-based editing and generation tasks. Models and code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: The proposed scribble-based editing and generation tasks enable more flexible multimodal creation, and DreamOmni3's joint input scheme effectively handles complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions while maintaining precise localization.

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: CoAgent is a collaborative closed-loop framework for coherent long-form video generation that addresses identity drift and scene inconsistency through a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline with entity memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models treat shots independently, causing identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure in open-domain video generation.

Method: Plan-synthesize-verify pipeline: Storyboard Planner decomposes prompts into shot-level plans, Global Context Manager maintains entity memory, Synthesis Module generates shots with Visual Consistency Controller, Verifier Agent evaluates with vision-language reasoning, and pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CoAgent provides an effective collaborative framework for maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency in open-domain video generation through its closed-loop plan-synthesize-verify architecture.

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent but unreliable reasoning with weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, because existing alignment approaches only supervise final answers while ignoring the reliability of intermediate reasoning processes.

Method: SR-MCR integrates five self-referential cues (semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, step consistency) into a normalized reliability-weighted reward for fine-grained process-level guidance. Uses critic-free GRPO objective with confidence-aware cooling mechanism to stabilize training and suppress trivial/overconfident generations.

Result: Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across visual benchmarks. SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models of comparable size with 81.4% average accuracy. Ablation studies confirm contributions of each reward term and cooling module.

Conclusion: SR-MCR provides an effective, lightweight approach to align multimodal LLM reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals, addressing the limitation of final-answer-only supervision and improving both accuracy and coherence of reasoning processes.

Conclusion: The proposed ReFRM3D network with radiomics-enhanced features significantly improves glioma segmentation and classification performance across multiple BraTS datasets, addressing key challenges in glioma diagnosis.

Abstract: Gliomas are among the most aggressive cancers, characterized by high mortality rates and complex diagnostic processes. Existing studies on glioma diagnosis and classification often describe issues such as high variability in imaging data, inadequate optimization of computational resources, and inefficient segmentation and classification of gliomas. To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

*Marwan Taher,Ignacio Alzugaray,Kirill Mazur,Xin Kong,Andrew J. Davison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Tracker enables real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction from monocular RGB videos by caching key-value pairs from multi-view 3D geometry networks, achieving 15× speedup without drift or forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D geometry networks provide strong priors but are too slow for real-time applications. There's a need to adapt these powerful networks for online use in pose tracking and reconstruction tasks.

Method: The method selects/manages keyframe images for scene mapping via π³ with bidirectional attention, then caches the global self-attention block's key-value pairs as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This caching strategy is model-agnostic and doesn't require retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 15× speedup during inference, maintains high frame rates (~27 FPS), and demonstrates strong performance on TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic, and OnePose datasets for both scene-level and object tracking/reconstruction without depth or object priors.

Conclusion: KV-Tracker successfully adapts powerful but slow multi-view 3D geometry networks for real-time applications through an efficient KV caching strategy, enabling fast, drift-free pose tracking and online reconstruction from monocular RGB video.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

### [125] [PTalker: Personalized Speech-Driven 3D Talking Head Animation via Style Disentanglement and Modality Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22602)
*Bin Wang,Yang Xu,Huan Zhao,Hao Zhang,Zixing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTalker is a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation that preserves individual speaking styles through style disentanglement and improves lip-sync accuracy via a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-driven 3D talking head generation methods focus on lip-sync accuracy but overlook individual speaking style nuances, limiting personalization and realism. There's a need to capture identity-specific speaking styles while maintaining precise synchronization.

Method: PTalker uses style disentanglement constraints to separate style and content from audio and motion sequences. It employs a three-level alignment mechanism: spatial alignment with Graph Attention Networks for mesh structure, temporal alignment with cross-attention for synchronization, and feature alignment with top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show PTalker generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: PTalker successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by preserving individual speaking styles while maintaining high lip-synchronization accuracy, advancing personalized 3D talking head animation toward greater realism and personalization.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [126] [Enhancing Noise Resilience in Face Clustering via Sparse Differential Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22612)
*Dafeng Zhang,Yongqi Song,Shizhuo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SDT (Sparse Differential Transformer) with prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity for more accurate face clustering by enhancing neighbor purity and reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face clustering methods using Jaccard similarity coefficients introduce too many irrelevant nodes, limiting discriminative power and clustering performance. Current approaches struggle with predicting optimal neighbor counts (Top-K) and suffer from noise in relationship prediction.

Method: 1) Prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient to enhance neighbor purity; 2) Transformer-based prediction model to examine relationships near Top-K; 3) Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT) instead of vanilla Transformer to eliminate noise and enhance anti-noise capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets (including MS-Celeb-1M) show state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods and providing more robust face clustering solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed SDT with prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity effectively addresses noise issues in face clustering, improves similarity measurement reliability, and achieves superior clustering performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dream-VL is a diffusion-based vision-language model that outperforms autoregressive VLMs on visual planning tasks, and Dream-VLA extends this to vision-language-action models achieving state-of-the-art robotic control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive VLMs have limitations in complex visual planning and robotic control due to sequential generation. The authors investigate diffusion-based LLMs as a better foundation for these tasks due to their bidirectional nature and parallel generation capabilities.

Method: Develop Dream-VL as an open diffusion-based VLM using diffusion-based LLMs as backbone. Then create Dream-VLA through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets, leveraging the diffusion backbone's bidirectional nature for action chunking and parallel generation.

Result: Dream-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance among dVLMs and is comparable to top AR-based VLMs. Dream-VLA achieves 97.2% success on LIBERO, 71.4% on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models like π₀ and GR00T-N1.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based backbones are superior for VLA tasks due to their bidirectional nature, enabling faster convergence and better performance in visual planning and robotic control compared to autoregressive models.

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

### [128] [Rethinking Memory Design in SAM-Based Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22624)
*Mohamad Alansari,Muzammal Naseer,Hasan Al Marzouqi,Naoufel Werghi,Sajid Javed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study of memory mechanisms in SAM-based visual object tracking, proposing a unified hybrid memory framework that decomposes memory into short-term appearance and long-term distractor-resolving components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based trackers address memory limitations in method-specific ways without clear design principles, and it's unclear how these mechanisms transfer to next-generation models like SAM3.

Method: Analyzed representative SAM2-based trackers, reimplemented memory mechanisms in SAM3 framework, conducted large-scale evaluations across 10 benchmarks, and proposed a unified hybrid memory framework with explicit decomposition into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory.

Result: The proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Conclusion: A systematic memory-centric approach with explicit decomposition into short-term and long-term memory components provides principled improvements for SAM-based visual object tracking across different backbone models.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Envision is a diffusion-based visual planning framework that generates goal-constrained video trajectories for embodied agents, addressing spatial drift and goal misalignment in existing forward-predictive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models for embodied visual planning are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories from initial observations without explicit goal modeling, leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. There's a need for a framework that enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout generated trajectories.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between scene and instruction, and synthesizes coherent goal images; 2) Env-Goal Video Model uses a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V) to interpolate between initial observation and goal image, producing smooth, physically plausible video trajectories.

Result: Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks show Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control.

Conclusion: Envision provides a reliable visual planning framework for embodied agents by explicitly constraining trajectory generation with goal images, enabling physically plausible and goal-consistent visual imagination that addresses limitations of forward-predictive approaches.

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

*Yidi Liu,Zihao Fan,Jie Huang,Jie Xiao,Dong Li,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Xueyang Fu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FinPercep-RM, a fine-grained perceptual reward model for RLHF in image super-resolution, with co-evolutionary curriculum learning to address training instability and reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models output single global scores insensitive to local distortions, causing ISR models to produce artifacts that get spurious high scores (reward hacking), misaligning optimization with perceptual quality.

Method: 1) FinPercep-RM: Encoder-Decoder architecture that outputs both global quality score and Perceptual Degradation Map for spatial localization of defects. 2) FGR-30k dataset with diverse subtle distortions. 3) Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL): synchronized curricula where reward model complexity increases while ISR model starts with simple global reward, gradually transitioning to complex outputs.

Result: Experiments validate effectiveness across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods, suppressing reward hacking and enabling stable training.

Conclusion: The proposed FinPercep-RM with CCL mechanism addresses limitations of traditional IQA models in RLHF for ISR, providing fine-grained perceptual feedback while maintaining training stability through synchronized curriculum learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models for automated LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos achieve RMSE of 6.79% using modified 3D Inception architectures, with smaller/simpler models showing better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual LVEF assessment from echocardiograms is time-consuming and has high inter-observer variability. Deep learning offers a promising automated alternative with potential expert-level performance.

Method: Evaluated multiple deep learning architectures (3D Inception, two-stream, CNN-RNN) for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Systematically tested architectural modifications and fusion strategies on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset (10,030 videos).

Result: Modified 3D Inception achieved best performance with RMSE of 6.79%. Smaller/simpler models showed better generalization due to overfitting tendency. Performance highly sensitive to hyperparameters like kernel sizes and normalization strategies.

Conclusion: Deep learning can effectively automate LVEF estimation from echocardiography. Architectural insights from this study may generalize to other medical/non-medical video analysis tasks.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

Conclusion: CLAdapter effectively unleashes the potential of foundation vision models through adaptive transfer, enabling models to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets and adapt from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios.

Abstract: In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge.

In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts.

Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models have high visual fidelity but often fail to semantically align with complex prompts, lacking proper understanding of prompt intent and details.

Result: Significant improvements in human-aligned metrics for text-to-image correspondence and visual quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations comparable to reward optimization approaches.

Conclusion: CritiFusion effectively enhances semantic alignment and detail preservation in text-to-image generation through semantic critique and spectral refinement, serving as a plug-in solution for existing diffusion models without additional training.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion prediction models are trained on narrow distributions and struggle with complex motions. While video prediction models have achieved visual realism through scaling, they still fail to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale.

Method: Developed autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a probabilistic modeling method for sequential continuous data, trained on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons.

Result: The model successfully predicts complex motions, and conditioning robot action prediction and human motion prediction on predicted future tracks significantly improves downstream task performance.

Conclusion: ARFM enables accurate prediction of complex motions over long horizons, and using predicted future tracks as conditioning significantly enhances performance in both human motion prediction and robot action prediction tasks.

Abstract: Motion prediction has been studied in different contexts with models trained on narrow distributions and applied to downstream tasks in human motion prediction and robotics. Simultaneously, recent efforts in scaling video prediction have demonstrated impressive visual realism, yet they struggle to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale. Inspired by the scaling of video generation, we develop autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a new method for probabilistic modeling of sequential continuous data and train it on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons. To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion. Our model is able to predict complex motions, and we demonstrate that conditioning robot action prediction and human motion prediction on predicted future tracks can significantly improve downstream task performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal diffeomorphic registration using Neural ODEs with structural descriptors for modality-agnostic registration without requiring large training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nonrigid registration methods face tradeoffs between accuracy, computational complexity, and regularization, and are limited to monomodal settings due to assumptions about intensity correlation. Learning-based models require large training datasets and suffer performance degradation on unseen modalities.

Method: Proposes an instance-specific framework using Neural ODEs with structural descriptors as modality-agnostic metric models. Three variants integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors with nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information.

Result: Surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines for both large and small deformations in multimodal registration. Shows robustness to varying regularization levels, suitability for registration at varying scales, and efficiency compared to other large-deformation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural ODEs with structural descriptors provides an effective, instance-specific solution that overcomes limitations of traditional registration methods and learning-based approaches, enabling robust multimodal registration without requiring large training datasets.

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

*Paul Dobre,Jackson Cooper,Xin Wang,Hongzhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCPainter is a unified framework that combines 3D Gaussian Splat car assets with diffusion-based generation to enable realistic 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis for autonomous driving simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving needs diverse training data covering long-tailed scenarios. Current methods treat 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis separately, lacking realistic integration. A unified framework is needed to create diverse, realistic driving scenarios for better model training.

Method: SCPainter integrates 3D Gaussian Splat car asset representations with 3D scene point clouds and uses diffusion-based generation. It projects both assets and scene point clouds into novel views, then conditions a diffusion model on these projections to generate high-quality images.

Result: Evaluation on Waymo Open Dataset shows the framework successfully enables realistic 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis, facilitating creation of diverse and realistic driving data for training.

Conclusion: SCPainter provides a unified solution that combines realistic 3D asset insertion with novel view synthesis, addressing the need for diverse, high-quality training data in autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining (USF-MAE) on 370k unlabeled ultrasound images improves automated detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester scans compared to supervised DenseNet-169 baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal finding with poor outcomes, but supervised deep learning for automated detection is limited by small labeled datasets. Self-supervised pretraining could enable more accurate and robust detection.

Method: Fine-tuned Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) pretrained on 370k+ unlabeled ultrasound images for binary classification of normal vs cystic hygroma cases. Compared to DenseNet-169 baseline using same dataset, preprocessing, and 4-fold cross-validation.

Result: USF-MAE outperformed DenseNet-169 on all metrics: accuracy 0.96 vs 0.93, sensitivity 0.94 vs 0.92, specificity 0.98 vs 0.94, ROC-AUC 0.98 vs 0.94. Score-CAM visualizations showed clinically relevant attention to fetal neck regions. Improvements were statistically significant (p=0.0057).

Conclusion: Ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining enables accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma, overcoming limitations of small labeled datasets and supporting scalable early screening programs.

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

TL;DR: Freetime FeatureGS enables decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos without relying on unstable video segmentation, using learnable Gaussian primitives with linear motion and contrastive feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for decomposed 4D scene reconstruction rely heavily on video segmentation quality, which is often unstable and leads to unreliable reconstruction results. The authors aim to eliminate this dependency.

Method: Proposes Freetime FeatureGS representing dynamic scenes as Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion. Uses contrastive loss to align primitive features with 2D segmentation maps, and implements streaming feature learning with temporally ordered sampling for optimization.

Result: Experimental results on several datasets show the method outperforms recent approaches by a large margin in reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves decomposed 4D scene reconstruction without needing video segmentation, using temporal feature propagation and contrastive learning to overcome optimization challenges.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Bo Huang,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive visual token pruning method for Large Multimodal Models that handles long context inputs with multiple images by dynamically allocating token budgets based on intra-image diversity and inter-image variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of visual tokens in LMMs greatly increases inference costs, especially in scenarios with long context inputs containing multiple images. Existing visual token pruning methods often overlook these multi-image, long-context scenarios.

Method: Two-stage adaptive pruning: 1) Intra-image stage allocates content-aware token budgets per image and greedily selects most representative tokens; 2) Inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool, then applies Pareto selection balancing diversity with text alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly reducing the number of visual tokens, effectively cutting down inference costs.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive visual token pruning method successfully addresses the challenges of multi-image, long-context scenarios in LMMs by decomposing redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and using dynamic budget allocation guided by diversity and variation metrics.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

Motivation: Vision Transformers have computational inefficiency due to redundant token representations. Existing token merging/pruning methods overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, causing loss of local context.

Method: Proposes neighbor-aware token reduction using Hilbert curve reordering to preserve 2D neighbor structure in 1D sequential representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantics and dynamics understanding is crucial for embodied agents, but these tasks have high data redundancy. Current methods lack principled approaches for selecting informative views from multi-camera setups.

Method: Formulates view selection as active learning problem, proposes algorithm using Fisher Information to quantify informativeness of candidate views for both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks.

Result: Method consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets, outperforming random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

Conclusion: The Fisher Information-based active learning approach provides a principled alternative to heuristic strategies for joint semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling in multi-camera setups.

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes AGQG, an Arithmetic GRM-based Quality Grading module that addresses semantic drift in AGIQA models by modeling image quality assessment as a psychometric graded response problem with monotonic difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AGIQA models suffer from "semantic drift" where image embeddings show inconsistent similarities across quality grades, undermining reliability of text-image shared-space learning. The multimodal similarity distributions across grades create semantic inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes Arithmetic GRM-based Quality Grading (AGQG) module inspired by psychometric Graded Response Model. Uses two-branch design: one estimates image ability, the other constructs multiple difficulty levels with arithmetic modeling to ensure monotonicity and unimodal quality distribution.

Result: AGQG module shows plug-and-play advantage, consistently improves performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks, and generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed AGQG module addresses semantic drift in AGIQA by providing a psychometrically-inspired framework with monotonic difficulty modeling, offering a potential key component for future IQA models with improved reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPD-Solver is a novel ODE solver for diffusion models that uses parallel gradient evaluations to reduce truncation errors while maintaining low latency through full parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high sampling latency due to sequential denoising, and existing acceleration methods suffer from image quality degradation under low-latency budgets due to accumulated truncation errors from high-curvature trajectory segments.

Method: EPD-Solver incorporates multiple parallel gradient evaluations per step using Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions, with a two-stage optimization: 1) distillation-based parameter learning, and 2) parameter-efficient RL fine-tuning using stochastic Dirichlet policy that operates only in solver space. Also works as EPD-Plugin for existing ODE samplers.

Result: The method mitigates truncation errors while preserving low-latency sampling through full parallelization of independent gradient computations, and effectively addresses reward hacking in complex text-to-image generation tasks.

Conclusion: EPD-Solver provides an effective solution to accelerate diffusion model sampling while maintaining image quality, with flexible plugin capability for existing ODE samplers and efficient RL fine-tuning that avoids modifying the backbone model.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods are limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. There's a need for more robust tracking that can locate targets across the entire image space.

Method: Proposes VPTracker, a global tracking framework using Multimodal Large Language Models with location-aware visual prompting. The method constructs region-level prompts based on the target's previous location, enabling prioritized region-level recognition and resorting to global inference only when necessary.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content while retaining global tracking advantages.

Conclusion: The work opens a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking by demonstrating how global search with semantic reasoning can overcome limitations of local tracking methods, with location-aware prompting addressing distraction issues.

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Motivation: To assess how open-vocabulary object detection models perform under real-world low-quality image conditions, which is important for practical applications where image quality varies.

Method: Created a new dataset simulating real-world low-quality images and evaluated multiple open-vocabulary detection models (OWLv2, OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, Detic) under different degradation levels.

Result: Models showed no significant mAP decrease under low-level degradation, but all models dropped sharply under high-level degradation. OWLv2 performed consistently better across degradation types, while other models showed significant performance declines.

Conclusion: Open-vocabulary detection models are sensitive to high-level image degradation, highlighting the need for robustness improvements. OWLv2 demonstrates better resilience, and the released dataset will support future research on model robustness.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to localize and recognize objects beyond a predefined set of categories and is expected to achieve recognition capabilities comparable to human performance. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

Method: 1) Construct Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment with spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction pairs. 2) Develop EgoReAct framework: compress reaction motion into compact latent space via Vector Quantised-VAE, then train Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from visual input. 3) Incorporate 3D dynamic features (metric depth and head dynamics) to enhance spatial grounding.

Result: EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods while maintaining strict causality during generation. The framework operates in real-time from egocentric video streams.

Conclusion: EgoReAct successfully addresses the dual challenges of causal generation and 3D spatial alignment for human reaction modeling from egocentric video, enabled by the new HRD dataset and the novel autoregressive framework with 3D feature integration.

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

*Hualie Jiang,Ziyang Song,Zhiqiang Lou,Rui Xu,Minglang Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA360 adapts Depth Anything V2 for panoramic depth estimation by learning a shift parameter and using circular padding, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on indoor/outdoor benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic depth estimation has limited zero-shot generalization to open-world domains compared to perspective images, creating a need to transfer capabilities from the perspective domain to panoramic settings.

Method: Adapts Depth Anything V2 for panoramic use by learning a shift parameter from ViT backbone to transform scale-and-shift-invariant output into scale-invariant estimates, plus circular padding in DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts and ensure spherical continuity.

Result: Achieves over 50% and 10% relative depth error reduction on indoor/outdoor benchmarks respectively, outperforms robust panoramic methods by ~30% relative error improvement compared to PanDA, establishing new SOTA for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

Conclusion: DA360 successfully bridges the gap between perspective and panoramic depth estimation, demonstrating effective transfer of capabilities and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation across diverse environments.

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image SR is challenging due to nonlinear degradation, complex physical interactions, and uncertainty. Existing interpretable SR methods rely on black-box deep networks, leaving degradation processes unknown and uncontrollable.

Method: Proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO) using additive structure of finite B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves piecewise. Learns and optimizes spline shape parameters to capture key spectral characteristics like local linear trends and peak-valley structures.

Result: KANO provides transparent and structured representation of latent degradation fitting process. Systematic comparison of MLPs and KANs in handling complex sequence fitting tasks across natural images, aerial photos, and satellite remote sensing data.

Conclusion: KANO endows SR results with physical interpretability by accurately capturing spectral characteristics. Comparative study elucidates advantages/limitations of models in characterizing degradation mechanisms, offering insights for interpretable SR techniques.

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D change detection methods suffer from spatial inconsistency in detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states, limiting their effectiveness for scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction.

Method: The approach uses a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) consistency to robustly separate pre- and post-change states.

Conclusion: SCaR-3D effectively addresses limitations of existing 3D change detection methods by providing spatially consistent change detection with explicit separation of pre- and post-change states, enabling robust scene monitoring and continual reconstruction.

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states.

Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas.

### [153] [A Minimal Solver for Relative Pose Estimation with Unknown Focal Length from Two Affine Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22833)
*Zhenbao Yu,Shirong Ye,Ronghe Jin,Shunkun Liang,Zibin Liu,Huiyun Zhang,Banglei Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new solver that estimates 3DOF relative pose and focal length from two affine correspondences when vertical direction is known from IMU measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In applications like self-driving cars, smartphones, and UAVs where cameras are combined with IMUs, the vertical direction can be obtained from IMU measurements, reducing the relative pose estimation problem from 5DOF to 3DOF. This enables more efficient estimation using fewer correspondences.

Method: 1) Establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences with known vertical direction; 2) Derive four equations involving only focal length and relative rotation angle based on equation system properties; 3) Use polynomial eigenvalue method to solve for focal length and rotation angle.

Result: The proposed solver outperforms existing state-of-the-art solvers in evaluations using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully leverages IMU-provided vertical direction to reduce DOF and enables efficient relative pose and focal length estimation from just two affine correspondences, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI video generation methods have two critical limitations: poor cross-view consistency due to ineffective multi-view object information injection, and heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions.

Method: Proposes ByteLoom, a DiT-based framework with: 1) RCM-cache mechanism using Relative Coordinate Maps as universal representation for geometry consistency and 6-DoF object transformation control, and 2) progressive training curriculum to compensate dataset scarcity and reduce hand mesh dependency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method faithfully preserves human identity and object's multi-view geometry while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

Conclusion: ByteLoom addresses key limitations in HOI video generation by improving cross-view consistency through better object geometry representation and reducing annotation requirements through progressive training.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

Conclusion: MUSON addresses limitations of existing datasets by providing structured reasoning supervision and balanced action distributions, serving as an effective benchmark for developing socially compliant navigation models, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lamps is a self-supervised learning framework for medical imaging that leverages anatomical consistency, coherence, and hierarchy as supervision signals to learn meaningful representations from chest radiographs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods in medical imaging overlook the fundamental anatomical structure of human body images, which is the key foundation in medical imaging (unlike NLP/vision where foundation is language structure). This limits their ability to learn effective anatomical features.

Method: Lamps pre-trains on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing three anatomical properties as supervision signals: consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. This multi-perspective approach aligns learning with anatomical structure.

Result: Extensive experiments across 10 datasets show Lamps outperforms 10 baseline models in robustness, transferability, and clinical potential. Fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate superior performance.

Conclusion: By learning from multiple anatomical perspectives, Lamps enables foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations aligned with human anatomy structure, offering unique opportunities for medical imaging foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

*Weiwei Li,Junzhuo Liu,Yuanyuan Ren,Yuchen Zheng,Yahao Liu,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a data-oriented pipeline (NSF) to mitigate spurious correlations in deep learning by identifying, neutralizing, eliminating spurious features, and updating the classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing spurious correlations require annotation of spurious attributes or rely on empirical assumptions about bias simplicity, which may fail with complex real-world spurious correlations.

Method: Four-step pipeline: 1) Identify spurious features by observing dispersed distribution of affected samples in feature space, 2) Obtain bias-invariant representation via grouping strategy, 3) Learn feature transformation to eliminate spurious features by aligning with bias-invariant representation, 4) Update classifier with learned transformation.

Result: Achieves over 20% improvement in worst group accuracy compared to standard ERM on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Proposed NSF pipeline effectively mitigates spurious correlations without requiring spurious attribute annotations or relying on empirical assumptions about bias simplicity.

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ErasureBench is a multimodal evaluation framework that benchmarks concept erasure methods across text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents, revealing vulnerabilities in existing approaches. The paper proposes IRECE, a plug-and-play module that enhances robustness by localizing target concepts via cross-attention and perturbing associated latents during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods focus only on text prompts, ignoring other input modalities like learned embeddings and inverted latents that are increasingly important in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can serve as attack surfaces where erased concepts can re-emerge despite existing defenses.

Method: The paper introduces M-ErasureBench, a multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents (with both white-box and black-box access). To address vulnerabilities, they propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), which localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during the denoising process.

Result: Existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in white-box settings. IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts, revealing critical vulnerabilities in existing methods. Together with IRECE, the benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models that are robust across multiple input modalities.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

Motivation: Existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely solely on visual learning from large annotated datasets, limiting adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. They lack semantic understanding to address flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives.

Method: Proposes SwinTF3D with transformer-based visual encoder for volumetric features, compact text encoder, and efficient fusion mechanism to align semantic cues with spatial structures in medical volumes.

Result: Achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores on BTCV dataset across multiple organs, generalizes well to unseen data, and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks.

Conclusion: Establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.

Abstract: The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPS (Guided Path Sampling) fixes stability issues in diffusion model refinement by replacing CFG's extrapolation with manifold-constrained interpolation, enabling better iterative refinement with optimal guidance scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) causes iterative refinement methods to fail because its extrapolative nature pushes sampling paths off the data manifold, leading to diverging approximation errors and undermining the refinement process.

Method: Proposes Guided Path Sampling (GPS) which replaces CFG's unstable extrapolation with principled, manifold-constrained interpolation to keep sampling paths on the data manifold. Also develops optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength to align with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process.

Result: GPS outperforms existing methods on SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT, achieving superior ImageReward (0.79) and HPS v2 (0.2995) on SDXL, and improving semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Theoretically proves error series transforms from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded.

Conclusion: Path stability is essential for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it by ensuring sampling paths remain on the data manifold through constrained interpolation rather than extrapolation.

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hash grid feature pruning method for Gaussian splatting that removes invalid features to reduce storage/transmission overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hash grids used in Gaussian splatting have many invalid features due to irregular distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, causing redundant storage and transmission overhead.

Method: Proposes a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on input Gaussian splat coordinates, encoding only valid features.

Result: Reduces hash grid storage size without compromising model performance, achieving 8% average bitrate reduction compared to baseline under Common Test Conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed feature pruning method effectively eliminates redundant features in hash grids for Gaussian splatting, improving rate-distortion performance through reduced storage requirements.

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.

*Qihang Peng,Xuesong Chen,Chenye Yang,Shaoshuai Shi,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColaVLA is a vision-language-action framework for autonomous driving that transfers VLM reasoning to a latent space and uses hierarchical parallel planning for efficient, real-time trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based planners face challenges: (1) mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (2) high latency from autoregressive decoding, and (3) inefficient/non-causal planners limiting real-time deployment. The paper aims to preserve VLM generalization while enabling efficient trajectory generation.

Method: Two main components: 1) Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into decision-oriented meta-action embeddings using ego-adaptive selection with only two VLM forward passes. 2) Hierarchical Parallel Planner generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass.

Result: ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between VLM reasoning and continuous control, enabling efficient, accurate, and safe trajectory generation while preserving VLM generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRMNet uses density maps as spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning for detecting dense tiny objects in remote sensing imagery, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution remote sensing imagery contains dense clusters of tiny objects that are challenging to detect due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing methods allocate computational resources uniformly and fail to adaptively focus on density-concentrated regions, hindering feature learning effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet) with three key components: 1) Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns as quantifiable priors, 2) Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) that uses density maps to identify and focus on dense areas for efficient local-global feature interaction, and 3) Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM) that disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using discrete cosine transform and performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference.

Result: Extensive experiments on AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

Conclusion: DRMNet effectively addresses the challenges of detecting dense tiny objects in remote sensing imagery by leveraging density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning, focusing computational resources on critical dense regions, and enhancing feature complementarity through frequency-domain analysis and cross-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

TL;DR: CLIP-Joint-Detect integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision into object detection via joint training, improving performance while maintaining real-time speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional object detectors using cross-entropy classification are vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise, limiting their robustness and performance.

Method: A lightweight parallel head projects region/grid features into CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings using InfoNCE contrastive loss and auxiliary cross-entropy, while maintaining all standard detection losses.

Result: Achieves consistent and substantial improvements on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 (with Faster R-CNN) and MS COCO 2017 (with YOLOv11) while preserving real-time inference speed.

Conclusion: Joint optimization with learnable text embeddings significantly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets in a detector-agnostic manner.

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WRCFormer is a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw 4D radar cubes with camera data using multi-view representations and wavelet-based attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on K-Radar benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D mmWave radar is cost-effective and robust for autonomous driving but suffers from sparsity and limited semantic information. While camera-radar fusion is promising, point-cloud-based radar loses information through processing, and raw radar data is computationally expensive to use directly.

Method: WRCFormer fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of decoupled radar cube. It uses a Wavelet Attention Module in wavelet-based FPN to enhance sparse radar and image representations, and a two-stage query-based Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion mechanism to integrate multi-view features from both modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by ~2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in sleet scenario, demonstrating robustness under adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: WRCFormer effectively addresses computational challenges of raw radar data while leveraging its full information, providing a robust fusion framework for 3D object detection in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-IOD: A real-time incremental object detection framework based on YOLO-World that addresses catastrophic forgetting through conflict-aware pseudo-label refinement, importance-based kernel selection, and cross-stage asymmetric knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current incremental object detection methods rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR detectors and don't support real-time YOLO frameworks. The paper identifies three knowledge conflicts causing catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors and aims to create a real-time IOD solution.

Method: YOLO-IOD uses pretrained YOLO-World with stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Three main components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR) to mitigate foreground-background confusion, 2) Importance-based Kernel Selection (IKS) to identify and update pivotal convolution kernels, and 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) to address misaligned knowledge distillation through asymmetric feature transmission between teacher detectors.

Result: The method is evaluated on both conventional and new LoCo COCO benchmarks (which eliminates data leakage). Experiments show YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: YOLO-IOD successfully enables real-time incremental object detection on YOLO frameworks by addressing three key knowledge conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning scenarios.

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReamCamo is a unified out-painting framework for realistic camouflaged image generation that addresses visual similarity and semantic coherence issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged image generation methods have two main problems: 1) insufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity between foreground and background, and 2) cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. These limitations create a substantial gap between generated images and real camouflaged imagery.

Method: ReamCamo uses a unified out-painting based framework with two key innovations: 1) explicit layout controls to regulate global image structure and improve semantic coherence, and 2) multi-modal textual-visual conditions combining fine-grained textual task descriptions with texture-oriented background retrieval to enhance visual fidelity. The framework also introduces a background-foreground distribution divergence metric for quantitative assessment.

Result: Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in generating realistic camouflaged images that better bridge the gap to real camouflaged imagery.

Conclusion: ReamCamo successfully addresses the limitations of existing camouflaged image generation methods by improving both visual similarity and semantic coherence through layout controls and multi-modal conditioning, providing a more effective solution for acquiring training data for camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: PoseStreamer: A robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework using event cameras for high-speed moving objects, featuring temporal consistency, 2D tracking priors, and geometric refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RGB cameras struggle with motion blur in high-speed and low-light scenarios for 6DoF pose estimation. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but current methods have suboptimal performance for high-speed moving objects.

Method: PoseStreamer integrates three components: 1) Adaptive Pose Memory Queue for temporal consistency using historical orientation cues, 2) Object-centric 2D Tracker providing strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and 3) Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays.

Result: Extensive experiments show PoseStreamer achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios and exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects. The paper also introduces MoCapCube6D dataset for benchmarking rapid motion performance.

Conclusion: PoseStreamer addresses the limitations of current 6DoF pose estimation methods in high-speed scenarios by leveraging event cameras and multi-modal integration, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability for novel moving objects.

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

*Linglin Liao,Qichuan Geng,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSA framework enhances medical image segmentation by aligning image regions with hybrid medical texts (locational, descriptive, diagnostic) using symmetric optimal transport and spatial guidance masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided medical image segmentation methods struggle with processing both diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to inaccurate segmentation (e.g., mislocating lesions despite spatial text cues like "in the left lower lung").

Method: Proposes Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework with: 1) symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to establish bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences between image regions and multiple relevant text expressions; 2) composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints by constructing region-level guidance masks.

Result: Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

Conclusion: SSA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enhancing the capacity to process hybrid medical texts with spatial awareness, leading to more accurate medical image segmentation with spatial constraints.

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

TL;DR: Reverse personalization framework for face anonymization using conditional diffusion inversion without text prompts, enabling attribute-controllable identity removal while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods for removing/modifying identity features require subjects to be well-represented in pre-trained models or need model fine-tuning for specific identities, lacking control over facial attributes during anonymization.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion inversion for direct image manipulation without text prompts, incorporates identity-guided conditioning branch to generalize beyond training subjects, and enables attribute-controllable anonymization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality, outperforming prior anonymization methods.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel reverse personalization framework that effectively anonymizes faces while maintaining control over facial attributes and preserving image quality, with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding methods rely on pre-defined Object Lookup Tables (OLTs) to query VLMs, which limits applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets, restricting real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes OpenGround with Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module that progressively augments VLM cognitive scope through human-like perception via cognitive task chains, actively reasoning about contextually relevant objects with dynamically updated OLTs.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers 17.6% improvement on new OpenTarget dataset containing 7000+ object-description pairs for open-world evaluation.

Conclusion: OpenGround enables zero-shot open-world 3D visual grounding by overcoming OLT limitations through active cognition, demonstrating strong performance across both traditional and open-world benchmarks.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

### [174] [With Great Context Comes Great Prediction Power: Classifying Objects via Geo-Semantic Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23024)
*Ciprian Constantinescu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for object classification that uses a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) to incorporate rich scene context, achieving 73.4% accuracy and outperforming context-agnostic and LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use rich contextual information (spatial relationships, material properties, object co-occurrence) for object recognition, while most computational systems operate on isolated image regions, ignoring this vital context.

Method: Constructs a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from monocular images by integrating metric depth estimation with unified panoptic and material segmentation. Objects become nodes with geometric, chromatic, and material attributes; spatial relationships become edges. A specialized graph-based classifier aggregates features from target objects, immediate neighbors, and global scene context.

Result: Achieves 73.4% classification accuracy on COCO 2017, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (38.4%), fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%), and state-of-the-art multimodal LLM Llama 4 Scout (42.3%).

Conclusion: Explicitly structured and interpretable context representation through GSCG significantly improves object recognition, demonstrating the superiority of context-aware approaches over context-agnostic and LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

TL;DR: Analysis of two vision-language models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct) and their application in a video-to-artifact pipeline for person detection with emotion attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural properties of modern VLMs map to practical video analysis pipelines, enabling structured person detection with attributes like emotion, and to clarify system constraints for robust implementation.

Method: Architecture-led analysis of two VLMs, implementation of video pipeline that samples frames, prompts VLMs to detect people with bounding boxes and attributes, validates output structure using predefined schema, and optionally renders annotated videos.

Result: Identified key distinctions: structured outputs can be syntactically valid but semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural not geometric, person identifiers are frame-local, and interactive analysis returns free-form text rather than JSON.

Conclusion: Understanding these architectural mappings and system constraints is critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation in vision-language model applications.

Abstract: This report provides an architecture-led analysis of two modern vision-language models (VLMs), Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and explains how their architectural properties map to a practical video-to-artifact pipeline implemented in the BodyLanguageDetection repository [1]. The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON. These distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation.

TL;DR: Co2S is a stable semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation framework that fuses CLIP and DINOv3 vision foundation models to mitigate pseudo-label drift through heterogeneous dual-student architecture with explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance and global-local feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation suffers from pseudo-label drift where confirmation bias leads to error accumulation during training, limiting its effectiveness in reducing annotation burden.

Method: Proposes Co2S framework with: 1) Heterogeneous dual-student architecture using ViT-based models initialized with CLIP and DINOv3; 2) Explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism using text embeddings (explicit) and learnable queries (implicit); 3) Global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy to combine CLIP's global context with DINOv3's local details.

Result: Extensive experiments on six popular datasets show superior performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios, achieving leading segmentation results.

Conclusion: Co2S effectively addresses pseudo-label drift in semi-supervised remote sensing segmentation by synergistically fusing vision-language and self-supervised model priors through innovative architectural and guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: LAM3C learns 3D representations from unlabeled videos without real 3D sensors, using a novel self-supervised framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale 3D scene scans is expensive and labor-intensive, so the paper investigates whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors.

Method: Proposes LAM3C framework with RoomTours dataset (49,219 scenes from web videos), noise-regularized loss for geometric smoothness, and multi-level 3D clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.

Result: Without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive 3D scanning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

### [178] [Video-BrowseComp: Benchmarking Agentic Video Research on Open Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23044)
*Zhengyang Liang,Yan Shu,Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Kaixin Liang,Paolo Rota,Nicu Sebe,Zheng Liu,Lizi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-BrowseComp is a new benchmark for agentic video reasoning that requires actively navigating video timelines and cross-referencing evidence from the open web, unlike existing passive video perception benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video benchmarks focus on passive perception of curated clips, failing to evaluate the proactive research capabilities needed for real-world web video analysis where agents must actively interrogate video timelines and verify claims against open web sources.

Method: Created Video-BrowseComp benchmark with 210 questions that enforce mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, requiring navigation of video timelines to verify external claims rather than relying on text search alone.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly (GPT-5.1 with Search achieves only 15.24% accuracy), revealing they rely on textual proxies and fail in metadata-sparse domains like sports and gameplay where visual grounding is essential.

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive video perception toward proactive video reasoning, highlighting critical bottlenecks in current models' ability to perform agentic video research on the open web.

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

### [179] [MedSAM-based lung masking for multi-label chest X-ray classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23089)
*Brayden Miao,Zain Rehman,Xin Miao,Siming Liu,Jianjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Segmentation-guided CXR classification using MedSAM for lung extraction improves normal case screening but shows trade-offs with abnormality-specific classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated CXR interpretation faces challenges due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models like MedSAM offer anatomically grounded priors to improve robustness and interpretability.

Method: Fine-tuned MedSAM for lung region extraction, applied to NIH CXR dataset. Trained deep CNNs for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, Fibrosis) with normal case evaluation via derived score. Compared original images, loose masking, and tight masking approaches.

Result: MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse conditions. Masking effects are task/architecture-dependent: ResNet50 on original images best for abnormality discrimination; loose masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination; tight masking reduces abnormality performance but improves training efficiency.

Conclusion: Lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match backbone architecture and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly. Loose masking preserves perihilar/peripheral context and partially mitigates performance degradation from tight masking.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

### [180] [PathoSyn: Imaging-Pathology MRI Synthesis via Disentangled Deviation Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23130)
*Jian Wang,Sixing Rong,Jiarui Xing,Yuling Xu,Weide Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathoSyn is a unified generative framework for MRI image synthesis that disentangles anatomy from pathology using deviation-space diffusion modeling, preserving structural integrity while generating realistic pathological variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for MRI synthesis suffer from feature entanglement when operating in global pixel domains or using binary masks, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates and structural discontinuities. There's a need for a method that can generate high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets while preserving anatomical integrity.

Method: PathoSyn decomposes synthesis into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. It uses a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model to learn conditional distributions of pathological residuals, capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structure. The framework includes seam-aware fusion and inference-time stabilization modules to suppress boundary artifacts and ensure spatial coherence.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks show PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The framework generates high-fidelity synthetic datasets with interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling.

Conclusion: PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating patient-specific synthetic MRI data, facilitating robust diagnostic algorithm development in low-data regimes. It supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems.

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

### [181] [Domain-Shift Immunity in Deep Deformable Registration via Local Feature Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23142)
*Mingzhen Shao,Sarang Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep deformable registration models are inherently robust to domain shift due to their reliance on local features, not global appearance. The proposed UniReg framework demonstrates this by achieving cross-domain performance comparable to optimization-based methods despite single-dataset training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep learning has improved deformable image registration, there's a widespread belief that learning-based models are sensitive to domain shift. Current approaches try to address this through large diverse datasets without understanding the underlying mechanisms. The authors aim to investigate whether domain-shift immunity is actually an inherent property of these models.

Method: The authors introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation. It uses fixed, pre-trained feature extractors combined with a UNet-based deformation network. This design isolates the role of local feature representations. The framework is trained on only a single dataset but tested across domains and modalities.

Result: UniReg demonstrates robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods despite being trained on a single dataset. Analysis reveals that failures in conventional CNN-based models under modality shift come from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers, not from the registration mechanism itself.

Conclusion: Domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models due to their reliance on local feature representations. Local feature consistency is the key driver of robustness, motivating backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features rather than relying on large diverse training datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

*Jingyu Li,Xiaolong Zhao,Zhe Liu,Wenxiao Wu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoTeacher enhances semi-supervised 3D object detection by improving geometric relation understanding through keypoint-based supervision and voxel-wise augmentation with distance-decay mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous semi-supervised 3D object detection methods overlook that models with limited labeled data exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries, which is crucial for object perception and localization. The paper aims to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data.

Method: 1) Keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to student. 2) Voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases diversity of object geometries with distance-decay mechanism to preserve integrity of distant objects. 3) Framework can be combined with different SS3D methods.

Result: Extensive experiments on ONCE and Waymo datasets show effectiveness and generalization of the method, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The approach can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance.

Conclusion: GeoTeacher successfully enhances student model's ability to capture geometric relations in semi-supervised 3D object detection through geometric supervision and augmentation strategies, demonstrating strong performance and generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: REVEALER is a unified framework for fine-grained element-level alignment evaluation between text prompts and generated images using reinforcement-guided visual reasoning with MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for text-to-image alignment rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines that lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences.

Method: Adopts a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm using MLLMs to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. Optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a composite reward function incorporating structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench), consistently outperforming both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

Conclusion: REVEALER provides a unified, interpretable framework for fine-grained element-level alignment evaluation that better reflects human preferences and offers improved performance and efficiency over existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

*Yi Zhang,Yi Wang,Lei Yao,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GVSynergy-Det is a novel image-based 3D object detection framework that synergistically combines Gaussian and voxel representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance without requiring depth sensors or dense 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based 3D detection faces a trade-off: methods with high accuracy need dense 3D supervision, while unsupervised methods struggle to extract accurate geometry from RGB images alone. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging complementary geometric representations.

Method: The framework uses a dual-representation architecture: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract fine-grained surface details, 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields, and 3) uses learnable integration to directly leverage features from both representations.

Result: GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks (ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes), significantly outperforming existing methods without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (point clouds or TSDF).

Conclusion: The synergistic combination of continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations enables accurate 3D object detection from RGB images alone, overcoming the limitations of previous methods that either required dense supervision or struggled with geometry extraction.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Driving World Model framework using 3D Gaussian scene representation that enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation with early modality alignment between text and 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Driving World Models lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and cannot properly align textual information with 3D scenes. Current approaches using point clouds or BEV features fail to achieve accurate text-3D alignment.

Method: Proposes a unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation with: 1) linguistic features embedded into Gaussian primitives for early modality alignment, 2) task-aware language-guided sampling to remove redundant Gaussians and inject compact 3D tokens into LLM, and 3) dual-condition multi-modal generation using both high-level language conditions and low-level image conditions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and NuInteract datasets, validating the effectiveness of the framework for 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D Gaussian-based DWM framework successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling proper 3D scene understanding, achieving early text-3D alignment, and supporting both understanding and generation tasks through a unified architecture.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using Unreal Engine to generate synthetic RGB data for military target detection, enabling cross-domain adaptation from synthetic to real military domains where real data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Military object detection faces challenges with domain adaptation across varied environments, high costs of SAR data, and lack of military target datasets. RGB cameras offer affordable alternatives but need synthetic data generation.

Method: Generate synthetic RGB data using Unreal Engine photorealistic tool, create synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training on synthetic data and validating on web-collected real military datasets. Benchmark state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods with varying supervision levels.

Result: Methods using minimal image hints (e.g., object class) achieve substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. Identifies remaining challenges in cross-domain military target detection.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation via Unreal Engine is promising for military target detection, but current domain adaptation methods still face challenges in handling cross-domain military scenarios, highlighting need for further research.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to adaptively select and consolidate diffusion timestep features for few-shot dense prediction tasks, addressing the sub-optimal heuristic selection of timesteps in current diffusion model applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features for single-task prediction, which relies on empirical intuition and leads to sub-optimal performance biased toward certain tasks. The authors aim to investigate versatile diffusion timestep features for few-shot dense prediction.

Method: Proposes two modules: 1) Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and 2) Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate selected timestep features. Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter for few-shot dense prediction.

Result: Empirically validated on large-scale Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, achieving superiority in dense prediction performance with only a few support queries in practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed learnable timestep consolidation method effectively addresses the limitations of heuristic timestep selection in diffusion models, enabling better few-shot dense prediction performance through adaptive timestep feature selection and consolidation.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: AVOID dataset for real-time obstacle detection under adverse conditions with semantic/depth maps, LiDAR data, and waypoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable detection of small road hazards in real-time under varying adverse conditions (weather, daylight), which existing datasets lack due to domain gaps between normal/adverse scenarios and missing obstacle data in same visual domain.

Method: Introduce AVOID dataset collected in simulated environment with unexpected road obstacles under various weather/time conditions, coupled with semantic/depth maps, raw/semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints.

Result: Benchmark results on high-performing real-time networks for obstacle detection, plus ablation studies using comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction.

Conclusion: AVOID dataset addresses limitations of existing road driving datasets by providing comprehensive adverse-condition data with multiple sensor modalities to support various visual perception tasks for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

TL;DR: MM-UAVBench: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-altitude UAV scenarios across perception, cognition, and planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks don't adequately cover low-altitude UAV scenarios, and existing UAV evaluations focus on specific tasks rather than assessing MLLMs' general intelligence in these complex environments.

Method: Created MM-UAVBench with 19 sub-tasks and over 5.7K manually annotated questions derived from real-world UAV data from public datasets. Evaluated 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs across three core capability dimensions.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle to adapt to complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Analysis revealed critical bottlenecks including spatial bias and multi-view understanding issues.

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench fills an important gap in evaluating MLLMs for UAV applications and will help foster research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

*Youngchae Kwon,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

TL;DR: Holi-DETR: A transformer-based fashion item detector that uses holistic contextual information (co-occurrence, spatial arrangements, body keypoints) to reduce ambiguities in fashion item detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion item detection is challenging due to diverse appearances and similarities between subcategories. Conventional detectors treat items independently, missing important contextual relationships that could help resolve ambiguities.

Method: Proposes Holi-DETR, a novel Detection Transformer architecture that integrates three types of contextual information: (1) co-occurrence relationships between fashion items, (2) relative position/size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) spatial relationships between items and human body keypoints.

Result: Improved performance over vanilla DETR by 3.6 percentage points (pp) and over Co-DETR by 1.1 pp in terms of average precision (AP).

Conclusion: Holistic detection leveraging contextual information significantly improves fashion item detection performance by reducing ambiguities that arise from diverse appearances and similar subcategories.

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMAGE is a unified director model that combines script drafting and key-shot design in a single framework using Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and a novel "first interleaving, then disentangling" training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI video creation systems treat script drafting (using LLMs) and key-shot design (using image generation models) as separate tasks, but these should be unified since both logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are essential for film direction.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Transformers architecture to unify text and image generation. Introduces "first interleaving, then disentangling" training: 1) Interleaved Concept Learning with text-image data for script understanding, 2) Disentangled Expert Learning to decouple script writing from keyframe generation for flexibility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images, enabling non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films.

Conclusion: UniMAGE successfully bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts in a unified framework, demonstrating that combining logical reasoning and imaginative thinking in a single model enables better AI-driven video creation.

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

TL;DR: Proposes a framework using pre-trained text-guided image translation and image retrieval to efficiently generate realistic synthetic defect images for anomaly detection, combined with a two-stage training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in manufacturing suffers from scarcity of real defect images. Existing synthesis methods present a trade-off: rule-based methods are cheap but unrealistic, while generative models are high-quality but expensive. Need a cost-effective way to generate realistic synthetic defects.

Method: Uses pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model to generate defect images, combined with image retrieval model to filter irrelevant outputs by assessing similarity to real normal images. Also introduces two-stage training: pre-training on large volume of rule-based synthetic images, then fine-tuning on smaller set of high-quality generated images.

Result: Experiments on MVTec AD dataset demonstrate effectiveness of the approach, significantly reducing data collection costs while improving anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently generates high-quality synthetic defect images by leveraging pre-trained models and retrieval-based filtering, enabling cost-effective anomaly detection training with improved performance.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: SGPS uses SURE gradient updates and PCA noise estimation to correct diffusion sampling trajectory deviations, enabling high-quality inverse problem reconstruction with <100 NFEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based inverse problem solving methods require hundreds/thousands of steps due to error accumulation from alternating diffusion sampling and data consistency steps.

Method: SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS) corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA-based noise estimation, mitigating noise-induced errors in early/middle sampling stages.

Result: SGPS maintains high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) and consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts across diverse inverse problems.

Conclusion: SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling with reduced error accumulation, achieving efficient high-quality reconstruction for inverse problems using diffusion priors.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEG-DRNet: A physics-edge hybrid network for infrared gas leak detection that combines gas transport modeling with edge-aware feature routing to detect faint, small, semitransparent plumes with weak boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared gas leak detection is challenging due to plumes being faint, small, semitransparent, and having weak, diffuse boundaries. Existing methods struggle with these characteristics, requiring improved detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Three key components: 1) Gas Block with diffusion-convection modeling using local and large-kernel branches with edge-gated fusion; 2) AGPEO edge operator for reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase consistency; 3) CASR-PAN with adaptive information modulation for selective feature propagation across scales based on edge and content cues.

Result: Achieves 29.8% overall AP, 84.3% AP50, and 25.3% small-object AP on IIG dataset, surpassing RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0%, 6.5%, and 5.3% respectively. Requires only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9M parameters, showing best balance of accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: PEG-DRNet achieves superior performance with the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors on IIG and LangGas datasets through its physics-edge hybrid approach to infrared gas leak detection.

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free two-stage data pruning method for remote sensing diffusion foundation models that selects high-quality subsets under high pruning ratios, improving convergence and generation quality while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing diffusion foundation models rely on large datasets with redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, which reduce training efficiency and prevent convergence. Current approaches either aggregate multiple datasets or use simplistic deduplication, ignoring generation modeling requirements and RS imagery heterogeneity.

Method: Two-stage data pruning approach: 1) Entropy-based criterion removes low-information samples, 2) Scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling using RS scene classification datasets as reference, balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness for fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios.

Result: Method significantly improves convergence and generation quality even after pruning 85% of training data. Diffusion foundation models trained with this approach achieve state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks like super-resolution and semantic image synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed data pruning paradigm provides practical guidance for developing efficient remote sensing generative foundation models by selecting high-quality subsets that preserve diversity and representativeness while enabling rapid convergence.

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

Method: Vision-language Model framework with two innovations: 1) Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) using coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources; 2) Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM) with three-tier alignment covering object, local-region, and global levels.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency on RS-GPT4V dataset. Achieves superior performance in BLEU-4, CIDEr for image captioning, and R@10 for cross-modal retrieval compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Provides novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for intelligent remote sensing interpretation engineering applications.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional remote sensing change detection methods inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Recent multimodal/VLM approaches still suffer from inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise boundary delineation, and limited interpretability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) - VLM fine-tuned via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking image patches and outputting coarse change masks; 2) Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD) - integrates dual-temporal image features with coarse mask to predict precise binary change maps.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks show ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1 effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by combining VLM-based semantic reasoning with precise mask-guided decoding, resulting in superior performance for remote sensing change detection tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating sequences of images while preserving consistent character identity across different scene descriptions, facing a trade-off between identity consistency and prompt alignment.

Method: 1) Selective text embedding modification for explicit semantic control over character identity; 2) Semantic control strategy repurposing padding embeddings as semantic containers in FLUX; 3) Adaptive feature-sharing strategy that evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to ambiguous identity prompts.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs between identity consistency and prompt alignment.

Conclusion: ASemconsist successfully addresses the challenge of consistent character identity generation across diverse scenes while maintaining prompt alignment, with the proposed Consistency Quality Score providing a comprehensive evaluation metric.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

TL;DR: Contour-aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that uses object segmentation priors to preserve edge structures and prevent blurry boundaries, especially effective with few Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D Gaussian Splatting methods produce blurry/indistinct boundaries when using few Gaussians due to lack of contour awareness, limiting their effectiveness in high compression scenarios.

Method: Proposes Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting that incorporates object segmentation priors, constrains each Gaussian to specific segmentation regions during rasterization to prevent cross-boundary blending, and includes a warm-up scheme for training stability.

Result: Achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods, particularly evident with very few Gaussians, while maintaining fast rendering and low memory usage on synthetic color charts and DAVIS dataset.

Conclusion: The contour-aware approach effectively addresses the boundary blurring problem in 2D Gaussian Splatting, enabling better edge preservation under high compression while retaining the efficiency advantages of Gaussian-based representations.

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEM is a fidelity-optimization plugin that uses cumulative error minimization to dynamically optimize caching strategies for Diffusion Transformers, improving generation fidelity without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have slow inference due to iterative denoising. Existing caching-based acceleration methods suffer from computational errors that limit fidelity, and their fixed caching strategies can't adapt to complex error variations during denoising.

Method: Proposes CEM (cumulative error minimization) that predefines error to characterize model sensitivity to acceleration based on timesteps and cache intervals. Uses dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation to optimize caching strategies, minimizing caching error.

Result: CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models across 9 generation models and quantized methods in 3 tasks. Outperforms original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-α, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan.

Conclusion: CEM is a model-agnostic, training-free plugin that optimizes caching strategies via cumulative error minimization, improving diffusion model acceleration fidelity without additional computational overhead, with strong generalization across models and tasks.

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

*Xu Lin,Jinlong Peng,Zhenye Gan,Jiawen Zhu,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-Master introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for real-time object detection using Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts to dynamically allocate computational resources based on scene complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing YOLO-like RTOD methods use static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, leading to computational redundancy (over-allocating on trivial scenes) and suboptimal performance (under-serving complex scenes).

Method: Proposes YOLO-Master framework with Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources per input based on scene complexity. Uses lightweight dynamic routing network with diversity-enhancing objective to encourage complementary expertise among experts, activating only relevant experts during inference.

Result: Achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency on MS COCO, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP with 17.8% faster inference. Gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes while maintaining efficiency on typical inputs and real-time inference speed.

Conclusion: YOLO-Master successfully addresses the computational mismatch in RTOD by introducing adaptive computation, achieving superior accuracy-speed trade-off, especially for complex scenes, while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

TL;DR: Multimodal frameworks for micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction using RGB video and skeletal pose data, achieving 2nd place in MiGA 2025 Challenge emotion prediction task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are challenging tasks requiring modeling of subtle, fine-grained human behaviors from video and skeletal pose data, with applications in understanding nuanced human expressions.

Method: Two multimodal frameworks: 1) For micro-gesture classification, uses MViTv2-S for video embeddings and 2s-AGCN for skeletal embeddings, integrated via Cross-Modal Token Fusion module. 2) For emotion recognition, uses SwinFace for facial embeddings and MViTv2-S for contextual embeddings, fused via InterFusion module.

Result: Experiments on iMiGUE dataset within MiGA 2025 Challenge demonstrated robust performance, with the approach securing 2nd place in the behavior-based emotion prediction task.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal frameworks effectively capture complementary information from different modalities (RGB, pose, facial, contextual) for fine-grained behavior analysis, showing strong performance in challenging micro-gesture and emotion recognition tasks.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are both highly challenging tasks that require modeling subtle, fine-grained human behaviors, primarily leveraging video and skeletal pose data. In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

TL;DR: CME-CAD is a novel training paradigm using heterogeneous collaborative multi-expert reinforcement learning to generate high-precision, editable CAD models from sketches, addressing limitations of existing methods that produce non-editable approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD modeling is complex and hard to automate. Existing methods produce non-editable, approximate models that don't meet industrial precision requirements. Text/image-based inputs require manual annotation, limiting scalability in industrial settings.

Method: Proposes Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm with two-stage training: 1) Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and 2) Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Integrates complementary strengths of different models for collaborative learning.

Result: Introduces CADExpert benchmark with 17,299 instances including orthographic projections with dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

Conclusion: The CME-CAD paradigm improves generation of accurate, constraint-compatible, fully editable CAD models by facilitating collaborative learning between heterogeneous models, addressing key challenges in industrial CAD automation.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

### [206] [Visual Language Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23335)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual representation learning requires semantic language with discrete states, implying fiber bundle structure where nuisance variation is in fibers and semantics in quotient base space. Semantic invariance needs discriminative targets (labels, identification, multimodal alignment), and architecture must support topology change via expand-and-snap process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand visual representation learning from structural/topological perspective, starting from hypothesis that visual understanding requires semantic language where many perceptual observations map to few discrete semantic states. This provides theoretical foundation for why certain learning approaches work.

Method: Theoretical analysis using topological/geometric framework. Derives implications from fiber bundle structure hypothesis: visual observation space organized as fiber bundle (nuisance variation in fibers, semantics in quotient base space). Analyzes requirements for semantic invariance and model architecture.

Result: Two key theoretical consequences: 1) Semantic quotient X/G is not submanifold of X and requires discriminative targets (supervision via labels, cross-instance identification, multimodal alignment) for semantic invariance. 2) Model architecture must support topology change via "expand-and-snap" process (geometric expansion then collapse to discrete semantic regions).

Conclusion: The framework provides topological interpretation aligning with empirical regularities in large-scale discriminative/multimodal models and classical statistical learning principles. Results are interpretive rather than prescriptive, offering theoretical lens for understanding why certain representation learning approaches succeed.

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

### [207] [CountGD++: Generalized Prompting for Open-World Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23351)
*Niki Amini-Naieni,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountGD++ introduces novel prompt flexibility for object counting by allowing specification of what NOT to count, automating visual example annotation with pseudo-exemplars, and accepting both natural/synthetic external images as examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counting methods have limited flexibility in specifying target objects - they require manual annotation of visual examples and cannot specify what objects to exclude from counting, restricting their practical utility.

Method: Extends counting prompts to include negative specifications (what not to count) via text/visual examples, introduces pseudo-exemplars for automated annotation at inference, and enables models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images.

Result: Significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets, with CountGD++ serving as a vision expert agent for LLMs in multi-modal open-world counting tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed contributions expand prompt flexibility for object counting, addressing key limitations of existing methods and enabling more practical, accurate counting applications with reduced manual annotation requirements.

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialMosaic: A scalable multi-view data generation pipeline creates 2M QA pairs for 3D spatial reasoning, plus a 1M QA benchmark and hybrid VLM framework with 3D geometry encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs for 3D scene understanding rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or reconstruction pipelines, limiting scalability and real-world applicability. Current approaches don't adequately address real-world challenges like partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions requiring spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues.

Method: 1) Scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline to construct realistic spatial reasoning QA pairs (SpatialMosaic dataset with 2M QA pairs). 2) SpatialMosaic-Bench benchmark with 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning. 3) SpatialMosaicVLM framework integrating 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within Vision-Language Models.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions. The data generation pipeline successfully constructs realistic and diverse QA pairs for training and evaluation.

Conclusion: The work addresses key limitations in 3D spatial reasoning by providing scalable data generation, comprehensive benchmarks, and a hybrid framework that integrates 3D geometry encoders with VLMs, enabling robust spatial reasoning from multi-view images without explicit 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs. Code and dataset will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-view correspondence learning methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, making it difficult to accurately capture geometric constraints and reducing model robustness.

Method: Proposes Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net) with two modules: Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) that dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via adaptive attention, and Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) that establishes geometric consensus via cross-stage sparse graph network.

Result: Experimental results on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Conclusion: MGCA-Net effectively addresses limitations in geometric modeling and cross-stage optimization for two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating superior performance on key vision tasks.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeXT-IMDL is a diagnostic benchmark that exposes the fragility of current image manipulation detection models by systematically testing their generalization across four fundamental axes of AI-generated content, revealing significant performance degradation in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accessibility and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models create an urgent need for robust image manipulation detection methods. Current cross-dataset evaluation approaches conceal the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress.

Method: NeXT-IMDL is a large-scale diagnostic benchmark that categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. It implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols to systematically probe generalization boundaries.

Result: Experiments on 11 representative models reveal that while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper provides a diagnostic toolkit and new findings to advance the development of truly robust, next-generation image manipulation detection and localization models by exposing the limitations of current approaches and establishing more realistic evaluation standards.

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

TL;DR: 14B-parameter framework for real-time audio-driven avatar generation with sub-second latency and 32 FPS throughput using bidirectional attention and self-correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for real-time audio-driven avatar generation compromise visual fidelity due to computational load vs. latency constraints, often using unidirectional attention or reduced model capacity.

Method: Introduces SoulX-LiveTalk with Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation (retains bidirectional attention within video chunks), Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism (prevents error accumulation), and full-stack inference acceleration suite with hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations.

Result: Achieves sub-second start-up latency (0.87s) and real-time throughput of 32 FPS, setting new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis at 14B scale.

Conclusion: SoulX-LiveTalk successfully addresses the engineering challenge of real-time, infinite-duration audio-driven avatar generation by balancing computational efficiency with visual fidelity through innovative bidirectional attention retention and self-correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

*Xiaolan Li,Wanquan Liu,Pengcheng Li,Pengyu Jie,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFTooth: A 2D-3D fusion framework for 3D tooth instance segmentation that leverages frozen 2D SAM embeddings without 2D mask supervision, addressing challenges like boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D tooth segmentation faces challenges from crowded arches, ambiguous boundaries, missing teeth, and rare third molars. Native 3D methods suffer from boundary leakage and center drift, while 2D foundation models like SAM provide strong semantics but are impractical for direct 3D clinical workflows.

Method: SOFTooth uses semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion: 1) Point-wise residual gating injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine boundaries, 2) Center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between masks and centroids, 3) Order-aware Hungarian matching integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance for coherent labeling.

Result: On 3DTeethSeg'22 dataset, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating effective transfer of 2D semantics to 3D segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Rich 2D semantics from foundation models can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation through the proposed fusion framework, addressing key challenges in dental segmentation without requiring 2D mask supervision or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ArtQuant: A novel aesthetic assessment framework using large-scale RAD dataset and LLM decoders to bridge the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aesthetic quality assessment faces two key challenges: (1) data scarcity and imbalance - existing datasets focus too much on visual perception while neglecting deeper cognitive/emotional dimensions due to expensive manual annotation, and (2) model fragmentation - current methods either isolate aesthetic attributes or struggle with long-form textual descriptions.

Method: Proposes two solutions: (1) RAD dataset - a large-scale (70k) multi-dimensional structured dataset generated via iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs, and (2) ArtQuant framework - couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation and better models long-text semantics using LLM decoders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. Theoretical analysis confirms the symbiosis between RAD's semantic adequacy and generation paradigm minimizes prediction entropy.

Conclusion: The proposed ArtQuant framework with RAD dataset effectively addresses fundamental challenges in aesthetic assessment by providing scalable data generation and better modeling of complex aesthetic dimensions through LLM integration, advancing human-aligned quantitative evaluation for AIGC.

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

TL;DR: DriveLaW unifies video generation and motion planning for autonomous driving by directly injecting video generator latents into the planner, achieving state-of-the-art results in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models for autonomous driving keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes, limiting their effectiveness. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating a truly unified approach.

Method: DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video (world model for high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations) and DriveLaW-Act (diffusion planner that generates trajectories from DriveLaW-Video's latents). Both components are optimized using a three-stage progressive training strategy.

Result: DriveLaW achieves new state-of-the-art results: 33.3% improvement in FID and 1.8% improvement in FVD for video prediction, and sets a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

Conclusion: The unified paradigm of DriveLaW successfully bridges the gap between world prediction and motion planning, demonstrating that inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning leads to superior performance in autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

*Dohyun Kim,Seungwoo Lyu,Seung Wook Kim,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDSPO is a new preference optimization method for diffusion models that provides per-timestep supervision from winning/losing policies, using automatically generated preference signals from pretrained models instead of costly human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with aligning outputs to nuanced user intent and maintaining consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based methods like DDPO rely on expensive, noisy human-labeled datasets, creating a need for more efficient supervision methods.

Method: DDSPO directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when available. It avoids labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model - contrasting outputs conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants.

Result: DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision. It provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory.

Conclusion: DDSPO enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations, offering a practical strategy for improving diffusion model alignment and quality with reduced supervision costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models tend to produce hallucinated content inconsistent with visual inputs, limiting their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of images, transforms them into synthetic images using text-to-image models, and uses Wasserstein-based fusion to align predictive distributions into consistent decoding trajectories.

Result: Substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations across six hallucination-focused benchmarks, outperforming existing decoding strategies.

Conclusion: CoFi-Dec is an effective, model-agnostic framework that requires no additional training and can be seamlessly applied to various LVLMs to improve visual grounding and reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic I2I translation needs consistent, predictable outputs that closely match ground truth with high fidelity, addressing limitations of stochastic approaches.

Method: Proposes a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual neural network approximators - one for forward process and one for reverse process - to exploit Brownian bridge dynamics for faithful I2I translation.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superior performance in image quality and faithfulness to ground truth compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Conclusion: Dual-approx Bridge achieves consistent, high-quality deterministic I2I translation with negligible variance, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Conclusion: MCI-Net effectively addresses limitations of Euclidean neighborhood-based approaches by integrating multi-domain contextual cues, leading to robust and discriminative feature learning for high-quality point cloud registration.

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

Motivation: Standard CNN backbones for two-view correspondence learning often fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity, limiting their performance in challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposes SC-Net with three key modules: 1) Adaptive Focused Regularization (AFR) for position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion, 2) Bilateral Field Adjustment (BFA) to refine motion fields by modeling long-range relationships across spatial/channel dimensions, and 3) Position-Aware Recovery (PAR) to extract motion vectors with consistency and precision.

Result: Extensive experiments show SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

Conclusion: SC-Net effectively addresses CNN limitations in two-view correspondence learning by integrating bilateral context, demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios with large disparity.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Video Language Models struggle with long videos due to narrow temporal windows and inability to detect fine-grained semantic shifts over extended durations. Existing text-based retrieval pipelines ignore temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels.

Method: TV-RAG introduces two main mechanisms: 1) a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into similarity computation to rank text queries by their true multimedia context, and 2) an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames to reduce redundancy while preserving representativeness.

Result: The system consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: TV-RAG provides a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path for any LVLM without requiring re-training or fine-tuning, offering improved long-video reasoning through temporal and semantic signal integration.

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

Motivation: Current context modeling approaches focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects, which limits complex scene understanding.

Method: Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN) hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in high-dimensional Hilbert space, combining random walks with attention mechanism to learn multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale, with cascaded modules that select salient anchors and dynamically fuse neighborhood features via attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks show PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: PanCAN significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features, substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

Current inference-time scaling approaches are suboptimal - reward-driven optimization causes perceptual over-smoothing while optimal-path search loses structural consistency.

Method: IAFS (Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering) uses iterative refinement to correct structural deviations and adaptive frequency fusion to integrate high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information. It's a training-free framework that progressively refines generated images.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Conclusion: IAFS provides an effective solution to the trade-off between perceptual quality and structural fidelity in diffusion-based super-resolution through iterative refinement and adaptive frequency steering, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyMS is a training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization that balances text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject customization methods struggle to balance text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while requiring additional training that limits scalability and efficiency.

Method: AnyMS uses a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism: global decoupling separates text-visual attention for text alignment, and local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area to prevent conflicts. It employs pre-trained image adapters for feature extraction without subject learning.

Result: AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supports complex compositions, and scales to larger numbers of subjects while maintaining training-free operation.

Conclusion: AnyMS provides an effective training-free solution for layout-guided multi-subject customization that successfully balances the three critical objectives while offering scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

*Shengyi Hua,Jianfeng Wu,Tianle Shen,Kangzhe Hu,Zhongzhen Huang,Shujuan Ni,Zhihong Zhang,Yuan Li,Zhe Wang,Xiaofan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathFound is an agentic multimodal model for pathology that mimics clinical diagnostic workflows by actively seeking evidence through multiple stages, improving diagnostic accuracy over static inference models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models use static inference where whole-slide images are processed once without reassessment, unlike clinical workflows where pathologists refine diagnoses through repeated observations and targeted evidence acquisition.

Method: PathFound integrates pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning. It operates through three stages: initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision, enabling proactive information acquisition.

Result: The evidence-seeking strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy across multiple large multimodal models. PathFound achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong ability to discover subtle pathological features like nuclear characteristics and local invasions.

Conclusion: Evidence-seeking workflows are effective in computational pathology, and PathFound's agentic approach represents a significant advancement over static inference paradigms, better aligning with clinical diagnostic practices.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Jun Xie,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PurifyGen is a training-free, plug-and-play method for safe text-to-image generation that purifies risky prompts through dual-space transformation without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety methods for diffusion models (text blacklisting, harmful content classification) are easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and retraining. There's a need for more robust, training-free approaches that preserve model capabilities while preventing unsafe content generation.

Method: Dual-stage prompt purification: 1) Token safety evaluation using complementary semantic distance to measure proximity to toxic vs. clean concept embeddings; 2) For risky prompts, dual-space transformation projects toxic-aligned embeddings into null space of toxic concepts (removing harmful semantics) while aligning them into range space of clean concepts (reinforcing safe semantics). Uses token-wise selective replacement to minimize disruption to safe content.

Result: PurifyGen outperforms current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches. It demonstrates strong generalization to unseen prompts and models while maintaining original intent and coherence.

Conclusion: PurifyGen provides an effective, theoretically-grounded, plug-and-play solution for safe text-to-image generation that doesn't require model retraining, offering better safety than existing methods while preserving model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

TL;DR: RxnBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs, revealing significant gaps in models' ability to comprehend chemical logic and integrate information across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show promise for revolutionizing chemistry but their ability to understand the dense graphical language of chemical reactions in real scientific literature remains underexplored and needs rigorous evaluation.

Method: Created RxnBench with two tasks: Single-Figure QA (1,525 questions from 305 reaction schemes) testing visual perception and mechanistic reasoning, and Full-Document QA (108 articles) requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables.

Result: MLLMs excel at extracting explicit text but struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Models with inference-time reasoning outperform standard architectures, but none achieve 50% accuracy on Full-Document QA.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists, as current MLLMs have critical capability gaps in chemical reaction understanding.

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While CoT reasoning has shown success in multimodal understanding tasks, its extension to generation tasks remains limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation.

Method: ThinkGen uses a decoupled architecture with a pretrained MLLM and Diffusion Transformer (DiT), where MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent and DiT produces images guided by these instructions. It employs separable GRPO-based training that alternates reinforcement learning between MLLM and DiT modules.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThinkGen successfully extends CoT reasoning to generation tasks through a flexible framework that enables joint training across diverse datasets and facilitates effective reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of imaging devices and massive daily image generation creates high demand for efficient and effective denoising methods that balance speed and performance.

Method: Establishes theoretical connection between PCA and Haar transform under circulant representation, proposes Haar-tSVD using unified tensor SVD projection with Haar transform to capture global/local correlations, includes adaptive noise estimation via eigenvalue analysis, and integrates deep neural networks for severe noise conditions.

Result: Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for noise removal.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD provides a computationally simple, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that balances denoising speed and performance without needing to learn local bases.

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGuard is a vision-language proactive guard system that identifies and describes out-of-distribution safety risks in multimodal content without requiring model adjustments, outperforming existing methods on risk detection and description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for multimodal safety risks are limited and reactive, requiring model adjustments. The rapid evolution of generative models continuously exposes new safety risks that current approaches cannot effectively handle.

Method: 1) Construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples with binary safety labels and hierarchical risk categories; 2) Train vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning; 3) Introduce OOD safety category inference task; 4) Augment RL objective with synonym-bank-based similarity reward for concise description generation.

Result: ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization, and improves OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Conclusion: ProGuard provides an effective proactive safety guard for multimodal content that can identify and describe unseen safety risks without model adjustments, addressing limitations of traditional reactive approaches and demonstrating strong performance across multiple safety tasks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

*Ethan Chern,Zhulin Hu,Bohao Tang,Jiadi Su,Steffi Chern,Zhijie Deng,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time interactive video diffusion via improved distillation for multimodal conditioning (text, image, audio), achieving 20x faster inference with quality preservation, enabling seamless human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for video generation are too slow for real-time interaction due to bidirectional attention and iterative denoising. Existing distillation methods focus on text-to-video and don't handle multimodal conditioning well, leading to unnatural human-AI interaction.

Method: Improved distillation recipe addressing challenges of Self Forcing approach, focusing on quality of condition inputs, initialization, and schedule for on-policy optimization. Integrated with audio language models and Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks technique for long-form video inference.

Result: Distilled model matches visual quality of full-step bidirectional baselines with 20x less inference cost/latency on HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ benchmarks. LiveTalk system outperforms Sora2 and Veo3 in multi-turn coherence and content quality while reducing latency from 1-2 minutes to real-time.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time multimodal interactive avatar systems, bridging the gap for seamless human-AI interaction by solving quality degradation issues in distillation and achieving practical real-time performance.

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

TL;DR: TWIN introduces a large-scale dataset of 561K image-pair queries to enhance VLMs' fine-grained perceptual abilities by training models to distinguish visually similar objects, improving performance on fine-grained recognition tasks without harming general VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details due to training corpora that emphasize general recognition over fine-grained perception.

Method: Created TWIN dataset with 561,000 image-pair queries requiring models to determine if two visually similar images show the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. Also introduced FGVQA benchmark suite of 12,000 queries from multiple fine-grained domains to evaluate improvements.

Result: VLMs fine-tuned on TWIN show up to 19.3% improvement on the FGVQA benchmark, with gains extending to unseen domains like art, animals, plants, and landmarks, while maintaining performance on general VQA benchmarks. Dataset scales favorably with object annotations.

Conclusion: TWIN dataset effectively enhances VLMs' fine-grained perceptual abilities and can be integrated as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora to advance perceptual precision in future models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fire detection models (YOLOv7, RT-DETR, YOLOv9) have limitations in night vision scenarios, particularly misclassifying bright artificial lights as fire and struggling with small/distant objects in RGB images.

Method: Three contributions: 1) Enhanced NIR dataset with data augmentation, 2) Two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 for detection and EfficientNetV2-B0 for classification to reduce false positives, 3) Patched-YOLO for improved small/distant object detection in RGB images through patch-based processing.

Result: The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods (YOLOv7: 0.51 mAP, RT-DETR: 0.65 mAP, YOLOv9: 0.598 mAP), particularly for night-time fire detection with reduced false positives from artificial lights.

Conclusion: The two-stage model and Patched-YOLO effectively address key challenges in fire detection, improving accuracy for night vision scenarios while reducing false alarms from artificial light sources and enhancing detection of small/distant objects.

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

TL;DR: Proposed SRFA framework for early pancreatic tumor detection using multimodal CT scans achieves 96.23% accuracy through MAGRes-UNet segmentation, DenseNet-121 feature extraction, hybrid HHO-BA feature selection, and Vision Transformer-EfficientNet-B3 classification with SSA-GWO optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early pancreatic tumor detection is challenging due to minimal contrast margins and large anatomical variations in CT scans, requiring systems that enhance subtle visual cues and generalize well across multimodal imaging data.

Method: SRFA framework with preprocessing, MAGRes-UNet segmentation, DenseNet-121 feature extraction with residual storage, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection, Vision Transformer-EfficientNet-B3 hybrid classification, and SSA-GWO dual optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Achieved 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score, and 94.83% specificity, significantly outperforming traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models.

Conclusion: SRFA framework demonstrates strong potential as a useful instrument for early pancreatic tumor detection, addressing clinical challenges through integrated deep learning and optimization techniques.

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and analyzes how data and modeling choices affect memorization levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding memorization in 3D generative models is important to prevent training data leakage and improve diversity of generated shapes, but current understanding is limited.

Method: The authors design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization, apply it to existing methods, and conduct controlled experiments with a latent vector-set diffusion model to study data and modeling factors.

Result: Memorization depends on data modality, increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning, peaks at moderate guidance scale, and can be reduced by longer vector-sets and simple rotation augmentation without degrading quality.

Conclusion: The framework provides empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggests effective strategies to reduce memorization while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use attention mechanisms with simplified motion models (like constant velocity) for temporal alignment, but these are suboptimal due to variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames.

Method: HAT uses multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances, then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues from cached object queries to select the optimal alignment proposal.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tracking with 46.0% AMOTA on nuScenes test set with DETR3D detector. Improves perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces collision rate by 32% in end-to-end AD. Maintains robust performance when semantics are corrupted.

Conclusion: HAT demonstrates that adaptive multi-hypothesis alignment with explicit motion modeling significantly improves temporal perception in autonomous driving, especially when semantic features are unreliable.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

*Keda Tao,Wenjie Du,Bohan Yu,Weiqiang Wang,Jian Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAgent is an audio-guided active perception agent that uses dynamic tool orchestration for fine-grained audio-visual reasoning, achieving 10-20% accuracy improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current omnimodal LLMs lack fine-grained cross-modal understanding and struggle with multimodal alignment, relying on rigid workflows and dense frame-captioning rather than active perception.

Method: OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate specialized tools on demand, using a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm where audio cues localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on three audio-video understanding benchmarks, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by 10-20% accuracy margins.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry, showing that audio-guided dynamic tool orchestration enables superior fine-grained audio-visual reasoning.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

### [243] [IDT: A Physically Grounded Transformer for Feed-Forward Multi-View Intrinsic Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23667)
*Kang Du,Yirui Guan,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDT is a feed-forward transformer framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition that produces view-consistent diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading without iterative sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects, making intrinsic decomposition fundamental for visual understanding. While recent diffusion-based methods work for single-view decomposition, extending to multi-view settings remains challenging due to severe view inconsistency issues.

Method: IDT uses transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, producing view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass. It adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into three components: diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading, separating Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, better-isolated specular components, and substantially improved multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

Conclusion: IDT provides an effective feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition that produces physically grounded, view-consistent decompositions without iterative generative sampling, enabling interpretable and controllable separation of material and illumination effects across views.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DKT: A video diffusion model adapted for temporally consistent depth and normal estimation of transparent/reflective objects, achieving SOTA on transparency benchmarks and improving robotic grasping success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent objects break assumptions of traditional depth estimation methods (stereo, ToF, monocular), causing holes and unstable estimates. Video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they've internalized optical rules that can be leveraged for perception.

Method: 1) Created TransPhy3D synthetic dataset: 11k sequences with RGB+depth+normals rendered with Blender/Cycles using physically-based ray tracing. 2) Adapted large video diffusion model via lightweight LoRA adapters to learn video-to-video translation for depth/normals. 3) Co-trained on TransPhy3D and existing synthetic datasets by concatenating RGB and noisy depth latents in DiT backbone.

Result: DKT achieves zero-shot SOTA on real/synthetic transparency benchmarks (ClearPose, DREDS, TransPhy3D-Test), improving accuracy and temporal consistency over strong baselines. A 1.3B version runs at ~0.17s/frame. Integrated into grasping stack, it boosts success rates across translucent, reflective, and diffuse surfaces.

Conclusion: Video diffusion priors can be efficiently repurposed into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging transparent/reflective objects, supporting the claim that "Diffusion knows transparency" and enabling better real-world manipulation.

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

TL;DR: Stream-DiffVSR is a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online video super-resolution that processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds, making it the first diffusion-based VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based VSR methods achieve strong perceptual quality but are impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising.

Method: A causally conditioned diffusion framework operating strictly on past frames, combining: 1) four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, 2) Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module injecting motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and 3) lightweight temporal-aware decoder with Temporal Processor Module (TPM) enhancing detail and temporal coherence.

Result: Processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on RTX4090 GPU, significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods, boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) compared to online SOTA TMP while reducing latency by over 130x, and reduces initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds.

Conclusion: Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment by combining causal conditioning, distilled denoising, and temporal guidance mechanisms.

### [246] [Field strength-dependent performance variability in deep learning-based analysis of magnetic resonance imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22176)
*Muhammad Ibtsaam Qadir,Duane Schonlau,Ulrike Dydak,Fiona R. Kolbinger*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MRI scanner field strength (1.5T vs 3.0T) significantly affects deep learning segmentation performance, especially for soft tissues, with 3.0T-trained models generally outperforming others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively evaluate how MRI scanner magnetic field strength impacts the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms, as field strength variations could be a confounding factor in AI studies.

Method: Used three public MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, cervical spine) stratified by field strength. Developed three nnU-Net models per task: trained on 1.5T only, 3.0T only, and combined data. Evaluated each model on both field strengths. Analyzed field-strength effects using UMAP clustering and radiomic analysis (23 features).

Result: For breast tumor and pancreas segmentation, 3.0T-trained models significantly outperformed others on both validation sets. Cervical spine models performed optimally on same-field data with minimal cross-field degradation. Radiomic analysis showed moderate field-strength clustering in soft tissues but minimal separation in osseous structures.

Conclusion: Magnetic field strength substantially influences deep learning segmentation performance, particularly for soft-tissue structures. Field strength should be considered as a confounding factor in AI studies on MRI.

Abstract: This study quantitatively evaluates the impact of MRI scanner magnetic field strength on the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. Three publicly available MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, and cervical spine) were stratified by scanner field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T). For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p<0.0001). Pancreas segmentation showed similar trends: m-3.0T achieved the highest DSC (0.774 [1.5T], 0.840 [3.0T]), while m-1.5T underperformed significantly (p<0.0001). For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC>0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12). These results indicate that magnetic field strength in the training data substantially influences the performance of deep learning-based segmentation models, particularly for soft-tissue structures (e.g., small lesions). This warrants consideration of magnetic field strength as a confounding factor in studies evaluating AI performance on MRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in brain tumor diagnosis in low-resource environments where expert neuroradiology, high-end MRI, and invasive biopsies are limited. Overcome deep learning limitations like computational demands, dataset shift, and poor interpretability.

Method: Two-branch approach: 1) MobileNetV2-based CNN for classification, 2) radiomics branch extracting 8 handcrafted features (shape, intensity statistics, GLCM texture). Late fusion concatenates CNN embeddings with radiomics features, followed by RandomForest classifier. Explainability via Grad-CAM and feature importance analysis.

Result: Fusion approach shows improved validation performance compared to single-branch baselines on Kaggle brain tumor MRI dataset. Robustness tests under reduced resolution and additive noise reveal sensitivity relevant to low-resource imaging conditions.

Conclusion: The prototype virtual biopsy pipeline demonstrates potential for brain tumor classification in resource-limited settings, providing interpretable decision support while emphasizing it's not a substitute for clinical diagnosis or histopathology.

Abstract: Timely brain tumor diagnosis remains challenging in low-resource clinical environments where expert neuroradiology interpretation, high-end MRI hardware, and invasive biopsy procedures may be limited. Although deep learning has achieved strong performance in brain tumor analysis, real-world adoption is constrained by computational demands, dataset shift across scanners, and limited interpretability. This paper presents a prototype virtual biopsy pipeline for four-class classification of 2D brain MRI images using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) and complementary radiomics-style handcrafted features. A MobileNetV2-based CNN is trained for classification, while an interpretable radiomics branch extracts eight features capturing lesion shape, intensity statistics, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture descriptors. A late fusion strategy concatenates CNN embeddings with radiomics features and trains a RandomForest classifier on the fused representation. Explainability is provided via Grad-CAM visualizations and radiomics feature importance analysis. Experiments on a public Kaggle brain tumor MRI dataset show improved validation performance for fusion relative to single-branch baselines, while robustness tests under reduced resolution and additive noise highlight sensitivity relevant to low-resource imaging conditions. The system is framed as decision support and not a substitute for clinical diagnosis or histopathology.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-quality SMWI reconstruction from reduced k-space sampling, leading to shorter scan times without compromising diagnostic detail. Has potential to improve clinical applicability of SMWI for Parkinson's disease and support faster neuroimaging workflows.

Abstract: Susceptibility Map Weighted Imaging (SMWI) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique used to detect nigral hyperintensity in Parkinsons disease. However, full resolution SMWI acquisition is limited by long scan times.

The proposed method reconstructs high quality SMWI images from low resolution k space inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a structural similarity index of 0.9116 and a mean squared error of 0.076 when reconstructing SMWI from 256 by 256 k space data, while maintaining critical diagnostic features. This approach enables high quality SMWI reconstruction from reduced k space sampling, leading to shorter scan times without compromising diagnostic detail.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based super-resolution framework (SR3) enhances low-resolution capsule endoscopy images, outperforming traditional methods with better anatomical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capsule endoscopy has low-resolution images due to hardware/power/transmission constraints, limiting identification of fine mucosal textures and subtle pathologies needed for early diagnosis.

Method: Adopts SR3 framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn probabilistic mapping from low to high resolution. Uses HyperKvasir dataset for training/evaluation, with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms.

Result: Significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based methods (ESRGAN): PSNR 27.5 dB/SSIM 0.65 (baseline), improved to 29.3 dB/0.71 with enhancements. Better preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based super-resolution is promising for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where resolution is fundamentally constrained.

Abstract: Capsule endoscopy has enabled minimally invasive gastrointestinal imaging, but its clinical utility is limited by the inherently low resolution of captured images due to hardware, power, and transmission constraints. This limitation hampers the identification of fine-grained mucosal textures and subtle pathological features essential for early diagnosis.
  This work investigates a diffusion-based super-resolution framework to enhance capsule endoscopy images in a data-driven and anatomically consistent manner. We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images. Unlike GAN-based approaches that often suffer from training instability and hallucination artifacts, diffusion models provide stable likelihood-based training and improved structural fidelity. The HyperKvasir dataset, a large-scale publicly available gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, is used for training and evaluation.
  Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution methods such as ESRGAN, achieving PSNR of 27.5 dB and SSIM of 0.65 for a baseline model, and improving to 29.3 dB and 0.71 with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms. Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures. These findings indicate that diffusion-based super-resolution is a promising approach for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where image resolution is fundamentally constrained.

TL;DR: MEGA-PCC is an end-to-end learning-based framework for joint compression of point cloud geometry and attributes using Mamba architecture, eliminating manual bitrate tuning and recoloring procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud compression methods rely on post-hoc recoloring and manually tuned bitrate allocation between geometry and attributes, which prevents end-to-end optimization and increases system complexity.

Method: Two specialized models: 1) Main compression model with shared encoder for unified latent representation and dual decoders for sequential geometry-attribute reconstruction, 2) Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) for enhanced entropy coding by capturing spatial and channel-wise correlations. Both use Mamba architecture for long-range dependency modeling.

Result: MEGA-PCC achieves superior rate-distortion performance and runtime efficiency compared to both traditional and learning-based baselines, enabling data-driven bitrate allocation during training.

Conclusion: MEGA-PCC offers a powerful AI-driven solution for point cloud compression by eliminating recoloring and heuristic bitrate tuning, simplifying the pipeline while improving performance.

Abstract: Joint compression of point cloud geometry and attributes is essential for efficient 3D data representation. Existing methods often rely on post-hoc recoloring procedures and manually tuned bitrate allocation between geometry and attribute bitstreams in inference, which hinders end-to-end optimization and increases system complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose MEGA-PCC, a fully end-to-end, learning-based framework featuring two specialized models for joint compression. The main compression model employs a shared encoder that encodes both geometry and attribute information into a unified latent representation, followed by dual decoders that sequentially reconstruct geometry and then attributes. Complementing this, the Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) enhances entropy coding by capturing spatial and channel-wise correlations to improve probability estimation. Both models are built on the Mamba architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies and rich contextual features. By eliminating the need for recoloring and heuristic bitrate tuning, MEGA-PCC enables data-driven bitrate allocation during training and simplifies the overall pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEGA-PCC achieves superior rate-distortion performance and runtime efficiency compared to both traditional and learning-based baselines, offering a powerful solution for AI-driven point cloud compression.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT reduces radiation dose but causes severe streak artifacts due to ill-posed conditions. Existing deep learning methods still face challenges in reconstruction quality.

Method: Uses semantic feature contrastive learning loss evaluating semantic similarity in high-level latent spaces and anatomical similarity in shallow spaces. Employs three-stage U-Net architecture: coarse reconstruction, detail refinement, and semantic similarity measurement.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster processing on chest dataset with orthogonal projections compared to other algorithms. Maintains low computational complexity.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for orthogonal CT reconstruction with significant image quality improvements while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used in medical imaging, with sparse-view reconstruction offering an effective way to reduce radiation dose. However, ill-posed conditions often result in severe streak artifacts. Recent advances in deep learning-based methods have improved reconstruction quality, but challenges still remain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semantic feature contrastive learning loss function that evaluates semantic similarity in high-level latent spaces and anatomical similarity in shallow latent spaces. Our approach utilizes a three-stage U-Net-based architecture: one for coarse reconstruction, one for detail refinement, and one for semantic similarity measurement. Tests on a chest dataset with orthogonal projections demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster processing compared to other algorithms. The results show significant improvements in image quality while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a practical solution for orthogonal CT reconstruction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SwinCCIR is an end-to-end deep learning framework using swin-transformer blocks and transposed convolutions to directly reconstruct gamma source distributions from Compton camera list-mode events, overcoming traditional back-projection artifacts and systematic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compton cameras suffer from severe artifacts and deformation due to back-projection reconstruction principles, and systematic errors from device performance that degrade imaging quality. Existing iterative and deep-learning methods still rely on back-projection results.

Method: Proposed SwinCCIR, an end-to-end deep learning framework using swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module to directly establish relationships between list-mode events and radioactive source distributions.

Result: SwinCCIR was trained and validated on both simulated and practical datasets, effectively overcoming problems of conventional Compton camera imaging and showing potential for practical implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed SwinCCIR framework successfully addresses fundamental reconstruction issues in Compton camera imaging through an end-to-end deep learning approach, demonstrating effectiveness for practical applications.

Abstract: Compton cameras (CCs) are a kind of gamma cameras which are designed to determine the directions of incident gammas based on the Compton scatter. However, the reconstruction of CCs face problems of severe artifacts and deformation due to the fundamental reconstruction principle of back-projection of Compton cones. Besides, a part of systematic errors originated from the performance of devices are hard to remove through calibration, leading to deterioration of imaging quality. Iterative algorithms and deep-learning based methods have been widely used to improve reconstruction. But most of them are optimization based on the results of back-projection. Therefore, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework, SwinCCIR, for CC imaging. Through adopting swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module, we established the relationship between the list-mode events and the radioactive source distribution. SwinCCIR was trained and validated on both simulated and practical dataset. The experimental results indicate that SwinCCIR effectively overcomes problems of conventional CC imaging, which are expected to be implemented in practical applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EIR method improves chest X-ray report generation by addressing information asymmetry between visual and metadata representations using cross-modal transformers and medical domain pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for automatic medical report generation from chest X-rays suffer from two main problems: 1) information asymmetry when integrating metadata with visual representations using simple operations, and 2) domain gap when using natural image pre-trained models for medical images.

Method: Proposes Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) with two key components: 1) cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, addressing information asymmetry, and 2) medical domain pre-trained models to encode chest X-ray images, bridging the domain gap.

Result: Experimental results on MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for generating accurate chest X-ray reports.

Conclusion: The EIR approach successfully addresses both information asymmetry and domain gap problems in medical report generation, leading to improved performance on standard benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Generating medical reports from chest X-ray images is a critical and time-consuming task for radiologists, especially in emergencies. To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple "Add and LayerNorm" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

*Borong Zhang,Jiahao Li,Jiachen Shen,Yishuai Cai,Yuhao Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Juntao Dai,Jiaming Ji,Yaodong Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA-Arena is a comprehensive benchmark for Vision-Language-Action models that systematically evaluates their capabilities and failure modes through structured task design across three orthogonal axes: task structure, language commands, and visual observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLAs are advancing rapidly, there's a lack of quantitative understanding of their limits and failure modes. Current evaluation methods don't systematically measure model capability frontiers or identify specific weaknesses.

Method: Proposes a structured task design framework with 170 tasks grouped into four dimensions (Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, Long Horizon), each with three difficulty levels. Orthogonal language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations enable decoupled analysis of robustness. Fine-tuning only on easiest level (L0) to assess generalization.

Result: Evaluation reveals critical VLA limitations: strong memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, lack of safety constraint consideration, and inability to compose skills for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-Arena provides a systematic benchmark for understanding VLA limitations and fostering research to address them. The framework includes complete toolchain, datasets, and leaderboard to ensure reproducibility and advance the field.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are rapidly advancing towards generalist robot policies, it remains difficult to quantitatively understand their limits and failure modes. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning. Our benchmark, data, models, and leaderboard are available at https://vla-arena.github.io.

*Yufan He,Pengfei Guo,Mengya Xu,Zhaoshuo Li,Andriy Myronenko,Dillan Imans,Bingjie Liu,Dongren Yang,Mingxue Gu,Yongnan Ji,Yueming Jin,Ren Zhao,Baiyong Shen,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Surgical VLA policy trained on synthetic video-action data from SurgWorld outperforms real-demo-only training, enabling scalable autonomous surgical skill acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical robotics lacks paired video-action datasets needed for VLA training, while abundant surgical videos exist without action labels, creating a data scarcity barrier to autonomous surgical robots.

Method: Created SATA dataset with surgical action descriptions, built SurgWorld world model to generate realistic surgery videos, used inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic videos, and trained surgical VLA policy on this augmented data.

Result: Surgical VLA policy trained with augmented synthetic data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform.

Conclusion: The approach offers scalable path to autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging unlabeled surgical videos and generative world modeling, enabling generalizable and data-efficient surgical robot policies.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PCR-ORB enhances ORB-SLAM3 with deep learning-based point cloud refinement to handle dynamic environments by filtering moving objects using YOLOv8 semantic segmentation and CUDA acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vSLAM systems struggle in dynamic environments where moving objects degrade tracking accuracy and map consistency, creating a need for robust solutions that can handle real-world complexity.

Method: Enhanced ORB-SLAM3 framework integrating YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation with CUDA-accelerated processing. Uses multi-stage filtering: ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation.

Result: Mixed performance across KITTI sequences 00-09. Best improvement in sequence 04: 25.9% ATE RMSE reduction and 30.4% ATE median reduction. Performance varies by environmental conditions and scene types.

Conclusion: PCR-ORB shows scenario-dependent effectiveness in dynamic environments, providing insights into dynamic object filtering challenges while demonstrating potential for robust navigation in complex settings.

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments where moving objects compromise tracking accuracy and map consistency. This paper introduces PCR-ORB (Point Cloud Refinement ORB), an enhanced ORB-SLAM3 framework that integrates deep learning-based point cloud refinement to mitigate dynamic object interference. Our approach employs YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation combined with CUDA-accelerated processing to achieve real-time performance. The system implements a multi-stage filtering strategy encompassing ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation. Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types. Notable improvements are observed in specific sequences, with sequence 04 achieving 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median. However, results show mixed performance across sequences, indicating scenario-dependent effectiveness. The implementation provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments.

### [257] [RoboMirror: Understand Before You Imitate for Video to Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23649)
*Zhe Li,Cheng Chi,Yangyang Wei,Boan Zhu,Tao Huang,Zhenguo Sun,Yibo Peng,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Fangzhou Liu,Chang Xu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboMirror is a video-to-locomotion framework that uses visual language models to understand videos and generate physically plausible humanoid locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid locomotion systems rely on curated motion capture or sparse text commands, creating a gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods have semantic sparsity issues, while video-based approaches only do mechanical pose mimicry without genuine understanding.

Method: RoboMirror uses visual language models (VLMs) to distill raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting.

Result: RoboMirror enables telepresence via egocentric videos, reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines.

Conclusion: By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, RoboMirror bridges the gap between visual understanding and action, embodying "understand before you imitate" for more natural humanoid locomotion.

Abstract: Humans learn locomotion through visual observation, interpreting visual content first before imitating actions. However, state-of-the-art humanoid locomotion systems rely on either curated motion capture trajectories or sparse text commands, leaving a critical gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity and staged pipeline errors, while video-based approaches only perform mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding. We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying "understand before you imitate". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines. By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, we bridge the visual understanding and action gap.

*Mahadev Sunil Kumar,Arnab Raha,Debayan Das,Gopakumar G,Amitava Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A method for efficient deployment of distributed DNNs on edge devices through structured pruning and multi-objective optimization, demonstrated with MVCNN for 3D object recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are essential for computer vision but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high parameter counts and computational demands.

Method: Integrates structured model pruning with multi-objective optimization to tailor network capacity to hardware constraints, using view-adaptive compression for MVCNN by quantifying individual view contributions and allocating pruning budgets accordingly.

Result: Resulting models satisfy user-specified accuracy and memory footprint bounds while reducing inference latency by 1.2x to 5.0x across diverse hardware platforms.

Conclusion: Performance-aware, view-adaptive compression provides a viable pathway for deploying complex vision models in distributed edge environments.

Abstract: Deep distributed networks (DNNs) have become central to modern computer vision, yet their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains hindered by substantial parameter counts and computational demands. Here, we present an approach to the efficient deployment of distributed DNNs that jointly respects hardware limitations and preserves task performance. Our method integrates a structured model pruning with a multi-objective optimization to tailor network capacity to heterogeneous device constraints. We demonstrate this framework using Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN), a state-of-the-art architecture for 3D object recognition, by quantifying the contribution of individual views to classification accuracy and allocating pruning budgets, respectively. Experimental results show that the resulting models satisfy user-specified bounds on accuracy and memory footprint while reducing inference latency by factors ranging from 1.2x to 5.0x across diverse hardware platforms. These findings suggest that performance-aware, view-adaptive compression provides a viable pathway for deploying complex vision models in distributed edge environments.

### [259] [JParc: Joint cortical surface parcellation with registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22485)
*Jian Li,Karthik Gopinath,Brian L. Edlow,Adrian V. Dalca,Bruce Fischl*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: JParc is a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by combining accurate registration with learned atlas propagation, achieving >90% Dice score using basic geometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based parcellation methods have shifted away from traditional registration and atlas propagation approaches without understanding why they perform better. There's a need to bridge this gap and leverage the strengths of both approaches for improved cortical surface parcellation.

Method: JParc is a joint framework that combines cortical registration and parcellation. It uses a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune propagated atlas labels, working with basic geometric features like sulcal depth and curvature that describe cortical folding patterns.

Result: JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. The enhanced performance is primarily due to accurate cortical registration and learned parcellation atlas.

Conclusion: The joint approach of registration and parcellation in JParc provides superior accuracy that can significantly increase statistical power in brain mapping studies and support various neuroscientific and clinical applications including surgical planning.

Abstract: Cortical surface parcellation is a fundamental task in both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications, enabling more accurate mapping of brain regions. Model-based and learning-based approaches for automated parcellation alleviate the need for manual labeling. Despite the advancement in parcellation performance, learning-based methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without exploring the reason for the improvement compared to traditional methods. In this study, we present JParc, a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. In rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the enhanced performance of JParc is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas. By leveraging a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune the propagated atlas labels, JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, using only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns. The superior accuracy of JParc can significantly increase the statistical power in brain mapping studies as well as support applications in surgical planning and many other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks.

### [260] [The Big Three in Marriage Talk: LLM-Assisted Analysis of Moral Ethics and Sentiment on Weibo and Xiaohongshu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23609)
*Frank Tian-Fang Ye,Xiaozi Gao*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: LLM-assisted analysis of 219K Chinese social media posts reveals platform differences in marriage sentiment and moral reasoning, with Autonomy/Community ethics linked to negative attitudes while Divinity ethics shows neutral/positive sentiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand declining marriage rates in China (13.47M to 6.1M couples from 2013-2024) by examining not just emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying public attitudes toward marriage.

Method: Analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu using LLM-assisted content analysis. Applied Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework (Autonomy, Community, Divinity) to code posts for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions.

Result: Platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, Xiaohongshu predominantly neutral. Most posts lacked explicit moral framing. When moral ethics were invoked: Autonomy and Community ethics were predominantly negative, while Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral/positive sentiment.

Conclusion: Concerns about personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in China. LLMs enable scaling qualitative analysis. Findings offer insights for culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline.

Abstract: China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.

*Alexandru Hegyi*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: A semi-automatic glacier mapping workflow using GeoSAM and Sentinel-2 imagery for consistent multi-temporal glacier delineation in Svalbard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing glacier boundary delineation methods are difficult to scale across long time series and heterogeneous environments, creating a need for more efficient and consistent approaches.

Method: Combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based ice identification, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically based post-processing to derive annual glacier outlines from Sentinel-2 imagery.

Result: Produces spatially coherent and temporally consistent outlines for major glacier bodies in Ny-Alesund and Kongsfjorden region, with most errors associated with small features affected by water bodies, terrain shadows, or surface variability.

Conclusion: The workflow provides a fast, practical, and transferable alternative for multi-temporal glacier mapping, though user inspection remains necessary for filtering incorrect polygons and adjusting local thresholds.

Abstract: Consistent glacier boundary delineation is essential for monitoring glacier change, yet many existing approaches are difficult to scale across long time series and heterogeneous environments. In this report, we present a GeoSAM-based, semi-automatic workflow for rapid glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery. The method combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based identification of candidate ice areas, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically based post-processing to derive annual glacier outlines. The workflow is demonstrated in the Ny-Alesund and Kongsfjorden region of western Svalbard across multiple years of the Sentinel-2 era. Results show that the approach produces spatially coherent and temporally consistent outlines for major glacier bodies, while most errors are associated with small features affected by water bodies, terrain shadows, or high surface variability. The reliance on derived RGB imagery makes the method flexible and transferable to other optical datasets, with improved performance expected at higher spatial resolution. Although user inspection remains necessary to filter incorrect polygons and adjust thresholds for local conditions, the workflow provides a fast and practical alternative for multi-temporal glacier mapping and ice-loss assessment.

Conclusion: Mesquite lowers motion capture barriers through IoT principles, edge processing, and web-native stack. Hardware, firmware, and software released as open-source (GNU GPL).

Abstract: Motion capture remains costly and complex to deploy, limiting use outside specialized laboratories. We present Mesquite, an open-source, low-cost inertial motion-capture system that combines a body-worn network of 15 IMU sensor nodes with a hip-worn Android smartphone for position tracking. A low-power wireless link streams quaternion orientations to a central USB dongle and a browser-based application for real-time visualization and recording. Built on modern web technologies -- WebGL for rendering, WebXR for SLAM, WebSerial and WebSockets for device and network I/O, and Progressive Web Apps for packaging -- the system runs cross-platform entirely in the browser. In benchmarks against a commercial optical system, Mesquite achieves mean joint-angle error of 2-5 degrees while operating at approximately 5% of the cost. The system sustains 30 frames per second with end-to-end latency under 15ms and a packet delivery rate of at least 99.7% in standard indoor environments. By leveraging IoT principles, edge processing, and a web-native stack, Mesquite lowers the barrier to motion capture for applications in entertainment, biomechanics, healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. We release hardware designs, firmware, and software under an open-source license (GNU GPL).

*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Louis Mahon,Wayne Luk,Anton Isopoussu,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies "secondary attention sinks" - tokens that become attention sinks in middle layers with different properties than primary BOS sinks, formed by specific MLP modules mapping tokens to align with primary sink directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work identified attention sinks (like BOS tokens) but focused on primary sinks that emerge early and persist throughout networks. This work discovers secondary sinks with fundamentally different properties that appear in middle layers, requiring deeper analysis of their formation and impact.

Method: Extensive experiments across 11 model families analyzing attention patterns, identifying secondary sinks in middle layers, studying their formation through MLP modules, measuring sink scores via ℓ2-norm of alignment vectors, and tracking sink persistence across layers.

Result: Secondary sinks are formed by middle-layer MLPs that map token representations to align with primary sink directions; their ℓ2-norm determines sink score and persistence; primary sinks weaken in middle layers coinciding with secondary sink emergence; larger models show more deterministic sink levels (3 in QwQ-32B, 6 in Qwen3-14B).

Conclusion: Attention sinks are more complex than previously understood, with secondary sinks emerging in middle layers through specific MLP mechanisms, having different properties and impacts than primary sinks, and showing more deterministic patterns in larger-scale models.

Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.

### [264] [Learning from Negative Examples: Why Warning-Framed Training Data Teaches What It Warns Against](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22293)
*Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Warning-framed content in training data fails to teach LLMs to avoid warned behavior; models reproduce flagged content at similar rates regardless of warnings due to overlapping latent features for "describing" vs "performing" actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why language models fail to learn from warnings in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") and instead reproduce the warned-against behavior at similar rates as when given the content directly.

Method: Conducted experiments comparing reproduction rates of flagged content between models exposed to warnings vs. direct content; used sparse autoencoder analysis to examine latent feature activation patterns; identified specific features (like #8684 tracking code execution) that fire similarly in warning and exploitation contexts; analyzed "stealth slip" phenomenon where conversational preambles rotate activations into subspaces missed by linear probes.

Result: Models reproduced flagged content at statistically indistinguishable rates: 76.7% for warning-exposed models vs. 83.3% for models given content directly. Sparse autoencoder analysis revealed overlapping latent features for "describing X" and "performing X," with feature #8684 activating comparably in both contexts. Prompting and inference-time steering failed to fix the issue, while training-time feature ablation was effective.

Conclusion: Statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current LLM architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context rather than understanding why content appears there. Warning-framed content doesn't teach avoidance behavior due to failure of orthogonalization between descriptive and performative features, requiring training-time interventions rather than prompting-based solutions.

Abstract: Warning-framed content in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") does not, it turns out, teach language models to avoid the warned-against behavior. In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: "describing X" and "performing X" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call "stealth slip", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFA-LoRA enhances LoRA by adding non-linear expressivity while maintaining mergeability through an annealed activation function that transitions from non-linear to linear during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's linear adaptation process limits its expressive power, creating a gap between linear and non-linear training. The authors aim to bridge this gap while maintaining LoRA's seamless mergeability.

Method: Proposes AFA-LoRA with an annealed activation function that transitions from non-linear to linear transformation during training, allowing initial strong representational capabilities before converging to mergeable linear form.

Result: AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training across supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding tasks.

Conclusion: The work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation by combining non-linear expressivity with LoRA's mergeability.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

*Shuyu Gan,James Mooney,Pan Hao,Renxiang Wang,Mingyi Hong,Qianwen Wang,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective TTS: A process-based refinement framework for multi-agent LLM pipelines that distributes compute across stages and prunes low-quality branches early to improve insight quality under fixed compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-stage pipeline tasks often lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data for robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulating errors over stages. Traditional Test-Time Scaling (TTS) approaches that refine iteratively over time are insufficient for these complex, open-ended tasks.

Method: Selective TTS distributes compute across different stages in multi-agent pipelines instead of repeated refinement over time. It uses process-specific judges to prune low-quality branches early, mitigating judge drift and stabilizing refinement. The approach is demonstrated through an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating insightful charts and reports from datasets, with a reliable LLM-based judge model aligned with human experts.

Result: The selective TTS framework improves insight quality under fixed compute budgets, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. The LLM-based judge model achieves strong alignment with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55).

Conclusion: Selective TTS represents a promising approach for scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation, by distributing refinement across pipeline stages rather than time.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can increasingly automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), iterative refinement guided by reward signals. However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.

TL;DR: GraphLogDebugger: A dynamic graph-based framework for debugging tabular logs that outperforms LLMs with simpler GNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular log debugging methods overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and heavy-load models, suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. Tabular logs abstract real-world systems and report updates, enabling efficient inconsistency detection, but existing approaches are too computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes GraphLogDebugger framework that constructs heterogeneous nodes for objects and events from tabular logs, connects them with node-wise edges to recover the system as an evolving dynamic graph. Uses a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) for debugging instead of heavy LLMs.

Result: Experimental results on real-world log datasets (computer systems and academic papers) show that the dynamic graph modeling enables a simple dynamic GNN to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular logs.

Conclusion: Dynamic graph modeling provides an effective alternative to LLMs for tabular log debugging, offering better performance with simpler models while addressing flexibility and scalability limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

*Yingru Li,Ziniu Li,Jiacai Liu*

TL;DR: A unified LLM fine-tuning framework combining Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning through gradient decomposition into dense (token-level imitation) and sparse (long-horizon reward) components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified approach for LLM fine-tuning that bridges the gap between imitation learning (for token-level guidance) and reinforcement learning (for long-horizon task optimization), addressing the limitations of using either method alone.

Method: Analyzes the gradient of a composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, decomposing it into: 1) Dense Gradient (analytically computable for token-level imitation) with closed-form logit-level formula, and 2) Sparse Gradient (Monte Carlo estimated for long-horizon reward optimization).

Result: Developed a framework that enables efficient GPU implementation through the closed-form dense gradient component while maintaining the ability to optimize for long-term rewards via the sparse gradient component.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework provides an efficient and theoretically grounded approach to LLM fine-tuning that leverages both imitation learning and reinforcement learning strengths through gradient decomposition.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning that integrates Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. By analyzing the gradient of a composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, we derive a natural decomposition into two components: (1) an analytically computable Dense Gradient for token-level imitation, and (2) a Monte Carlo estimated Sparse Gradient for long-horizon reward optimization. The Dense Gradient admits a closed-form logit-level formula, enabling efficient GPU implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends neural scaling laws to familial models with early exits, introducing granularity (G) as a third scaling variable alongside model size (N) and tokens (D), showing minimal performance penalty for deployment flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural scaling laws assume single dense model outputs, overlooking the "familial models" paradigm needed for ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. There's a need to extend scaling laws to capture the "one-run, many-models" approach where multiple deployable sub-models are generated from a shared backbone.

Method: Proposed a unified functional form L(N, D, G) for scaling laws with granularity as a third variable. Used rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Systematically swept model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D) across fixed budgets to decouple granularity costs from scale benefits.

Result: The granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent, meaning deployment flexibility can be achieved with minimal performance cost. This validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm without compromising compute-optimality compared to dense baselines.

Conclusion: Theoretical extension of scaling laws bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically demonstrates that familial models enable deployment flexibility across heterogeneous systems while maintaining computational efficiency, supporting the vision of ubiquitous intelligence.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.

Abstract: Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to train language models to generate better research plans by using reinforcement learning with self-grading, leveraging automatically extracted research goals and rubrics from existing papers across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements, limiting their effectiveness as AI co-scientists. There's a need for scalable, automated training methods that can improve research plan generation without requiring extensive human supervision.

Method: The authors build a diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. They then train models via reinforcement learning with self-grading, where a frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision.

Result: Human experts preferred plans generated by the finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals and approved 84% of automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. The approach showed 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, working effectively even in domains like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe for improving AI co-scientists, showing that reinforcement learning with self-grading using automatically extracted research goals and rubrics can significantly enhance research plan generation across multiple domains.

Abstract: AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.

TL;DR: SoliReward: A systematic framework for training video reward models with better data collection, architecture, and loss functions to address labeling noise, architectural limitations, and reward hacking in video generation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reward models face three main challenges: noisy pairwise annotations from in-prompt data collection, underexplored VLM-based RM architectures (especially output mechanisms), and susceptibility to reward hacking during post-training alignment.

Method: 1) Single-item binary annotations for cost-efficient data collection with cross-prompt pairing; 2) Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention for enhanced feature aggregation; 3) Modified Bradley-Terry loss that handles win-tie scenarios and regularizes score distribution for positive samples.

Result: Validated on benchmarks for physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment. Shows improvements in direct RM evaluation metrics and enhances post-training efficacy on video generation models.

Conclusion: SoliReward provides a comprehensive solution to key challenges in video reward modeling, offering better data collection, architectural improvements, and loss function modifications that collectively improve alignment of video generation models with human preferences.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of video generation models with human preferences is a critical goal. Developing effective Reward Models (RMs) for this process faces significant methodological hurdles. Current data collection paradigms, reliant on in-prompt pairwise annotations, suffer from labeling noise. Concurrently, the architectural design of VLM-based RMs, particularly their output mechanisms, remains underexplored. Furthermore, RM is susceptible to reward hacking in post-training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose SoliReward, a systematic framework for video RM training. Our framework first sources high-quality, cost-efficient data via single-item binary annotations, then constructs preference pairs using a cross-prompt pairing strategy. Architecturally, we employ a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, we introduce a modified BT loss that explicitly accommodates win-tie scenarios. This approach regularizes the RM's score distribution for positive samples, providing more nuanced preference signals to alleviate over-focus on a small number of top-scoring samples. Our approach is validated on benchmarks evaluating physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment, demonstrating improvements in direct RM evaluation metrics and in the efficacy of post-training on video generation models. Code and benchmark will be publicly available.

TL;DR: Masters is a mask-progressive reinforcement learning framework for distilling knowledge from large vision-language teachers to compact student models by masking non-dominant weights and using offline RL with dual rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs are impractical for mobile/edge deployment due to size, but distilling knowledge from large teachers to small students is challenging due to the size gap causing unstable learning and degraded performance.

Method: Mask-progressive RL distillation: 1) Mask non-dominant teacher weights to reduce complexity, 2) Progressively restore teacher capacity during training, 3) Offline RL stage with accuracy and distillation rewards using pre-generated responses from masked teachers.

Result: Enables students to learn richer representations smoothly and stably, achieving strong performance without expensive think-answer processes, providing efficient guidance for knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: Masters addresses the size gap challenge in VLM distillation through progressive masking and offline RL, enabling compact yet capable student models for practical deployment.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI lung cancer risk models show demographic performance disparities: Sybil performs better for women than men, and Venkadesh21 has lower sensitivity for Black vs White participants at fixed specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI models show promise for lung cancer risk estimation from LDCT scans, their performance across diverse demographic groups remains uncertain, raising concerns about potential algorithmic bias and fairness in clinical implementation.

Method: Used JustEFAB framework to evaluate fairness in two deep learning models (Sybil and Venkadesh21) and PanCan2b logistic regression model. Trained on NLST data and assessed on held-out validation set. Evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, specificity across demographic subgroups and explored confounding from clinical factors.

Result: Sybil showed statistically significant AUROC difference: women (0.88) vs men (0.81). Venkadesh21 at 90% specificity had lower sensitivity for Black (0.39) vs White (0.69) participants. Differences not explained by clinical confounders, suggesting unfair biases.

Conclusion: AI lung cancer screening models exhibit demographic performance disparities that may constitute unfair biases, highlighting the need for improved model development, monitoring across underrepresented groups, and further fairness research in clinical AI.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.

*Zheng Xing,Weibing Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel unsupervised human motion segmentation method that integrates temporal vision semantics from LLMs into subspace clustering, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subspace clustering methods for human motion segmentation overlook temporal semantic exploration. The authors recognize that temporal vision semantics derived from motion sequences can significantly enhance clustering performance, but existing methods fail to leverage this semantic information effectively.

Method: The method extracts textual motion information from consecutive frames using LLM's image-to-text capabilities, learns temporal neighboring information from LLM responses, and integrates this into subspace clustering with temporal regularizers. It features a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach with temporal constraints and a feedback-enabled framework for continuous optimization.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating temporal vision semantics from LLMs into subspace clustering.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal vision semantics from LLMs into subspace clustering significantly improves human motion segmentation performance, addressing the limitation of traditional methods that overlook temporal semantic exploration.

Abstract: Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

TL;DR: Co-GRPO reformulates Masked Diffusion Models as a unified MDP to jointly optimize model parameters and inference schedules using trajectory-level policy optimization, bridging the training-inference gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental discrepancy between MDM training (single-step BERT-style objective) and inference (multi-step iterative process with various schedules). This disconnect leaves inference schedules unoptimized during training, creating a misalignment between training paradigm and inference trajectory.

Method: Co-GRPO reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process that jointly incorporates both the model and inference schedule. It applies Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level to cooperatively optimize model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, avoiding costly backpropagation through multi-step generation.

Result: Empirical results across four benchmarks (ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench) demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing substantial improvement in generation quality through holistic optimization.

Conclusion: Co-GRPO provides a more thorough alignment between training and inference for Masked Diffusion Models by jointly optimizing both model parameters and inference schedules at the trajectory level, leading to improved generation performance.

Abstract: Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is uncertain and under-constrained, especially for extreme weather events. Existing generative approaches rely primarily on visual conditioning, leaving future motion weakly constrained and ambiguous. There's a need for better constraints on precipitation evolution.

Conclusion: The proposed language-aware multimodal approach effectively constrains precipitation evolution through semantic motion descriptions, leading to significant improvements in nowcasting accuracy, particularly for heavy rainfall events at extended lead times.

Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is an inherently uncertain and under-constrained spatiotemporal forecasting problem, especially for rapidly evolving and extreme weather events.

TL;DR: A scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates continuous retraining by using latent-space alignment and graph neural networks to handle concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-based IoT threat detection models rely on stationary datasets that don't reflect dynamic real-world IoT NetFlow traffic affected by concept drift. Existing solutions require periodic retraining, causing high computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Train a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, then use an alignment model to map incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space before classification. Transform low-dimensional latent representations into graph-structured format to capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, and classify using a graph neural network.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments by preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks while handling concept drift without continuous retraining.

Abstract: Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.

Motivation: To create a unified ML framework inspired by quantum mechanics that provides robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology as an alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention.

Method: Three tightly coupled components: (1) time-independent wave-energy solver treating perception/classification as spectral decomposition under learned Hamiltonian; (2) time-dependent dynamical solver for semantic wavefunction evolution enabling context-aware decision revision; (3) low-rank operator calculus learning symbolic transformations through quantum-like transition operators.

Conclusion: Suggests new foundational direction for ML where learning is cast as discovering and navigating underlying semantic energy landscape, offering physics-driven alternative with robust generalization and interpretable semantics.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Schrödinger AI}, a unified machine learning framework inspired by quantum mechanics. The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.
  Empirically, Schrödinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length.

TL;DR: RL-based distillation framework for diffusion models that treats distillation as policy optimization, using reward signals from teacher alignment to guide students to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating more efficient models through distillation, but moving beyond fixed reconstruction/consistency losses to a more flexible, dynamic approach.

Method: Treats distillation as a policy optimization problem where the student is trained using reward signals derived from alignment with teacher outputs. Uses RL to dynamically guide students to explore multiple denoising paths and take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions.

Result: Achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. The framework is model-agnostic and applicable to any diffusion model with suitable reward functions.

Conclusion: Proposes a general RL-based optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning that enables faster sampling while maintaining quality, offering a flexible alternative to traditional distillation approaches.

Abstract: Distillation addresses the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating models with smaller size or fewer steps that approximate the behavior of high-step teachers. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. Additionally, the framework is model agnostic, applicable to any type of diffusion models with suitable reward functions, providing a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning.

*Mingyuan Zhang,Yue Bai,Yifan Wang,Yiyang Huang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFT (Mask Fine-Tuning) applied to VLMs achieves better performance than LoRA and full fine-tuning by learning gating scores instead of updating weights, enabling structural reparameterization of existing knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM fine-tuning approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. The paper aims to explore more efficient adaptation by reorganizing existing knowledge rather than updating parameters.

Method: Applies Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) to vision-language models, specifically targeting language and projector components. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. This approach is grounded in structural reparameterization perspective.

Result: MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Experiments were conducted with different language backbones and compared against strong PEFT baselines.

Conclusion: Effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge. MFT provides a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for VLMs that outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

*Mohammad Nasirzadeh,Jafar Tahmoresnezhad,Parviz Rashidi-Khazaee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLog is a multimodal log anomaly detection framework that uses collaborative transformers and multi-head attention to handle different log modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ~99.6% F1 score across seven benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unimodal log anomaly detection methods ignore different log modalities, while multimodal methods fail to properly handle interactions between modalities. There's a need for a framework that can effectively leverage multiple log modalities and their interactions for comprehensive anomaly detection.

Method: CoLog uses collaborative transformers with multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among different log modalities. It incorporates a modality adaptation layer to handle heterogeneity between modalities, enabling learning of nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data.

Result: CoLog achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean precision of 99.63%, mean recall of 99.59%, and mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets. It effectively detects both point and collective anomalies, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated unified framework for both point and collective anomaly detection. It offers an effective solution for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency challenges in automatic log data analysis.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAMP is a stochastic temporal autoencoder with masked pretraining that learns temporally aware image representations for longitudinal medical data by conditioning on time differences between volumes and using variational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods like MAE lack temporal awareness needed to capture disease progression in longitudinal medical datasets, and deterministic approaches fail to account for uncertainty in disease evolution.

Method: STAMP uses a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on time differences between input volumes, reframing MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective.

Result: STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction tasks across OCT and MRI datasets.

Conclusion: STAMP successfully learns non-deterministic temporal dynamics of disease progression through stochastic temporal encoding, making it effective for longitudinal medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Temporally aware image representations are crucial for capturing disease progression in 3D volumes of longitudinal medical datasets. However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.

*Jianping Mei,Michael Moses,Jan Waelty,Yucheng Yang*

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: Deep learning improves art valuation by incorporating visual content, especially for first-time sales where historical data is lacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional art valuation methods rely heavily on artist identity and transaction history, but lack visual content analysis. The paper aims to explore whether deep learning can improve valuation by incorporating visual features of artworks.

Method: Used large repeated-sales dataset from major auction houses. Benchmarked classical hedonic regressions and tree-based methods against modern deep architectures, including multi-modal models that fuse tabular data (artist, history) with image data. Applied interpretability techniques like Grad-CAM and embedding visualizations.

Result: Artist identity and prior transaction history dominate overall predictive power, but visual embeddings provide distinct and economically meaningful contribution for fresh-to-market works where historical anchors are absent. Models attend to compositional and stylistic cues.

Conclusion: Multi-modal deep learning delivers significant value precisely when valuation is hardest (first-time sales), offering new insights for both academic research and practice in art market valuation.

Abstract: We study how deep learning can improve valuation in the art market by incorporating the visual content of artworks into predictive models. Using a large repeated-sales dataset from major auction houses, we benchmark classical hedonic regressions and tree-based methods against modern deep architectures, including multi-modal models that fuse tabular and image data. We find that while artist identity and prior transaction history dominate overall predictive power, visual embeddings provide a distinct and economically meaningful contribution for fresh-to-market works where historical anchors are absent. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and embedding visualizations show that models attend to compositional and stylistic cues. Our findings demonstrate that multi-modal deep learning delivers significant value precisely when valuation is hardest, namely first-time sales, and thus offers new insights for both academic research and practice in art market valuation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent2World is a tool-augmented multi-agent framework for generating symbolic world models (like PDDL domains) using multi-agent collaboration and interactive validation, achieving SOTA results and serving as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs to generate symbolic world models is limited by lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current static validation methods fail to catch behavior-level errors from interactive execution, creating a need for more robust, execution-aware validation approaches.

Method: Three-stage multi-agent pipeline: 1) Deep Researcher agent performs web search for knowledge synthesis to address specification gaps; 2) Model Developer agent implements executable world models; 3) Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation for interactive feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmarks spanning PDDL and executable code representations. Fine-tuning on multi-turn training trajectories yields average relative gain of 30.95% over baseline models.

Conclusion: Agent2World demonstrates that multi-agent collaboration with interactive validation enables both strong inference-time world-model generation and serves as an effective data engine for supervised fine-tuning, significantly improving world-model generation capabilities.

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

TL;DR: MCE introduces a monadic architecture for AI agents using Functors, Applicatives, and Monads to manage state, errors, and concurrency systematically, enabling robust composition and generative meta-agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent architectures use imperative, ad hoc patterns leading to brittle systems with poor state management, error handling, and concurrency issues.

Method: Proposes Monadic Context Engineering (MCE) leveraging algebraic structures: Monads for sequential composition, Applicatives for parallel execution, and Monad Transformers for systematic capability composition.

Result: Enables construction of complex, resilient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components, with extension to Meta-Agents for generative orchestration of sub-agent workflows.

Conclusion: MCE provides a formal foundation for agent design that systematically addresses cross-cutting concerns through algebraic abstractions, improving robustness and composability.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RW-Post, a high-quality explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking, and AgentFact, an agent-based framework that improves accuracy and interpretability through collaborative specialized agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fact-checking approaches have limitations in reasoning and evidence utilization due to lack of comprehensive datasets with annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence for real-world multimodal misinformation.

Method: 1) Created RW-Post dataset by aligning real-world multimodal claims with original social media posts and extracting detailed reasoning/evidence from human fact-checking articles using LLM-assisted pipeline. 2) Developed AgentFact framework with five specialized agents (strategy planning, evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, explanation generation) orchestrated through iterative workflow of evidence searching and task-aware filtering/reasoning.

Result: The synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking, as demonstrated through extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and agent-based framework address key bottlenecks in multimodal fact-checking by providing comprehensive real-world instances with reasoning annotations and enabling human-like verification workflows through collaborative specialized agents.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

Conclusion: CubeBench provides key insights into LLM limitations for physical-world deployment and offers a diagnostic framework to guide development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents by addressing spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.

TL;DR: HiR is a sample-efficient RL framework that replays failed attempts as successes by rewriting them based on satisfied constraints, enabling better learning from sparse rewards in complex instruction following tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for aligning LLMs struggle with sparse rewards because initial models often fail to generate responses satisfying all constraints, making it difficult to learn from failures.

Method: HiR uses a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on constraints satisfied in hindsight, then performs RL on both original and replayed samples using dual-preference learning at instruction- and response-level.

Result: Extensive experiments show HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks while requiring less computational budget compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: HiR provides an effective sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following by leveraging hindsight replay to overcome sparse reward challenges, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

TL;DR: Web World Model (WWM) bridges web frameworks and generative models by using web code for consistent world state/physics while LLMs handle context/narrative generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language agents need persistent worlds but current approaches are extreme: web frameworks offer reliability but fixed contexts, while generative models provide unlimited environments but lack controllability and practical engineering.

Method: WWM implements world state and physics in ordinary web code for logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. Built on realistic web stack with various applications including infinite travel atlas, galaxy explorers, and narrative worlds.

Result: Identified practical design principles: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and using deterministic generation for unlimited but structured exploration. Web stacks can serve as scalable substrate for world models.

Conclusion: Web World Model provides a middle ground between fixed web frameworks and fully generative models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments for language agents through web stack implementation.

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

TL;DR: M³ob: A multi-modal mobility prediction framework using LLM-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graphs to improve location recommendation by bridging semantic gaps between modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human mobility prediction methods have limited generalization: unimodal approaches suffer from data sparsity and biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to capture mobility dynamics due to semantic gaps between static multi-modal representations and spatial-temporal dynamics.

Method: 1) Construct unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) using LLM-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) to capture functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge. 2) Design gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations across modalities. 3) Propose STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into static image modality.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public datasets show consistent improvements in normal scenarios and significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

Conclusion: M³ob effectively leverages multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics, addressing limitations of existing methods and demonstrating strong performance and generalization for location recommendation.

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

### [294] [Memento-II: Learning by Stateful Reflective Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22716)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for continual learning in LLM agents that combines episodic memory with RL, using reflection as the key adaptation mechanism without backpropagation or fine-tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language model agents to adapt continually through interaction without requiring backpropagation or model fine-tuning, bridging the gap between training and deployment phases.

Method: Introduces Stateful Reflective Decision Process (SRDP) that models reflective learning as two-stage read-write interaction with episodic memory: writing stores outcomes (policy evaluation) and reading retrieves past cases (policy improvement). This induces an equivalent Markov Decision Process over augmented state-memory representations.

Result: The framework is instantiated using entropy-regularized policy iteration with convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient state space coverage, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution.

Conclusion: Provides a principled foundation for memory-augmented, retrieval-based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates, relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

### [295] [HiSciBench: A Hierarchical Multi-disciplinary Benchmark for Scientific Intelligence from Reading to Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22899)
*Yaping Zhang,Qixuan Zhang,Xingquan Zhang,Zhiyuan Chen,Wenwen Zhuang,Yupu Liang,Lu Xiang,Yang Zhao,Jiajun Zhang,Yu Zhou,Chengqing Zong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiSciBench is a hierarchical benchmark evaluating foundation models across five levels of scientific workflow, from basic literacy to discovery, across six disciplines with multimodal support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific AI benchmarks are fragmented and focus on narrow tasks, failing to reflect the hierarchical, multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry and the complete scientific workflow.

Method: Created HiSciBench with 8,735 curated instances across six scientific disciplines (math, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy) with five hierarchical levels: Scientific Literacy (L1), Literature Parsing (L2), Literature-based QA (L3), Literature Review Generation (L4), and Scientific Discovery (L5). Supports multimodal inputs (text, equations, figures, tables) and cross-lingual evaluation.

Result: Leading models (GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, multimodal systems) show substantial performance gaps: up to 69% accuracy on basic literacy tasks (L1), but performance declines sharply to 25% on discovery-level challenges (L5).

Conclusion: HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific intelligence, providing an integrated, dependency-aware framework for detailed diagnosis across scientific reasoning stages, offering actionable insights for developing more capable and reliable scientific AI models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.
