Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

*William Chen,Chutong Meng,Jiatong Shi,Martijn Bartelds,Shih-Heng Wang,Hsiu-Hsuan Wang,Rafael Mosquera,Sara Hincapie,Dan Jurafsky,Antonis Anastasopoulos,Hung-yi Lee,Karen Livescu,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge introduces a comprehensive test suite with 200+ languages, accents, and dialects to evaluate multilingual ASR models, resulting in submissions that significantly outperformed baselines with major improvements in LID accuracy and CER reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent multilingual ASR improvements have not been equally distributed across languages and language varieties, highlighting the need for more inclusive speech technologies that better serve diverse linguistic communities.

Method: Constructed a new test suite with data from 200+ languages, accents, and dialects, and introduced an online evaluation server based on DynaBench to allow flexible model design and architecture for participants.

Result: 5 submissions from 3 teams all outperformed baselines. The best submission achieved 23% absolute improvement in LID accuracy and 18% CER reduction on general multilingual test set, with 30.2% lower CER and 15.7% higher LID accuracy on accented/dialectal data.

Conclusion: Community challenges like ML-SUPERB 2.0 are crucial for advancing inclusive speech technologies and ensuring improvements benefit diverse language varieties, accents, and dialects equally.

Abstract: Recent improvements in multilingual ASR have not been equally distributed
across languages and language varieties. To advance state-of-the-art (SOTA) ASR
models, we present the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge. We construct a
new test suite that consists of data from 200+ languages, accents, and dialects
to evaluate SOTA multilingual speech models. The challenge also introduces an
online evaluation server based on DynaBench, allowing for flexibility in model
design and architecture for participants. The challenge received 5 submissions
from 3 teams, all of which outperformed our baselines. The best-performing
submission achieved an absolute improvement in LID accuracy of 23% and a
reduction in CER of 18% when compared to the best baseline on a general
multilingual test set. On accented and dialectal data, the best submission
obtained 30.2% lower CER and 15.7% higher LID accuracy, showing the importance
of community challenges in making speech technologies more inclusive.

### [3] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs to evaluate topic models across four quality dimensions, providing more interpretable and robust assessments than traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic model evaluation metrics like coherence and diversity only capture narrow statistical patterns and fail to detect semantic failures, limiting practical usefulness.

Method: Developed a purpose-oriented evaluation framework with nine LLM-based metrics covering lexical validity, intra-topic semantics, inter-topic structure, and document-topic alignment, validated through adversarial and sampling protocols.

Result: LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses like redundancy and semantic drift that traditional metrics miss.

Conclusion: The framework supports scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets, with all code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

### [4] [Towards EnergyGPT: A Large Language Model Specialized for the Energy Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07177)
*Amal Chebbi,Babajide Kolade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnergyGPT is a specialized LLM for the energy sector, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.1-8B, that outperforms general models in energy-specific tasks without requiring massive infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs lack effectiveness in specialized fields like energy that require deep technical expertise and precise domain knowledge.

Method: Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1-8B using Supervised Fine-Tuning on a curated energy-related corpus, with complete pipeline including data collection, model training, benchmark design, and evaluation.

Result: EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most energy-related language understanding and generation tasks on domain-specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized fine-tuning enables significant improvements in relevance and performance for technical fields like energy without large-scale infrastructure requirements.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

### [5] [DischargeSim: A Simulation Benchmark for Educational Doctor-Patient Communication at Discharge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07188)
*Zonghai Yao,Michael Sun,Won Seok Jang,Sunjae Kwon,Soie Kwon,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DischargeSim is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized discharge education through simulated doctor-patient conversations, assessing dialogue quality, document generation, and patient comprehension across diverse patient profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks focus on diagnostic reasoning but neglect post-visit patient education, which is critical for discharge communication and ongoing patient care.

Method: DischargeSim simulates multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with diverse psychosocial profiles across six clinical topics, evaluating through automatic metrics, LLM-as-judge, document generation, and comprehension tests.

Result: Experiments with 18 LLMs show significant gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across patient profiles and model size not consistently correlating with better outcomes.

Conclusion: DischargeSim provides the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in post-visit clinical education, highlighting the need for more equitable and personalized patient support systems.

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [6] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using rule-based moral principles (precaution, deference, responsibility) to handle uncertainty in LLM outputs, implemented via Prolog engine with plain-language rationales for transparent uncertainty communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic methods for uncertainty in LLMs are often opaque and misaligned with transparency expectations in high-stakes settings, requiring more ethical and interpretable approaches.

Method: Developed a framework based on moral psychology and virtue ethics principles, encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine that triggers system actions with plain-language rationales based on uncertainty levels (low, medium, high).

Result: Scenario-based simulations show improved rule coverage, fairness, and trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains demonstrate enhanced trust and interpretability through moral reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially responsible natural language generation, improving ethical handling of uncertainty in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [7] [LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07274)
*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively annotate complex political speech about migration solidarity in German parliamentary debates, showing high postwar solidarity and rising anti-solidarity since 2015.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual annotation of political speech about migration is time-consuming and limits analysis scope. LLMs offer potential for automating complex annotation tasks to study migration debates more comprehensively.

Method: Evaluated multiple LLMs for annotating (anti-)solidarity subtypes in German parliamentary debates, comparing with thousands of human annotations. Examined model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, and historical vs contemporary data performance.

Result: LLMs showed promise for political text analysis, with data revealing high migrant-directed solidarity in postwar period and strong anti-solidarity trend in German parliament since 2015.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable tools for political text analysis, enabling deeper insights into migration debates. Findings highlight Germany's complex migration landscape with demographic decline and labor shortages alongside rising polarization.

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

### [8] [Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07301)
*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE introduces lookahead keys that update token keys as context unfolds, enabling better information integration while preserving autoregressive properties, with efficient parallel training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard causal attention has static QKV that only encode preceding context, limiting information integration from future tokens.

Method: CASTLE continually updates each token's keys as context unfolds, creating lookahead keys that integrate information from later tokens while maintaining autoregressive property through mathematical equivalence for parallel training.

Result: Outperforms standard causal attention across model scales, reduces validation perplexity, and improves performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CASTLE provides an effective attention mechanism that enhances information integration while preserving autoregressive constraints and enabling efficient training.

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

### [9] [Basis Vector Metric: A Method for Robust Open-Ended State Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07308)
*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BVM method tested on MIT-States dataset for image state classification using language embeddings, outperforms other metrics for noun classification but doesn't beat logistic regression for adjective differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and test a new method (Basis Vectors Method) for judging state changes in images using language embeddings, and compare its performance against existing metrics.

Method: Used MIT-States dataset with 53K images, 225 nouns and 115 adjectives. Tested BVM against cosine similarity, dot product, product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and custom neural network for noun classification, and against logistic regression for adjective differentiation.

Result: BVM performed best among all metrics for classifying states for each noun class. However, for adjective differentiation, BVM did not conclusively outperform logistic regression model suggested by MIT-States paper.

Conclusion: BVM shows promise for noun state classification but needs methodological improvements to outperform existing approaches for adjective differentiation. Evidence suggests potential for accuracy improvements through methodology changes.

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

### [10] [Instance-level Performance Prediction for Long-form Generation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07309)
*Chi-Yang Hsu,Alexander Braylan,Yiheng Su,Omar Alonso,Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: New benchmark for predicting instance-level performance of long-form generation tasks with fine-grained metrics, requiring both point estimates and uncertainty intervals using minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for performance prediction in long-form generation tasks that have multi-faceted, fine-grained quality metrics, enabling better evaluation without extensive human annotation.

Method: Task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation that predicts continuous evaluation metric scores using only black-box model inputs and outputs, with prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Scores can be effectively predicted across 11 long-form datasets/tasks using as few as 16 training examples, with evaluation spanning multiple LLMs, baselines, and metrics per task.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel and useful task, provides a valuable benchmark to drive progress, and offers baselines ready for practical adoption in performance prediction for long-form generation.

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [11] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAMIR is a novel data selection method that uses model internal representations to identify less familiar training data, improving generalization performance across various NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT data selection methods are inefficient, costly, and sensitive to prompt variations. There's a need for a more robust approach that can work across diverse tasks without extensive prompt engineering.

Method: KAMIR computes similarities between hidden states at each layer and final hidden states to assess data familiarity. It uses a simple classifier to select less familiar data for training.

Result: Experiments show that training with less familiar data selected by KAMIR leads to better generalization performance across multiple task datasets.

Conclusion: KAMIR provides an effective, prompt-free approach for data selection that works across various NLP tasks and improves model generalization with smaller datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

### [12] [Mitigating Attention Localization in Small Scale: Self-Attention Refinement via One-step Belief Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07324)
*Nakyung Lee,Yeongoon Kim,Minhae Oh,Suhwan Kim,Jin Woo Koo,Hyewon Jo,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAOBP framework prevents attention collapse in transformers by injecting multi-hop relationships through belief propagation, improving long-range dependencies and model performance especially in small-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer self-attention often suffers from localization where attention collapses onto limited tokens, failing to capture long-range dependencies effectively.

Method: Propose Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP) that refines attention through belief propagation to inject multi-hop relationships, and introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) to quantify these interactions.

Result: SAOBP prevents entropy collapse in deeper layers, adaptively maintains appropriate GTD levels, and shows competitive performance gains particularly in small-scale models.

Conclusion: SAOBP effectively addresses attention localization issues, improves inference quality, and shows strong potential for resource-constrained scenarios through better long-range dependency modeling.

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

### [13] [PersonaFuse: A Personality Activation-Driven Framework for Enhancing Human-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07370)
*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse is a novel LLM post-training framework that enables language models to adapt and express different personalities for varying social contexts, improving emotional intelligence without sacrificing reasoning ability or safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world conversations, particularly in adapting communication style and emotional expression to different social and task contexts.

Method: Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and Big Five personality model, PersonaFuse uses a Mixture-of-Expert architecture combining persona adapters with dynamic routing network for contextual trait expression.

Result: Substantially outperforms baseline models across multiple social-emotional intelligence dimensions, achieves competitive response quality against leading LLMs like GPT-4o and DeepSeek despite smaller size, and improves downstream applications like mental health counseling and customer service.

Conclusion: PersonaFuse offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking significant advancement toward more human-centric AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

*Sankalp Tattwadarshi Swain,Anshika Krishnatray,Dhruv Kumar,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM agents fail to acquire a new constructed language (Tinkatongue) through interactive conversation within 100 responses, but show human-like learning strategies, suggesting new evaluation benchmarks and improved model designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation studies focus on vocabulary, syntax, and other linguistic aspects but don't assess whether LLMs can acquire language through pattern recognition and interactive feedback like humans do.

Method: A novel experimental framework where an LLM agent attempts to acquire and use a newly constructed language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that only understands Tinkatongue.

Result: LLM agents failed to establish successful conversation within 100 responses, but they adopted distinct strategies that mirror human approaches to language learning.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a new direction for evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that can learn more effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

### [15] [The Role of Exploration Modules in Small Language Models for Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07399)
*Yi-Jie Cheng,Oscar Chew,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using lightweight exploration modules to help small language models (SLMs) better traverse and reason over knowledge graphs for question answering, improving performance without requiring large proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-LLM integration methods rely on large proprietary models, limiting accessibility. Small language models struggle with KG traversal and reasoning, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Propose simple and efficient exploration modules that handle knowledge graph traversal instead of relying on the language model itself to perform this complex reasoning.

Result: Lightweight modules effectively improve SLM performance on knowledge graph question answering tasks, demonstrating better KG traversal and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Lightweight exploration modules provide an accessible and scalable solution for enhancing small language models' KG reasoning abilities, reducing reliance on large proprietary models.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

TL;DR: LongEmotion benchmark for long-context emotional intelligence tasks with 8,777 token average input length, featuring RAG and CoEM methods that outperform standard approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook emotional intelligence aspects in realistic long-context scenarios with lengthy, diverse, and noisy interactions.

Method: Developed LongEmotion benchmark with six EI tasks, introduced RAG using conversation context and LLM as retrieval sources, and CoEM method with five-stage task decomposition combining retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge injection.

Result: Both RAG and CoEM consistently enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs toward practical real-world EI applications.

Conclusion: The benchmark and proposed methods successfully address long-context emotional intelligence challenges, demonstrating significant improvements over standard approaches and enabling more realistic EI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

TL;DR: Multilingual XLM-RoBERTa-Large model achieves best performance for detecting positive supportive language (candy speech) in German YouTube comments through span-level training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of positive, supportive online communication (candy speech) is underexplored but important for fostering civility and enabling systematic analysis of its impact.

Method: Used monolingual (GBERT) and multilingual (Qwen3 Embedding, XLM-RoBERTa) language models on 46k German YouTube comments. Trained XLM-RoBERTa-Large at span level for candy speech detection.

Result: XLM-RoBERTa-Large outperformed other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1 (0.8906) and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) at GermEval 2025 Shared Task.

Conclusion: Span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers improve candy speech detection. Multilingual models are effective for identifying positive supportive language across languages.

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic review of healthcare stigmatizing language lexicons reveals moderate similarity but significant variations, with most terms being judgmental clinician expressions and predominantly negative sentiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stigmatizing language contributes to healthcare inequities, but there is no universally accepted standardized lexicon defining what constitutes stigmatizing language in healthcare settings.

Method: Conducted systematic literature search to identify existing stigmatizing language lexicons, then performed comparative analysis examining similarities/discrepancies and sentiment distribution using established sentiment datasets.

Result: Identified four lexicons showing moderate semantic similarity; most stigmatizing terms were judgmental expressions by clinicians describing perceived negative behaviors; sentiment analysis showed predominant negative classification with variations across lexicons.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for a standardized lexicon and reveal challenges in defining stigmatizing language in clinical texts, emphasizing the complexity of addressing healthcare language stigma.

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by source text in generative language models, ensuring safe deployment by identifying hallucinations in RAG pipeline outputs.

Method: Uses a universal feature set from two frozen NLI models and lexical signals to train a simple, calibrated meta-classifier with 5-fold out-of-fold training to prevent data leakage.

Result: Achieves strong OOF F1-scores: 0.7756 (summarization), 0.9786 (QA), and 0.7391 (dialogue) on HaluEval benchmark with well-calibrated probabilities enabling practical abstention.

Conclusion: HALT-RAG provides a flexible, task-adaptable framework for reliable hallucination detection, balancing model performance with safety requirements through calibrated probabilities and abstention mechanisms.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

TL;DR: ALLabel is a three-stage active learning framework that selects the most informative samples for LLM entity recognition, achieving comparable performance to full annotation with only 5-10% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the significant costs of fine-tuning LLMs for scientific entity recognition while maintaining high performance through efficient sample selection.

Method: Three-stage active learning framework that sequentially employs distinct strategies to select informative and representative samples for constructing demonstrations for LLM in-context learning.

Result: ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets, achieving performance comparable to full annotation with only 5-10% of data.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective and generalizable solution for cost-efficient LLM entity recognition in scientific domains through strategic sample selection.

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OS agents are designed for idealized settings, but real-world environments often present untrustworthy conditions that can lead to over-execution risks.

Method: A query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework with two-stage learning paradigm that decouples and utilizes meta-knowledge, allowing autonomous execution in normal conditions and human queries in untrustworthy scenarios.

Result: VeriOS-Agent improves average step-wise success rate by 20.64% in untrustworthy scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining normal performance.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates rationality, generalizability, and scalability, providing a trustworthy solution for OS agents operating in real-world untrustworthy environments.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRAKE method addresses edit skipping in RAG-based knowledge editing for multi-hop QA by using iterative retrieval with guided decomposition from single facts and entire cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge in LLMs becomes outdated quickly but retraining is costly. Existing RAG-based KE methods struggle with multi-hop QA due to edit skipping issues caused by natural language diversity and granularity mismatches.

Method: Proposes Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing (IRAKE) with guided decomposition using guidance from single edited facts and entire edited cases to prevent edit skipping.

Result: Experimental results show IRAKE mitigates edit skipping failures and outperforms state-of-the-art KE methods in multi-hop question answering tasks.

Conclusion: IRAKE effectively addresses the edit skipping problem in knowledge editing for complex multi-hop reasoning, providing a more robust solution than existing approaches.

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

TL;DR: BALI is a joint pre-training method that aligns biomedical language models with knowledge graphs to improve understanding of complex biomedical concepts and factual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical LLMs have limited comprehension of domain-specific concept structures and factual information from biomedical knowledge graphs, which hinders their performance on complex biomedical text understanding tasks.

Method: Proposes BALI - a joint LM and KG pre-training method that links biomedical concepts to UMLS KG, uses local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples, and simultaneously learns a KG encoder while aligning LM and graph representations.

Result: Implementation on leading biomedical LMs (PubMedBERT, BioLinkBERT) improves performance on language understanding tasks and entity representation quality, even with minimal pre-training on small alignment datasets from PubMed abstracts.

Conclusion: The BALI method effectively augments biomedical LMs with external knowledge through KG alignment, demonstrating improved performance across various biomedical language understanding tasks with efficient training requirements.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

*Libo Ren,Yee Man Ng,Lifeng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a perspective-aware iterative self-prompting (PA-ISP) method using LLMs for clinical report summarization, achieving high semantic similarity (BERTscore) despite lower lexical overlap (ROUGE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical reports are often lengthy and filled with jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to efficiently identify important aspects, which hinders effective patient-clinician communication and shared decision-making.

Method: Used Iterative Self-Prompting technique on LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-4o) to generate task-specific prompts and refine them via example-based few-shot learning. Employed ROUGE and BERT-score metrics to guide model fine-tuning across epochs.

Result: Achieved ROUGE scores of (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores of (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P, R, F1) on 3,396 clinical case reports. High BERTscore indicates semantically equivalent output summaries despite lower lexical overlap.

Conclusion: Perspective-aware ISP can be effectively deployed for clinical report summarization to support better communication between patients and clinicians, with semantic equivalence being more important than exact lexical matches.

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

*Xixi Wu,Yanchao Tan,Nan Hou,Ruiyang Zhang,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLoRAG is a logic-aware retrieval framework that combines semantic and logical relevance for multi-modal, multi-page document question answering, achieving significant improvements over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional document QA methods lose multi-modal information when converting to text, while LVLMs have input size constraints. RAG methods ignore logical connections between pages, which is essential for reasoning.

Method: Constructs a page graph to capture contextual relationships, uses lightweight VLM for graph traversal to retrieve semantically and logically relevant pages, then feeds top-K pages to LVLMs for QA. Offers training-free and fine-tuned variants.

Result: Experiments on four DocQA datasets show average improvements of 9.68% in accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over baselines.

Conclusion: MoLoRAG effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating both semantic and logical relevance, providing a flexible framework for multi-modal document understanding with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-BRe framework combines multi-class and binary classification approaches using three modules (Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, Label Decision) to efficiently extract high-quality training instances from unlabeled texts for relation extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for relation extraction is expensive due to scarcity of relevant sentences. LLMs struggle with comprehensive relation semantics in multi-class classification and face computational overhead in binary classification.

Method: Proposes M-BRe framework with three modules: Relation Grouping to organize relations, Relation Extraction to process texts, and Label Decision to combine advantages of both classification approaches.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled texts for relation extraction.

Conclusion: M-BRe effectively addresses LLM limitations in relation extraction by combining multi-class and binary classification benefits, providing an efficient solution for automated training data extraction.

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

*Rochana Prih Hastuti,Rian Adam Rajagede,Mansour Al Ghanim,Mengxin Zheng,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Watermarking in medical LLMs compromises factual accuracy, requiring domain-specific evaluation and new approaches to preserve medical integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are adapted to sensitive medical domains, their fluency raises safety risks regarding provenance and accountability. Watermarking is used to mitigate these risks but its reliability in medical contexts remains untested, particularly regarding factual accuracy in low-entropy settings.

Method: Proposed a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Used GPT-Judger and human validation to introduce Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite metric prioritizing factual accuracy over coherence.

Result: Current watermarking methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts degrading medical entity representation. The evaluation shows significant factual accuracy issues in watermarked medical content.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical content, as current methods fail to maintain factual accuracy in medical contexts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive benchmarking of LLMs for detecting fake news, harmful content, and political bias across 10 datasets and 5 languages, showing that fine-tuning outperforms in-context learning even with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the spread of fake news, polarizing content, and harmful information online by properly benchmarking large language models' performance across different models, usage methods, and languages.

Method: Tested various LLM adaptation paradigms including parameter-efficient fine-tuning and multiple in-context learning strategies (zero-shot, codebooks, few-shot with random/diverse selection, Chain-of-Thought) across 10 datasets in 5 languages for binary and multiclass classification.

Result: In-context learning often underperforms compared to fine-tuning, demonstrating that even smaller fine-tuned models outperform larger models using in-context learning approaches.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning smaller models on task-specific settings is more effective than using the largest models with in-context learning for detecting hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and political bias.

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms

*Decheng Duan,Yingyi Zhang,Jitong Peng,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciNLP is a new benchmark dataset for full-text entity and relation extraction in NLP domain, featuring 60 annotated papers with 7K+ entities and 1.8K+ relations, enabling knowledge graph construction and showing performance improvements over existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for scientific information extraction focus on specific publication sections due to domain complexity and high annotation costs, limiting comprehensive analysis of full scientific texts.

Method: Created SciNLP dataset with 60 manually annotated full-text NLP publications covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations, then conducted comparative experiments with state-of-the-art supervised models and cross-dataset evaluations.

Result: Results show varying extraction capabilities across text lengths, significant performance improvements on certain baseline models, and successful construction of a knowledge graph with average node degree of 3.2 per entity.

Conclusion: SciNLP is the first full-text annotation dataset for NLP domain that enables rich semantic knowledge graph construction and enhances downstream applications, publicly available for research use.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

*Xiaolin Chen,Xuemeng Song,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan,Xiangyu Zhao,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DK2R is a dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner that leverages both structured attribute knowledge and unstructured review knowledge with LLMs to improve textual response generation in multimodal task-oriented dialog systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal task-oriented dialog systems neglect unstructured review knowledge and underutilize large language models (LLMs), limiting their response generation capabilities.

Method: Proposes DK2R which: 1) extracts both structured and unstructured knowledge from external sources, 2) uses LLMs to evaluate knowledge utility through probe responses, 3) separately summarizes intention-oriented clues via dedicated reasoning, and 4) uses these as auxiliary signals for enhanced response generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed DK2R framework effectively addresses dynamic knowledge selection and intention-response decoupling challenges, demonstrating improved performance in multimodal dialog response generation by fully utilizing dual knowledge with LLMs.

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

### [32] [Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07829)
*Mihai Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF2 is a unified framework for English-Romanian literary translation that creates synthetic datasets and fine-tunes a 12B parameter open model, achieving competitive performance with proprietary models while being more cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of high-quality literary translation datasets for low-resource languages like Romanian and the challenge of literary translation by small open models.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning: instruction tuning for genre-specific narrative style and adapter compression for efficient deployment. Uses synthetic dataset generation and combines BLEU with LLM-based rubric evaluation.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with top proprietary models while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost-effective.

Conclusion: TF2 provides an end-to-end reproducible pipeline for cost-efficient translation and cross-lingual narrative generation, enabling broad adoption of open models for literary content in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

### [33] [Are Humans as Brittle as Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07869)
*Jiahui Li,Sean Papay,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Both humans and LLMs show sensitivity to prompt modifications, particularly with label set substitutions and format changes, but humans are less affected by typos and reversed label order than LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether human annotators show similar sensitivity to instruction changes as LLMs, and whether prompt brittleness in LLMs should be considered problematic or if it correctly reflects human annotation variances.

Method: Systematically compare effects of prompt modifications on both LLMs and human annotators using identical instruction modifications for text classification tasks with various prompt variations.

Result: Both humans and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness to specific prompt modifications (alternative label sets and label formats), but human judgments are less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than LLMs.

Conclusion: Prompt brittleness is not unique to LLMs - humans also show sensitivity to instruction changes, though the specific vulnerabilities differ between humans and models.

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

*Chengyan Wu,Yiqiang Cai,Yufei Cheng,Yun Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs with LoRA for Chinese gender bias detection, using balanced data, majority voting, and multi-temperature sampling to achieve 47.90% average score (4th place in NLPCC-2025 Shared Task 7).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To promote fairness and controllability in natural language generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias in Chinese sentences.

Method: Fine-tuning large language models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), constructing balanced training sets with heterogeneous samples, employing majority voting from multiple expert models, and implementing multi-temperature sampling for bias detection.

Result: Achieved an average score of 47.90% in bias detection, classification, and mitigation tasks, ranking fourth in the shared task competition.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effectiveness in addressing gender bias detection and mitigation challenges, though there is room for improvement as indicated by the fourth-place ranking.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Biased Tales dataset reveals significant gender and cultural stereotypes in LLM-generated children's stories, with 55.26% more appearance-focused attributes for female protagonists and disproportionate emphasis on heritage themes for non-Western characters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about cultural and gender stereotypes in LLM-generated bedtime stories as parents increasingly rely on AI for children's storytelling.

Method: Created Biased Tales dataset to analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in LLM-generated stories, comparing gender and cultural representations.

Result: Found 55.26% increase in appearance-related attributes for female protagonists compared to male ones. Non-Western children's stories disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes over Western children's stories.

Conclusion: Highlights the critical role of addressing sociocultural bias in AI to ensure more equitable and diverse creative AI applications, particularly in children's storytelling.

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs for parallel thinking through a progressive curriculum, achieving significant accuracy improvements on math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on supervised fine-tuning that encourages imitation rather than exploration, making it challenging to activate parallel thinking capabilities through training.

Method: A progressive curriculum combining SFT on easier tasks to instill parallel thinking ability, then transitioning to RL for exploration and generalization on harder problems.

Result: 8.4% accuracy improvement over sequential thinking models on challenging tasks, with a 42.9% improvement over baseline on AIME25. The model shifts from using parallel thinking for exploration to multi-perspective verification.

Conclusion: Parallel thinking serves as an effective mid-training exploration scaffold that unlocks higher performance ceilings after RL training, demonstrating successful parallel thinking capability development.

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

TL;DR: CellPainTR is a Transformer-based model that learns batch-effect-robust cellular morphology representations, enabling out-of-distribution generalization to unseen datasets without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous datasets, but technical batch effects and lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks.

Method: Transformer-based architecture with source-specific context tokens designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are robust to batch effects.

Result: Outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in batch integration and biological signal preservation on JUMP dataset. Maintains high performance on unseen Bray et al. dataset despite domain and feature shifts.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step towards creating truly foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and scalable cross-study biological analysis.

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal fusion architecture combining YOLOv8n and Vision Transformer with audio features improves railway defect detection accuracy by 0.2 points over vision-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single modality vision approaches for railway defect detection suffer from overdetection when structural elements appear similar to defects, requiring multimodal fusion with audio signals for better discrimination.

Method: Proposes a multimodal fusion architecture using YOLOv8n for object detection and Vision Transformer to combine feature maps from layers 7, 16, and 19 with synthesized audio representations for rail rupture and surface defect classes.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows 0.2 point improvement in precision and overall accuracy compared to vision-only approach, with statistical significance confirmed by Student's unpaired t-test.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion between audio and image modalities effectively enhances railway defect detection performance, reducing false positives and improving detection reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel post-hoc OOD detection method called ClaFR that uses classifier weight decomposition to create class-known subspaces and measures feature reconstruction error without requiring training data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-based OOD detection methods often require access to training data, which poses privacy concerns. There's a need for effective OOD detection that works without accessing the original training data.

Method: ClaFR performs orthogonal decomposition of classifier weights to extract class-known subspaces, maps original data features into these subspaces, and calculates OOD scores based on feature reconstruction error within the subspace.

Result: The method achieves leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks without requiring access to training data, outperforming existing OOD detection algorithms.

Conclusion: ClaFR provides a simple yet effective privacy-preserving solution for OOD detection that eliminates the need for training data access while maintaining high detection performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

TL;DR: DIET-CP is a simple continued pretraining strategy that adapts foundation models to new domains using small datasets without requiring hyperparameter search or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains often have very small datasets that limit SSL methods and make hyperparameter search infeasible, while pretrained models lack important information for continued pretraining.

Method: Uses a very simple objective that requires no labels and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning, steering foundation models toward new data distributions.

Result: Provides significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models like DINOv3 using only 1000 images, stable across data modalities and backbone choices.

Conclusion: DIET-CP effectively bridges the gap for continued pretraining in specialized domains with small datasets, offering a simple and stable solution.

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT enhances adversarial robustness in Federated Prompt Tuning by addressing class information gaps through a class-aware prompt generator guided by global label embeddings and cross-layer generator sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Prompt Tuning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially under non-IID settings where clients have limited local label information while the global model faces attacks from global labels.

Method: Proposes a class-aware prompt generator that creates visual prompts from text prompts using Global Label Embedding as guidance, plus cross-layer generator sharing strategy to enhance prompt coupling across model layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedAPT significantly outperforms existing methods in adversarial robustness and demonstrates exceptional generalization in cross-domain and cross-dataset scenarios.

Conclusion: FedAPT effectively addresses the class information gap in federated learning and provides superior adversarial robustness, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD framework bridges the gap between academic VLM evaluation and enterprise needs by testing on 10 real-world business tasks using a novel OCR comparison algorithm and comprehensive metrics on 7,500 real samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks use synthetic data and multiple-choice questions that don't reflect real enterprise deployment requirements like social media content analysis.

Method: Developed ViLD framework with 10 business-critical tasks, BlockWeaver Algorithm for OCR comparison, and combined semantic matching, traditional metrics, and novel methods to evaluate completeness/faithfulness on 7,500 real-world samples.

Result: Benchmarked leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, InternVL) against proprietary baseline, providing industry-grounded assessment of capabilities for enterprise deployment.

Conclusion: ViLD offers actionable insights for enterprise VLM deployment by providing comprehensive evaluation framework that addresses real-world business requirements beyond academic benchmarks.

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [46] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome is a self-supervised learning system that uses DICOM headers to improve medical image analysis, achieving AUROC 0.901 and better calibration across CT, MRI, and CXR modalities from multiple vendors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical imaging through PACS/DICOM contains procedure choices that create latent confounders affecting image quality, which impede generalization of image-only networks across different sites and scanners.

Method: Uses structured DICOM headers as labels with three learning approaches: protocol-image contrastive learning, masked protocol prediction, and protocol-protocol translation. Processes 1.26M studies from 7 health systems with 31 scanners and 3 vendors.

Result: Achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs 0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on external validation. Shows significant improvements in chest CT PE triage (+0.046), brain MRI glioma grading (+0.058), and chest radiograph cardiomegaly detection (+0.041) with 25-37% calibration improvements.

Conclusion: Protocol Genome provides clinically robust image representations that reduce false positives at protocol borders, works with limited labeled data (10-20%), and is deployable in clinical PACS systems with proper de-identification and bias audits.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision language models struggle with fragmented, fused, or occluded text that humans can easily read, revealing structural limitations in handling writing system perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether advanced vision language models share human resilience in recognizing words despite character fragmentation, fusion, or occlusion across different writing systems.

Method: Constructed two psychophysics-inspired benchmarks using Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to create 'visible but unreadable' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans.

Result: Contemporary VLMs show severe performance drops under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs, indicating they rely heavily on generic visual invariances but underutilize compositional priors needed for robust literacy.

Conclusion: The findings motivate new architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction that performs feature-level learning in the frequency domain using temporal fusion strategies to synthesize k-space data, enabling robust reconstruction even with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic cardiac MRI faces challenges due to scarce and low-quality k-space data in practice, which hampers robust reconstruction. Traditional methods using pixel-level convolution in image domain struggle with data scarcity.

Method: Feature-level learning directly in frequency domain leveraging Fourier transform's global representation capacity. Uses temporal-fusion strategies to integrate k-space data across time frames and optimize generative trajectory.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate strong generative ability in low-data regimes, showing practical potential to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Conclusion: Frequency domain feature-level modeling with temporal fusion enables stable and rich k-space data generation even with ultra low-data availability, offering a promising solution for dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction challenges.

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Models struggle to generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and perceptually dissimilar categories, showing sharp performance drops when tested on unrelated object types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to conceptually distant categories, beyond narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains.

Method: Introduced train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation between training and test sets using LLM-driven semantic grouping, embedding similarity thresholding, clustering, and supercategory-based partitioning.

Result: Results show a sharp performance drop as correlation between training and test categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Clustering yielded the most effective trade-off.

Conclusion: Current models have limitations in attribute reasoning across dissimilar categories, and these findings inform future benchmark construction for more robust attribute generalization.

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop framework for quantitative evaluation of LLM-generated 3D models with comprehensive metrics including volumetric accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models can interpret multimodal inputs to generate 3D shapes, but robust evaluation methods for geometric and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped.

Method: Proposed a comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references, using an L-bracket component as case study across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches, geometric structure trees, and code-based correction prompts.

Result: Improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with code-level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. Quantitative evaluation enables significantly faster convergence toward ground truth compared to traditional qualitative methods.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of AI-assisted shape synthesis and provides a scalable methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

*Jiarui Chen,Yikeng Chen,Yingshuang Zou,Ye Huang,Peng Wang,Yuan Liu,Yujing Sun,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS² is a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reduces VRAM usage by 50% for static memory and 40% for rendering memory while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS has high memory consumption that limits its use on edge devices, and existing compression methods focus on storage rather than rendering memory bottlenecks.

Method: Replaces memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight spherical Gaussian lobes for color representation, and introduces a unified soft pruning framework that jointly optimizes primitive number and lobe number as a constrained optimization problem.

Result: Achieves 50% static VRAM reduction and 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: MEGS² successfully addresses the critical memory bottleneck in 3DGS rendering through joint optimization of primitive count and parameter efficiency, enabling more practical deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

*Jisung Hwang,Jaihoon Kim,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussian distribution in latent spaces, combining moment-based spatial regularization with power spectrum-based spectral regularization for improved downstream optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate downstream optimization tasks in text-to-image models by ensuring latent space samples follow standard Gaussian distribution, preventing reward hacking and improving convergence.

Method: Treats high-dimensional sample elements as 1D Gaussian variables, uses composite loss with moment regularization (spatial domain) and power spectrum regularization (spectral domain) with random permutation for invariance.

Result: Outperforms previous Gaussianity regularization methods, effectively prevents reward hacking, and accelerates convergence in test-time reward alignment for aesthetics and text alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework provides an effective regularization approach that combines spatial and spectral domain constraints for better Gaussian distribution enforcement in latent spaces.

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

TL;DR: A reward function-based optimization method for fine-tuning foundational segmentation models like SAM, enabling real-time streaming data analysis in microscopy by incorporating physics-based criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational segmentation models have too many non-transparent tuning parameters requiring manual optimization, limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis in microscopy applications.

Method: Introduces reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models (specifically SAM), where reward functions represent physics of the imaged system including particle size distributions, geometries, and other criteria.

Result: Developed SAM* - an optimized variant of SAM that shows enhanced adaptability and performance, particularly enabling real-time streaming data segmentation in microscopy imaging.

Conclusion: The reward-driven optimization framework successfully improves foundational models' alignment with diverse segmentation task requirements and enables real-time analysis capabilities for microscopy applications.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aymara benchmark reveals LMMs systematically amplify gender stereotypes in image generation, showing 93% male representation in male-stereotyped jobs vs 22.5% in female-stereotyped, with significant model variation indicating bias is not inevitable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address methodological limitations in prior gender bias research and provide large-scale, comparable cross-model analysis of social bias in AI-generated images from commercial LMMs.

Method: Created Aymara benchmark with 75 gender-neutral prompts for stereotypical/non-stereotypical professions, tested 13 commercial LMMs, generated 965 images, and used validated LLM-as-judge system for gender representation scoring.

Result: LMMs amplify occupational stereotypes (93% male in male-stereotyped vs 22.5% in female-stereotyped), show default-male bias (68.3% male in non-stereotyped), with model variation from 46.7% to 73.3% male representation.

Conclusion: High bias is not inevitable but a design choice consequence; standardized automated evaluation tools are necessary for AI fairness accountability, with top-performing model demonstrating de-amplification of stereotypes and near gender parity.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: Proposes block-sparse attention kernels to replace dense global attention in transformer-based multi-view reconstruction models, achieving 4x faster inference without retraining while maintaining comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models like VGGT and π³ face runtime bottlenecks due to quadratic complexity of global attention layers, limiting scalability to large image sets. Analysis shows attention concentrates on a small subset of geometrically relevant patch-patch interactions.

Method: Replace dense global attention with optimized block-sparse kernels based on empirical observation that attention probability mass concentrates on cross-view geometric matches. Requires no retraining of backbone models.

Result: Achieves up to 4x faster inference with comparable task performance. Supports both VGGT and π³ models and large image collections. Validated on comprehensive multi-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: Block-sparse attention kernels effectively address runtime bottlenecks in transformer-based multi-view reconstruction while maintaining performance, enabling scalability to larger image sets without model retraining.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers creates security vulnerabilities where subtle pose spoofing attacks can accumulate into substantial drift while evading existing heuristic checks

Method: Proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal regularities of motion patterns, enabling detection of runtime deviations and initiating recovery mechanisms to restore pose consistency

Result: Experimental evaluation using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities shows substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to no-defense baseline

Conclusion: The unsupervised, label-free approach effectively detects and recovers from VIO spoofing attacks in offloaded edge computing environments, enhancing security for immersive VR applications

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

*Erencem Ozbey,Dimitrios I. Diochnos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully unsupervised approach for novel class discovery in image classification using Vision Transformers and manifold learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets without requiring known cluster counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning requires extensive human labeling effort, and real-world applications often encounter novel classes that weren't present during initial training. Existing approaches focus on semi-supervised methods, but there's a need for fully unsupervised solutions to identify novel categories.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers with attention mechanisms to generate vector embeddings, incorporates manifold learning techniques to refine embeddings by exploiting data geometry, and estimates the number of clusters automatically.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art results on single-modal clustering and Novel Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet, working effectively both when cluster numbers are known and unknown.

Conclusion: The proposed fully unsupervised approach successfully addresses novel class discovery in image classification, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating robustness across various datasets without requiring prior knowledge of cluster counts.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [60] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet is a dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal model for breast ultrasound segmentation that combines global image semantics with local boundary precision using text prompts from clinical metadata, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the BLU dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast ultrasound segmentation is challenging for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle noise. Existing text-image approaches produce coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries without additional edge recovery mechanisms.

Method: XBusNet uses a dual-branch architecture: a global pathway with CLIP Vision Transformer for whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size/location, and a local U-Net pathway for precise boundaries modulated by text prompts describing shape, margin, and BI-RADS terms. Prompts are automatically assembled from structured metadata without manual input.

Result: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean Dice of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149 on BLU dataset, outperforming six baselines. Small lesions show largest gains with fewer missed regions and spurious activations. Ablations confirm complementary contributions of global context, local modeling, and prompt modulation.

Conclusion: The dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design effectively merges global semantics with local precision, yielding accurate breast ultrasound segmentation masks and improved robustness for small, low-contrast lesions.

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using Diffusion Probabilistic Model for data augmentation and feature fusion achieves 98% accuracy in breast cancer classification from thermograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in medical imaging hinders deep learning applications, particularly for breast cancer classification using thermograms.

Method: Uses DPM for superior data augmentation, fuses deep features from ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (Fractal Dimension) from U-Net segmented tumors, and employs XGBoost classifier.

Result: Achieves 98.0% accuracy and 98.1% sensitivity, with ablation studies confirming statistical significance of both DPM augmentation and feature fusion.

Conclusion: Validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

*Ji Xie,Trevor Darrell,Luke Zettlemoyer,XuDong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecA is a resource-efficient post-training method that uses visual understanding embeddings as dense text prompts to improve multimodal models' generation and editing fidelity without captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional training relies on sparse image-text pairs that miss fine-grained visual details, limiting the alignment between visual understanding and generation in unified multimodal models.

Method: RecA conditions UMMs on their own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes them to reconstruct input images using self-supervised reconstruction loss, realigning understanding and generation capabilities.

Result: With only 27 GPU-hours, RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73→0.90) and DPGBench (80.93→88.15), while boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25).

Conclusion: RecA is an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy that works across diverse UMM architectures, surpassing larger open-source models and improving both generation and editing fidelity.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

### [63] [DEPF: A UAV Multispectral Object Detector with Dual-Domain Enhancement and Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07327)
*Shucong Li,Zhenyu Liu,Zijie Hong,Zhiheng Zhou,Xianghai Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel UAV multispectral object detector called DEPF is proposed to address challenges in low-light image enhancement, local target modeling, and computational efficiency using dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three key challenges in UAV multispectral object detection: reduced complementarity in low-light conditions, interference from redundant information during fusion, and the computational complexity limitations of transformer-based methods on UAV platforms.

Method: Proposes DEPF with two main modules: 1) Dual-Domain Enhancement Module (DDE) with Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba for global brightness enhancement and Fourier Details Recovery for texture-detail recovery; 2) Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) that uses priority scanning starting from local target features based on modality difference scores.

Result: Experiments on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets show that DEPF performs well on object detection tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DEPF framework effectively addresses the challenges of multispectral UAV object detection by leveraging Mamba's linear complexity and dual-domain enhancement, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

*Haiqing Ren,Zhongkai Luo,Heng Fan,Xiaohui Yuan,Guanchen Wang,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: G^3CN - a novel GCN approach using Gaussian topology refinement and GRU gates to better distinguish ambiguous actions in skeleton-based recognition


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GCNs struggle with ambiguous action recognition due to limitations in representing topological and spatial features

Method: Incorporates Gaussian filter to refine skeleton topology graph and integrates GRUs into GCN framework to enhance information propagation between skeleton points

Result: Shows strong generalization across GCN backbones and demonstrates effectiveness on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks, particularly for ambiguous samples

Conclusion: G^3CN effectively improves action recognition performance by addressing the challenge of distinguishing ambiguous actions through topology refinement and enhanced information propagation

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

*Shibang Liu,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGVL introduces a novel Guided Module for visual-language fusion in human pose estimation, using parse graphs to maintain occluded region responses through hierarchical cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual-language fusion methods weaken occluded region responses and cause alignment failures in human pose estimation, ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion with language priors.

Method: Parse Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with Guided Module, using top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition with recursive bidirectional cross-attention purified by GM.

Result: Validated on major pose estimation datasets, showing improved performance in handling occluded scenes.

Conclusion: PGVL effectively fuses visual and language information for better human pose estimation, particularly in occluded scenarios, with code to be released.

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

*Ze-Xin Yin,Jiaxiong Qiu,Liu Liu,Xinjie Wang,Wei Sui,Zhizhong Su,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGAA is a novel framework for end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation that unifies geometry and material modeling using multi-view diffusion priors, achieving efficient training with only 69k multi-view instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D asset creation with PBR materials is labor-intensive, and existing 3D generation methods either focus only on geometry or leave texture synthesis as post-processing, lacking end-to-end PBR-ready solutions.

Method: Modular framework with three components: LGAA Wrapper (reuses MV diffusion model layers), LGAA Switcher (aligns multiple diffusion priors), and LGAA Decoder (tamed VAE for 2D Gaussian Splatting with PBR channels), plus post-processing for mesh extraction.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with both text- and image-conditioned multi-view diffusion models, enabling high-quality relightable mesh assets.

Conclusion: LGAA provides an efficient end-to-end solution for PBR-ready 3D asset generation, with flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors and knowledge-preserving training that converges effectively on limited data.

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoGazeVQA is a new benchmark for egocentric gaze-guided video question answering that uses gaze information to improve understanding of daily-life videos and user intent interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLM benchmarks overlook gaze as a crucial indicator of user intent in egocentric videos, which capture user focus, actions, and context in a unified coordinate system for proactive AI experiences.

Method: Created EgoGazeVQA benchmark with gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Developed gaze-guided intent prompting methods integrating spatial, temporal, and intent cues, and conducted gaze-related fine-tuning experiments.

Result: Existing MLLMs struggle to interpret user intentions accurately. Gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance. Gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness.

Conclusion: Gaze information is valuable for creating more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings, enabling better understanding of user intent through spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLEAM introduces a comprehensive cross-view geo-localization framework with GLEAM-C for multi-modal alignment and GLEAM-X for explainable reasoning, addressing limitations of traditional single-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL approaches are restricted to single views/modalities and lack interpretability - they only predict matches without explaining the rationale behind correspondences.

Method: GLEAM-C aligns multiple views (UAV, street maps, panoramas, ground photos) with satellite imagery using optimized implementation and two-phase training. GLEAM-X leverages MLLMs for explainable reasoning and creates a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro with human-refined test data.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific models while enhancing training efficiency and providing interpretable correspondence analysis through the new explainable reasoning task.

Conclusion: GLEAM forms a complete CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal alignment with interpretable analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning to advance geo-localization transparency and scalability.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

TL;DR: XOCT is a deep learning framework that uses cross-dimensional supervision and multi-scale feature fusion for layer-aware OCT-to-OCTA translation, improving vascular reconstruction quality for retinal disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations in acquiring high-quality OCTA images due to motion sensitivity, high costs, and current deep learning methods' inability to capture vascular differences across retinal layers and intricate vascular details.

Method: Proposes XOCT framework with Cross-Dimensional Supervision (CDS) using 2D layer-wise en-face projections as supervisory signals, and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network with channel reweighting for multi-scale feature extraction.

Result: Experiments on OCTA-500 dataset show significant improvements in en-face projections, which are crucial for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies.

Conclusion: XOCT enhances OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning effectively reduces model bias by selectively removing biased samples/features using techniques like Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation, achieving up to 97.37% fairness improvement with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data, leading to biased predictions in safety-critical domains. Conventional bias mitigation requires costly retraining or pipeline redesign, creating need for post-hoc correction methods.

Method: Leverages privacy-preserving unlearning techniques including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation to selectively remove biased samples or feature representations. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets: CUB-200-2011 (pose bias), CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection).

Result: Substantially reduced subgroup disparities with improvements in demographic parity of up to 94.86% on CUB-200, 30.28% on CIFAR-10, and 97.37% on CelebA. Achieved with minimal accuracy loss and average score of 0.62 across utility, fairness, quality, and privacy metrics.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning establishes as a practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without requiring full retraining, providing an effective post-hoc solution for bias mitigation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Method: Leverages pre-trained diffusion models in a zero-shot setting, integrating temporal priors from video diffusion models with relighting capabilities from image diffusion models. Uses a Refinement Projection Algorithm for pixel-level detail manipulation to ensure foreground consistency.

Result: Achieves high-quality video background replacement with precise foreground preservation and temporally coherent relighting on consumer-grade GPUs, demonstrating practical efficiency.

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL provides a training-free, efficient solution for video content creation and editing that overcomes foreground consistency and relighting challenges while maintaining high quality results.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedicalPatchNet is a self-explainable chest X-ray classification model that splits images into patches, classifies each patch independently, and aggregates predictions to provide transparent region-based explanations without post-hoc techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for radiological image classification often lack interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. There's a need for inherently explainable models that can transparently attribute decisions to specific image regions.

Method: The architecture splits chest X-ray images into non-overlapping patches, independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions. This enables intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without requiring post-hoc explanation techniques.

*Wenshuo Gao,Xicheng Lan,Luyao Zhang,Shuai Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method that combines implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models to automate vector graphic animation, preserving scalability and precision while generating smooth, high-quality animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics offer scalability and user-friendliness but animating them requires substantial manual effort. Existing techniques have limitations in flexibility and animation quality, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: Uses layered implicit neural representations to reconstruct vector graphics while preserving their properties, then optimizes with video score distillation sampling from pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to leverage motion priors, and finally warps vector graphics to match the representations.

Result: Experimental results show the method effectively generates vivid and natural vector graphic animations with significant improvement over existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the domain gap between vector graphics and diffusion models, enabling automated generation of high-quality vector animations that maintain the inherent benefits of vector graphics.

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional navigation systems fail indoors due to lack of precise location data. The paper aims to assist visually impaired individuals by providing accessible indoor navigation using vision and language models.

Method: Fine-tuned BLIP-2 model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. Proposed a refined evaluation metric based on BERT F1 score that emphasizes directional and sequential variables.

Result: After applying LoRA, the model showed significant improvement in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations of the original BLIP-2 model.

Conclusion: The integrated vision-language approach successfully enhances indoor navigation accessibility for visually impaired individuals through improved directional instruction generation.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original

*Wenzhi Guo,Bing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGS integrates Signed Distance Field learning into 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve surface reconstruction while maintaining high rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS achieves photorealistic view synthesis but struggles with accurate and complete surface reconstruction due to its unstructured nature and lack of explicit geometric supervision.

Method: Associates each Gaussian with a learnable SDF value to align primitives with geometry, and uses geometry-guided grid growth strategy for adaptive Gaussian distribution along geometry-consistent regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks&Temples benchmarks show consistent improvements in reconstruction accuracy and completeness while preserving high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: DiGS successfully bridges the gap between high-quality rendering and accurate surface reconstruction in 3DGS by incorporating SDF learning, providing strong geometric priors and improved cross-view consistency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

### [76] [Generating Transferrable Adversarial Examples via Local Mixing and Logits Optimization for Remote Sensing Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07495)
*Chun Liu,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel adversarial attack framework using local mixing and logits optimization to enhance transferability while preserving semantic features and avoiding gradient vanishing issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in remote sensing applications. Current mixing-based strategies destroy global semantic features and suffer from gradient diminishing during iterative updates.

Method: 1) Local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent inputs by blending local regions only. 2) Adapts logit loss from targeted to non-targeted attacks to mitigate gradient vanishing. 3) Applies perturbation smoothing loss to suppress high-frequency noise.

Result: Achieves superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. With ResNet on MTARSI, achieves 17.28% average improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by preserving semantic information and optimizing gradients, demonstrating significant improvements in adversarial attack transferability.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

*Saad Lahlali,Alexandre Fournier Montgieux,Nicolas Granger,Hervé Le Borgne,Quoc Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAT is a weakly supervised 3D object detection framework that uses temporal multi-view data and teacher-student distillation to achieve state-of-the-art performance without 3D box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data annotation is costly, and existing weakly supervised methods using only 2D boxes suffer from projection ambiguities and partial visibility issues in single viewpoint settings.

Method: Leverages temporal multi-view data to aggregate object-centric point clouds across time, uses teacher-student distillation where the teacher learns from single viewpoints with targets from temporally aggregated static objects, and employs multi-view 2D projection loss for consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets, significantly narrowing the gap with fully supervised methods without requiring 3D box annotations.

Conclusion: MVAT effectively addresses projection ambiguities and partial visibility challenges in weakly supervised 3D object detection through temporal multi-view aggregation and distillation, demonstrating strong performance comparable to fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal variations, and existing datasets lack multimodal/multi-view diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and action quality components needed for clinical assessment of hand dexterity.

Method: Created EHWGesture dataset with over 1,100 recordings (6 hours) from 25 healthy subjects using two RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera, with motion capture system providing precise hand landmark tracking. All devices spatially calibrated and synchronized for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Dataset organized with classes of execution speed mirroring clinical evaluations. Baseline experiments demonstrate potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger detection, and action quality assessment tasks.

Conclusion: EHWGesture serves as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture understanding, addressing limitations of existing datasets and enabling research in gesture classification, detection, and quality assessment.

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UFC is a universal few-shot control adapter that enables text-to-image diffusion models to generalize to novel spatial control conditions with minimal training data (30 examples), achieving competitive performance with fully supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial control adapters for diffusion models have limited adaptability and require high training costs when encountering novel control conditions that differ from training tasks.

Method: UFC leverages analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features through a matching mechanism and updates on a small set of task-specific parameters, working with few image-condition pairs.

Result: Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show UFC achieves fine-grained control with only 30 annotated examples, and with 0.1% of full training data, it matches performance of fully supervised baselines across various control tasks.

Conclusion: UFC provides an effective few-shot solution for spatial conditioning in diffusion models, demonstrating generalization to novel tasks and compatibility with different diffusion backbones (UNet and DiT).

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: Enhanced Masked Image Modeling for 3D medical images using HU-based Foreground Masking that focuses on diagnostically relevant tissue regions instead of random masking, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional random masking in MIM overlooks the density of anatomical objects in 3D medical imaging, failing to focus on diagnostically meaningful regions while including non-tissue areas like air and fluid.

Method: Proposed HU-based Foreground Masking strategy that leverages Hounsfield Unit measurements to focus on intensity distribution of visceral organs and exclude non-tissue regions lacking meaningful features.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across five public 3D medical imaging datasets with Dice scores: BTCV:~84.64%, Flare22:~92.43%, MM-WHS:~90.67%, Amos22:~88.64%, BraTS:~78.55%.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the importance of domain-centric MIM approaches and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image segmentation, with implementation available publicly.

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM

Motivation: Document images contain rich knowledge and spoken queries enable flexible applications, but no prior work has explored speech-based QA over visual documents without text conversion.

Method: End-to-end framework that directly interprets speech, retrieves relevant visual knowledge from documents, and generates answers without ASR/TTS/OCR. Includes layout-aware reranking to refine retrieval.

Result: Substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to prior methods. Also releases the first bilingual speech-document RAG dataset with Chinese and English voice queries.

Conclusion: TextlessRAG demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of fully textless speech-based document QA, providing a new direction for multimodal information retrieval and setting a foundation for future research with released dataset and pipeline.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the

directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, which are slow for inference. There's also a lack of large-scale 3D head assets for training.

Method: Coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline using FLAME model sparse points with transformer blocks for feature extraction. Dual-branch framework aggregates spherical triplane features and point-based features. Trained on synthetic data from 3D GANs.

Result: Framework enables fast reconstruction and rendering in a single forward pass, achieving effective Gaussian head reconstruction from single unposed images.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and effective solution for full-head synthesis, outperforming existing work with faster inference and high-fidelity results using only synthetic training data.

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

TL;DR: CGAT architecture for transparent 3D shape recognition using graph attention with explainable attention maps, applied to dental age estimation from CBCT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the black-box nature of deep learning models in high-stakes applications like medicine and forensics by creating transparent and trustworthy 3D shape recognition models.

Method: Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) with graph attention convolutions and attention rollout visualization, using local mean curvature and distance to centroid as node features, with directed edges to global CLS node.

Result: Models achieved 0.76 weighted F1 score with combined node features, producing more intuitive attention maps and better classification performance compared to individual features.

Conclusion: CGAT provides human-understandable explanations through attention maps, enhancing trust and validation for high-stakes applications, with broad applicability beyond dental data to graph-based classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a thorough overview of temporal image forensics techniques that estimate image age using time-dependent traces from acquisition pipelines, while addressing critical issues like content bias and verifying the reliability of existing methods.

Method: Analysis and review of previous works, re-implementation of methods when required, experimental verification of sensor defect properties (growth rate and spatial distribution), investigation of neural network feature learning, and demonstration of how neural networks can be distracted from learning age traces.

Result: The review verifies properties of known age traces, shows that some methods claiming to use sensor defects actually exploit content bias, investigates features learned by neural networks for dating images, and demonstrates neural network vulnerability to distraction from learning true age traces.

Conclusion: This comprehensive review highlights the importance of eXplainable AI methods for verifying temporal image forensics techniques, proposes a more realistic forensic setting, and emphasizes the need to address content bias issues to ensure reliable image age estimation.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender bias evaluation benchmarks contain spurious correlations that may distort true gender bias measurements, raising concerns about the reliability of current assessment methods.

Method: Systematically perturb non-gender features across four benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify impact on bias evaluation through masking objects and blurring backgrounds.

Result: Minimal perturbations (10% object masking or weak background blurring) can dramatically alter bias scores by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in CLIP variants, showing current evaluations reflect spurious feature responses rather than true gender bias.

Conclusion: Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is challenging, researchers should report bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity measurements for more reliable gender bias assessment in VLMs.

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

*Fangqi Cheng,Surajit Ray,Xiaochen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline for 3D CT-based Med-VLMs adapted for 3D MRI, achieving SOTA performance in Alzheimer's diagnosis with only 1,500 training images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Med-VLMs underutilize patient metadata, lack clinical diagnostic knowledge integration, require extensive computational resources, and have limited effectiveness on 3D medical imaging due to missing structural information.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Convert structured metadata into synthetic reports for better image-text alignment, 2) Add auxiliary token trained to predict MMSE scores for additional supervision. Uses lightweight prompt tuning on both image and text modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two Alzheimer's disease datasets using only 1,500 training images, outperforming methods fine-tuned on 10,000 images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of current Med-VLMs by efficiently utilizing metadata, integrating clinical knowledge, and enabling effective adaptation to 3D MRI with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed self-supervised cross-encoder framework for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis from MRI that disentangles static and dynamic representations using temporal continuity in longitudinal scans, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing deep learning methods that rely heavily on large labeled datasets and produce uninterpretable representations for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis from MRI data.

Method: Self-supervised cross-encoder framework leveraging temporal continuity in longitudinal MRI scans. Uses contrastive learning for static representations (stable anatomical features) and input-gradient regularization for dynamic representations (temporal changes).

Result: Achieved superior classification accuracy on ADNI dataset, improved interpretability, strong zero-shot generalization on OASIS dataset, and cross-task generalization on PPMI dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data labeling dependency and interpretability issues in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

*Sung Ju Lee,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW) to maintain frequency integrity and improve robustness against regeneration and cropping attacks in latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic watermarking techniques for LDMs suffer from detection performance degradation due to loss of frequency integrity and vulnerability to cropping attacks.

Method: Introduces SFW that enforces Hermitian symmetry to maintain frequency integrity and a center-aware embedding strategy to reduce cropping vulnerability by ensuring robust information retention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification and identification performance across various attack scenarios, with highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior image fidelity (evidenced by FID and CLIP scores).

Conclusion: SFW is an effective framework for balancing robustness and image fidelity, addressing inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking for latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

*Guoyi Zhang,Siyang Chen,Guangsheng Xu,Zhihua Shen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework called TenRPCANet that uses tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition for small moving target detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance on infrared and space object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small moving target detection is crucial for defense applications but challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual cues, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing approaches lack robustness in complex environments.

Method: Reformulates detection as tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition. Uses tokenization strategy with self-attention to enforce multi-order tensor low-rank priors, and feature refinement module inspired by tensor RPCA to enhance target saliency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-frame infrared small target detection and space object detection tasks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates both effectiveness and generalizability, requiring minimal assumptions about target characteristics while handling complex environments robustly.

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDFFDNet is a novel deep image registration method that uses exponential-decay free-form deformation and adaptive sparse motion aggregation to handle scenes with depth disparities more efficiently and accurately than previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous deep image registration methods struggle with real scenes containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations in single homography, multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline approaches.

Method: Proposes EDFFDNet with exponential-decay basis function for free-form deformation, Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA) to replace MLP aggregators, and progressive correlation refinement strategy for coarse-to-fine motion estimation.

Result: Reduces parameters by 70.5%, memory by 32.6%, and total runtime by 33.7% while achieving 0.5 dB PSNR gain over state-of-the-art. EDFFDNet-2 further improves PSNR by 1.06 dB with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets and outperforms previous deep learning approaches in efficiency, accuracy, and handling of depth disparity scenes.

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual-TableQA is a large-scale multimodal dataset for visual reasoning over rendered table images, featuring 2.5k tables and 6k QA pairs generated through collaborative LLM pipeline at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for visual table reasoning are limited in scale, diversity, and reasoning depth, especially for rendered table images, creating a gap in evaluating vision-language models.

Method: Modular, scalable autonomous generation pipeline using multiple LLMs collaborating across generation, validation, and inspiration roles with cross-model prompting and LLM-jury filtering.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks and outperform several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature.

Conclusion: The dataset successfully addresses the gap in visual table reasoning benchmarks and demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively enhance model performance on complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

*Himanshu Singh,A. V. Subramanyam,Shivank Rajput,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel adversarial training framework that reduces inter-class feature overlap by projecting out inter-class dependencies, improving both robustness and clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adversarial training fails to address inter-class feature overlap, which is a significant contributor to adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks.

Method: Identifies nearest inter-class neighbors for adversarial samples and removes projections onto these neighbors to enforce feature separability. Uses logits correction to reduce Lipschitz constant and Rademacher complexity.

Result: Strong competitive performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in both robust and clean accuracy compared to leading adversarial training techniques.

Conclusion: Explicitly addressing inter-class feature proximity is crucial for enhancing adversarial robustness in deep neural networks, and the proposed projection-based approach effectively achieves this goal.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mini-o3 is a system that enables deep multi-turn reasoning for visual search tasks by scaling up tool-based interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance through diverse reasoning patterns and an over-turn masking strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source multimodal models exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and limited interaction turns, making them inadequate for difficult visual tasks requiring trial-and-error exploration.

Method: Three key components: 1) Visual Probe Dataset with challenging visual search problems, 2) Iterative data collection pipeline for diverse reasoning patterns, 3) Over-turn masking strategy to prevent penalization of long reasoning chains during reinforcement learning.

Result: The model generates trajectories scaling to tens of turns at inference time with improving accuracy, producing rich reasoning patterns and effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Conclusion: Mini-o3 demonstrates that scaling tool-based interactions enables deep multi-turn reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex visual search tasks through diverse exploration strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A language model agent with video modules as tools that dynamically determines reasoning steps, combined with a critic to evaluate success, achieves strong performance on complex video reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video perception models perform well on short clips but struggle with complex reasoning on longer videos. The paper aims to leverage existing perception capabilities for more complex video reasoning tasks.

Method: Developed a large language model agent that uses video modules as subagents/tools, dynamically determining subsequent steps based on previous results. Introduced a critic to distinguish successful from unsuccessful reasoning sequences.

Result: The combination of agent and critic achieves strong performance on LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL datasets for complex video reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic reasoning with video modules as tools, guided by a critic, effectively leverages existing perception capabilities for complex video reasoning, addressing performance gaps on longer and more complex video queries.

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

### [95] [SEEC: Segmentation-Assisted Multi-Entropy Models for Learned Lossless Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07704)
*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC proposes a segmentation-assisted multi-entropy model framework for lossless image compression that uses semantic segmentation to guide multiple specialized entropy models for different image regions, achieving state-of-the-art compression ratios with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learned image compression methods use a single entropy model for the entire image, which fails to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different semantic regions, limiting compression performance.

Method: The framework extracts image features, applies semantic segmentation to identify different regions, assigns specialized entropy models to each region, and uses multi-channel discrete logistic mixture likelihood to model pixel value distributions effectively.

Result: Experimental results show SEEC achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios on benchmark datasets with minimal encoding/decoding latency, and supports Regions of Interest coding based on segmentation masks.

Conclusion: SEEC demonstrates that using multiple entropy models guided by semantic segmentation significantly improves lossless image compression performance while maintaining efficiency, offering a promising approach for region-adaptive compression.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning approach combining 3D CTA imaging and clinical data to predict stroke recurrence risk and relapse-free survival time, achieving AUC of 0.71 for relapse prediction and identifying heart diseases and carotid arteries as key predictive factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke has high mortality rates (5.5M annually) with 5-25% recurrence in first year and 40% mortality for relapses. Early detection of at-risk patients is crucial for appropriate therapy planning to reduce recurrence rates.

Method: Collected 3D intracranial CTA image data, heart diseases, age, and gender from stroke patients (2010-2024). Trained single- and multimodal deep learning networks for binary relapse detection (Task 1) and relapse-free survival time prediction with classification (Task 2). Used multimodal XSRD-net with vision:tabular modality ratio 0.68:0.32.

Result: Tabular data achieved AUC 0.84 for binary relapse detection. Multimodal model achieved c-index 0.68 for relapse prediction and AUC 0.71 for test dataset. Identified heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) as key predictive factors for relapse detection and RFS prediction.

Conclusion: Multimodal approach combining imaging and clinical data effectively predicts stroke recurrence risk. Heart diseases and carotid artery conditions are central predictive factors. Ongoing data collection and model retraining will strengthen these findings for improved stroke recurrence prediction.

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

*Yimin Pan,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for strand-level hair reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting that handles various hairstyles efficiently within one hour, with a new topological evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human hair reconstruction is challenging but important for VR and digital human modeling. Existing methods focus on geometric quality but neglect strand connectivity and topology.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) Reconstruct detailed hair geometry using differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, 2) Merge Gaussian segments into coherent strands with novel merging scheme, 3) Refine and grow strands under photometric supervision.

Result: Robust handling of diverse hairstyles, efficient reconstruction (typically <1 hour), and demonstrated effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully extends 3DGS for strand-level hair reconstruction and introduces a topological evaluation metric, providing an efficient solution for high-quality hair modeling applications.

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayGaussX accelerates RayGauss for real-time novel-view synthesis by introducing volumetric rendering acceleration techniques, improved ray coherence, scale regularization, and better densification, achieving 5-12x faster training and 50-80x higher FPS while improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but its computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes, necessitating acceleration methods.

Method: Builds on RayGauss with volumetric rendering acceleration (empty-space skipping, adaptive sampling), enhanced ray coherence, scale regularization to reduce false intersections, and improved densification criterion for better density distribution.

Result: Achieves 5x to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Conclusion: RayGaussX successfully accelerates RayGauss for real-time performance while maintaining and even improving visual quality, making it suitable for real-world scene rendering applications.

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to

*Maja Schlereth,Moritz Schillinger,Katharina Breininger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised neural network for fusing two orthogonal anisotropic low-resolution MR images to reconstruct high-resolution anatomical details without requiring high-resolution training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing MR image quality with acquisition time and patient comfort is challenging. Analyzing individual low-resolution scans is time-consuming and can lead to inaccurate interpretation.

Method: Multi-view neural network trained in self-supervised manner with sparse coordinate-based loss, enabling integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. Combines patient-agnostic offline and patient-specific online phases.

Result: Achieves comparable or improved super-resolution performance compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for different upsampling scales. Achieves 10x speed-up for patient-specific reconstruction with similar or better quality.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively reconstructs high-resolution MR images from orthogonal anisotropic low-resolution scans without HR training data, offering significant time savings while maintaining or improving image quality.

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

*Mahtab Dahaghin,Milind G. Padalkar,Matteo Toso,Alessio Del Bue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatFill introduces a depth-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting inpainting method that achieves state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency, combining depth-based supervision and consistency-aware refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with inpainting missing regions, often producing blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent geometry in occluded or edited areas.

Method: Uses joint depth-based and object-based supervision for accurate Gaussian placement, plus a consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively corrects inconsistent regions without disrupting the scene.

Result: Surpasses existing NeRF-based and 3DGS-based methods in visual fidelity, reduces training time by 24.5%, and delivers sharper details with fewer artifacts across challenging viewpoints.

Conclusion: SplatFill provides an effective solution for high-quality 3D scene inpainting with improved perceptual quality and efficiency compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

*Zhuoxu Huang,Mingqi Gao,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLM bridges the representation gap between LLMs and 3D point clouds using Object-centric Discriminative Representation and Geometric Reactivation Decoder, achieving significant performance improvements on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address representation misalignment between LLMs (semantic tokens) and 3D point clouds (dense geometry), which limits both input processing and output accuracy in prior methods.

Method: Introduces Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR) for object-centric tokens with hard negative-aware training, and Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD) to combine LLM-inferred geometry with dense features.

Result: +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks.

Conclusion: PLM effectively bridges the representation gap, enhances resilience to distractors, and enables comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding without large-scale pre-alignment.

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

*Tiancheng Yang,Lin Zhang,Jiaye Lin,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-LEAF method dynamically detects and corrects hallucinations in MLLMs using layer-wise attention analysis, achieving 53% improvement in captioning and 4% boost in VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations where generated text conflicts with visual input, and existing uniform attention adjustment methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers and heads.

Method: Introduces Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) to flag anomalous layers and Image Attention Focus (IAF) to score attention heads. Uses these diagnostics to guide Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF) for dynamic error correction during inference.

Result: 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, approximately 4% improvement in both accuracy and F1-score on VQA tasks, with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-guided diagnostics effectively pinpoint hallucination sources, and D-LEAF substantially suppresses hallucinations while preserving model efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Result: Achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting training data usage across various neural network architectures (MobileNet to Vision Transformers) on 5 public benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: Active MINT successfully incorporates auditability as an optimization objective during training and provides an effective method for membership inference, contributing to AI transparency and security.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

### [105] [Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07917)
*Chunlin Wen,Yu Zhang,Jie Fan,Hongyuan Zhu,Xiu-Shen Wei,Yijun Wang,Zhiqiang Kou,Shuzhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCNet introduces object-level correlation for few-shot semantic segmentation, addressing background noise by matching support targets with query general objects rather than entire images, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSS methods build image-level correlations that contain hard pixel noise from irrelevant background objects, leading to background overfitting. Biological vision processes identify novel objects through object-level information, which is more effective in low-data regimes.

Method: Proposes Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) with two modules: General Object Mining Module (GOMM) constructs query general object features using saliency and high-level similarity cues; Correlation Construction Module (CCM) establishes object-level correlation by matching target prototypes with general object features.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing effective mining of query target features and suppression of hard pixel noise.

Conclusion: Object-level correlation is more effective than image-level correlation for few-shot semantic segmentation, successfully addressing background noise issues and improving segmentation accuracy for novel categories.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: ScoreHOI is a diffusion-based optimizer that uses diffusion priors and physical constraints to achieve precise human-object interaction reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous optimization methods struggle with physically plausible reconstruction results due to lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions.

Method: Uses diffusion-based optimizer with score-guided sampling to reconstruct conditional distribution of human and object pose, guided by physical constraints and contact-driven iterative refinement.

Result: Extensive evaluations show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise and robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: ScoreHOI effectively introduces diffusion priors for accurate recovery of human-object interactions, demonstrating significant advancements in this challenging task.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToothMCL introduces the first multimodal pretraining framework for tooth segmentation using CBCT and IOS data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 12% improvement for CBCT and 8% for IOS segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tooth segmentation methods lack rigorous validation, demonstrate limited performance, and have poor clinical applicability despite growing interest in digital dentistry technologies.

Method: ToothMCL (Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning) integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS) modalities through multimodal contrastive learning to capture modality-invariant representations and model fine-grained anatomical features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 12% improvement for CBCT segmentation and 8% for IOS segmentation in Dice Similarity Coefficient. Demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging conditions and clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables precise multi-class segmentation and accurate FDI tooth numbering identification, representing a significant advancement in digital dentistry with strong clinical applicability.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical gap between benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on consumer-grade hardware, where performance is dominated by system-level bottlenecks rather than compute limitations.

Method: Introduces a Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm that uses a fast low-resolution pass and only escalates to high-resolution when detection confidence is low. Compares architectural early-exit and resolution-adaptive routing strategies.

Result: On a 5000-image COCO dataset, the method achieves 1.85x speedup over PyTorch Early-Exit baseline with only 5.51% mAP loss.

Conclusion: Provides a practical blueprint for deploying real-time AI on consumer devices by shifting focus from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that maximize throughput.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

TL;DR: A decoder that generates images matching user-specified DNN features using guided diffusion, enabling analysis of black-box feature spaces without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of DNN feature extraction by creating a method that can generate images with guaranteed feature matching, allowing better understanding of what attributes are encoded in specific features.

Method: Implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides reverse image generation to minimize Euclidean distance between estimated clean image features and user-specified target features at each step.

Result: The decoder successfully generates images with features remarkably similar to user-specified ones across CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50, and vision transformer, providing valuable insights into their feature spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed decoder effectively analyzes DNN feature spaces without additional training, runs on consumer GPUs, and reveals which image attributes are encoded into specific features through guaranteed feature matching.

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of 6D pose estimation for arbitrary unseen objects where 3D models are unavailable, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain gaps exist between synthetic and real images.

Method: A pipeline with two key components: 1) coarse-to-fine alignment module that jointly refines scale and pose using multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare refinement, 2) text-guided generative domain randomization strategy to diversify textures for effective fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), far surpassing prior approaches, and demonstrates robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand.

Conclusion: The method enables high-fidelity single-view 3D generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation, validating practicality for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

Motivation: Current MLLMs underperform on vision-centric tasks like object counting and spatial reasoning due to text-only supervision that provides indirect visual guidance and causes loss of fine-grained visual details during training.

Method: VIRAL (Visual Representation Alignment) - a regularization strategy that explicitly aligns MLLMs' internal visual representations with those of pre-trained vision foundation models, enabling retention of critical visual details and complementing additional visual knowledge.

Result: Consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating key design choices.

Conclusion: VIRAL opens up an important direction for effective visual information integration in MLLM training, demonstrating that explicit visual representation alignment significantly enhances performance on vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR is a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that uses graph spectral processing to embed logical rules as spectral templates, achieving superior accuracy, speed, and interpretability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning's interpretability and neural networks' scalability by leveraging graph signal processing in the spectral domain, creating a unified framework that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Embeds logical rules as spectral templates using graph signal processing and Laplacian eigenstructure of knowledge graphs. Includes extensions like dynamic graph learning, rational/diffusion filters, mixture-of-spectral-experts, proof-guided training, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy on reasoning benchmarks (ProofWriter, CLUTRR), faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, and higher interpretability compared to transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic programming systems.

Conclusion: Spectral NSR establishes a scalable and principled foundation for next-generation reasoning systems, offering transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches through spectral domain inference.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Agent is a GUI agent that uses expert demonstrations to solve complex UI tasks by extracting step-by-step instructions and executing them precisely, achieving 60% success on previously unsolvable OSWorld tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions, and personalized trajectories, creating a need for more reliable automation.

Method: Leverages single expert demonstration to extract step-by-step instructions, executes strictly following user-intended trajectory, and uses verifier and backtracker modules for robustness against unexpected interruptions.

Result: Achieves 60% success rate on OSWorld tasks that all top-ranked agents previously failed to complete.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and extensible framework that bridges the gap between current GUI agents and reliable real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

TL;DR: Analysis of neurosymbolic frameworks focusing on DeepProbLog, Scallop, and DomiKnowS, highlighting their technical facets, challenges, and expressivity in problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic frameworks combine neural and symbolic AI but face challenges with learning curves, lack of user-friendly tools, and unifying frameworks. The paper aims to characterize existing frameworks and spark community action.

Method: Characterizes technical facets of NeSy frameworks including symbolic representation language, neural integration, and algorithms. Analyzes three frameworks (DeepProbLog, Scallop, DomiKnowS) to identify challenges and expressivity.

Result: Identifies key aspects and challenges in neurosymbolic modeling, providing foundation for understanding framework expressivity across different problem types.

Conclusion: The analysis lays groundwork for transformative action in neurosymbolic AI development, encouraging the community to rethink problem specification and framework design approaches.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

TL;DR: FETCH classifier uses hybrid LLM/ML ensemble and automatic follow-up questions to achieve 97.37% accuracy in legal issue classification, outperforming GPT-5 at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions seek legal help annually, and misclassifying legal problems can lead to severe consequences like missed deadlines, physical abuse, housing loss, or child custody issues while waiting for proper assistance.

Method: Hybrid LLM/ML ensemble classification method with automatic generation of follow-up questions to enrich initial problem narratives, tested on 419 real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service.

Result: Achieved classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37% using inexpensive models, exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art GPT-5 model.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise in significantly reducing costs while maintaining high accuracy for guiding legal system users to appropriate resources.

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

TL;DR: Language Self-Play (LSP) enables LLMs to improve performance through self-play reinforcement learning without needing additional training data, outperforming data-driven baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental bottleneck of LLMs requiring ever more training data by developing a method that allows models to improve without additional data.

Method: Game-theoretic self-play framework where models compete against themselves in a competitive game setting, using reinforcement learning to develop stronger policies.

Result: Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct show improved performance on instruction-following benchmarks through self-play alone, more effectively than data-driven approaches.

Conclusion: Self-play reinforcement learning provides a viable alternative to data scaling for improving LLM capabilities, demonstrating that models can enhance their performance without additional training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Method: Combines Gemma 2B large language model with a classifier-LLM architecture incorporating a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Uses transfer learning approach with pre-trained language models.

Result: Achieves 10% overall performance improvement compared to current methodologies. Significantly reduces data and compute power requirements while maintaining performance close to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The architecture demonstrates effective transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining robust under data limitations. This integration of LLMs with EEG decoding pushes boundaries for brain-computer interfaces and improves accessibility for assistive communication technologies.

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with
the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography
(EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a
lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production
more accessible and efficient.

*Xiaomeng Hu,Fei Huang,Chenhan Yuan,Junyang Lin,Tsung-Yi Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARE is a novel decoding-time safety alignment framework that combines real-time safety monitoring, rollback mechanism, and introspection-based intervention to achieve superior safety-quality trade-off in LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding-time interventions force severe trade-offs between safety and response quality in large language models, creating a need for better safety alignment during decoding.

Method: Three key components: (1) guard model for real-time safety monitoring, (2) rollback mechanism with token buffer for early correction, (3) introspection-based intervention where the model generates self-reflective critiques to guide subsequent decoding.

Result: Experimental results show superior balance of safety, quality, and efficiency with low harmful response rate and minimal disruption to user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Conclusion: CARE framework effectively addresses the safety-quality trade-off in LLM decoding through integrated real-time monitoring, rollback correction, and self-reflective intervention strategies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EICS - a single-pass metric combining sheaf inconsistency and causal emergence to quantify when transformer circuits behave coherently and trustworthily.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of formal methods to quantify when active transformer circuits in LLMs are behaving coherently and thus trustworthy, despite mechanistic interpretability identifying functional subgraphs.

Method: Specializes sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to transformer circuits, combining normalized sheaf inconsistency from local Jacobians/activations with Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence.

Result: Introduces Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS) - white-box, single-pass, dimensionless metric with practical guidance on interpretation and computation.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical framework for quantifying circuit coherence, with empirical validation on LLM tasks deferred to future work.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

TL;DR: ALICE is a Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art cryptogram decryption with minimal training data and provides interpretable insights into how neural networks solve combinatorial problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study neural network generalization in combinatorially complex domains using cryptogram solving as a testbed, where models must choose from 26! possible substitution mappings without explicit cipher access.

Method: Developed ALICE - an encoder-only Transformer with a novel bijective decoding head using Gumbel-Sinkhorn method to explicitly model permutations, enabling direct extraction of learned cipher mappings.

Result: ALICE sets new state-of-the-art for accuracy and speed, generalizing to unseen ciphers after training on only ~1500 unique ciphers (3.7×10^{-24} of possible cipher space). Early exit analysis shows progressive refinement mirroring human strategies.

Conclusion: The architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure, offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High training costs make brute-force trial-and-error approaches infeasible for improving LLMs, and inverse problems have proven successful in uncovering fundamental scientific laws in other domains.

Method: Applying inverse problem methodologies to uncover scaling laws that guide LLM development, inspired by successful applications in scientific domains.

Result: Proposes that inverse problems can efficiently reveal scaling principles for building LLMs with desirable performance at significantly lower costs.

Conclusion: Inverse problems offer a promising alternative approach to discover scaling laws for LLM development, enabling more cost-effective model improvements compared to traditional trial-and-error methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

TL;DR: This study compares CNNs and vision transformers for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI analysis to validate model alignment with thermal physics principles. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (94% binary, 73% multiclass), with models learning physically meaningful features, though performance varied significantly across fault types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI deployment for PV monitoring faces interpretability barriers, as deep learning models lack validation that their decisions align with thermal physics principles, creating hesitancy in critical energy infrastructure applications.

Method: Systematic comparison of CNN models (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection using XRAI saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles on 20,000 infrared images across normal operation and 11 fault categories.

Result: Swin Transformer achieved highest performance (94% binary accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy). XRAI analysis revealed models learn physically meaningful features consistent with thermal signatures. Performance varied significantly: electrical faults achieved strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like soiling remained challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33).

Conclusion: The thermal physics-guided interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment barriers in renewable energy infrastructure by ensuring model decisions align with physical principles.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient conflict resolution methods (PCGrad, CAGrad, GradNorm) are computationally demanding and limit application in large models and transformers.

Method: Combines PCGrad principles with gradient accumulation and adaptive arbitration mechanism. Evaluated on self-supervised learning tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on ImageNet 1K and head/neck CT datasets.

Result: Stochastic mode achieved 2x computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality. Superior performance across all metrics with lower L1 and SSIM losses. High scalability from compact to large architectures and compatibility with modern optimizers.

Conclusion: GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to gradient conflicts in multi-task learning, making it applicable to modern large models.

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Conclusion: Combining deep learning (EfficientNet) with digital twin technology enables an active, personalized approach to cardiac disease prediction, offering potential for improved early detection and treatment planning.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning MRI reconstruction enables 4x acceleration with preserved diagnostic quality, reducing scan time by 75% while maintaining image quality comparable to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for faster MRI scans while maintaining diagnostic quality, as traditional MRI acquisition times are lengthy and limit clinical throughput.

Method: Used DeepFoqus-Accelerate algorithm to reconstruct phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences from both public datasets and prospective clinical data (18 healthy volunteers). Compared AI reconstructions with standard-of-care using both qualitative (5-point Likert scale by neuroradiologists and technologists) and quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, HaarPSI).

Result: No AI-reconstructed scan scored below minimally acceptable (score 3), with 95% scoring ≥4. Quantitative metrics showed excellent performance: mean SSIM 0.95±0.03, PSNR >41.0 dB, HaarPSI >0.94. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. Inter-rater agreement was slight to moderate.

Conclusion: DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time while preserving diagnostic image quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

Abstract: This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based
MRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans
accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.
The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January
2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse
pathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were
reconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care
(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists
independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets
using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for
408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity
Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally
acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases
>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to
moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These
findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain
MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image
quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

### [128] [Enhanced SegNet with Integrated Grad-CAM for Interpretable Retinal Layer Segmentation in OCT Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07795)
*S M Asiful Islam Saky,Ugyen Tshering*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for automated retinal layer segmentation in OCT images with architectural innovations, hybrid loss function, and Grad-CAM for interpretability, achieving high accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual retinal layer segmentation in OCT is time-consuming and variable, while conventional deep learning models lack interpretability, creating a need for automated and clinically trustworthy solutions.

Method: SegNet-based framework with modified pooling strategies, hybrid loss function (categorical cross-entropy + Dice loss), and integrated Grad-CAM for visual explanations, trained on Duke OCT dataset.

Result: Achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, Dice coefficient of 0.9446, Jaccard Index of 0.8951, with robust performance across most retinal layers and anatomically relevant Grad-CAM visualizations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges accuracy and interpretability, offering strong potential for standardizing OCT analysis and fostering clinical trust in AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

### [129] [Kernel VICReg for Self-Supervised Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07289)
*M. Hadi Sepanj,Benyamin Ghojogh,Paul Fieguth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Kernel VICReg extends VICReg SSL to RKHS using kernel methods, enabling nonlinear feature learning without explicit mappings and showing improved performance on complex/small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SSL methods operate in Euclidean space, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric structures. The authors aim to bridge classical kernel methods with modern representation learning.

Method: Lifts the VICReg objective (variance, invariance, covariance) into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space by kernelizing each term of the loss, operating on double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms.

Result: Consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet100, with strong improvements on datasets with prominent nonlinear structures. UMAP visualizations show better isometry and class separation.

Conclusion: Kernelizing SSL objectives is a promising direction that avoids representational collapse and improves performance, particularly for complex or small-scale data with nonlinear structures.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

### [130] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) improves retrieval by directly retrieving documents based on reranker preferences using greedy search on proximity graphs, achieving significant performance gains within limited computational budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional retrieve-and-rerank pipelines are limited by initial retrieval quality and the computational constraints of LLM-based rerankers, which restrict the number of documents that can be processed effectively.

Method: Uses greedy search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor algorithms to strategically prioritize promising documents for reranking based on document similarity, bypassing traditional sequential reranking.

Result: Substantial performance improvements: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9 on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100 documents.

Conclusion: Strategic document selection for reranking can significantly improve retrieval accuracy under limited computational budgets when using fixed embedding and reranker models.

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

### [131] [Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07253)
*Julian Killingback,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for complex retrieval tasks and introduces a diverse evaluation set to assess retrieval models' capabilities on multi-faceted natural language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval models need to handle complex queries with multiple constraints and requirements, but existing evaluation sets focus mainly on simple queries, creating a gap in assessing real-world complex retrieval capabilities.

Method: The authors construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark state-of-the-art retrieval models, while also exploring LLM-based query expansion and rewriting techniques.

Result: Even the best models struggle significantly, achieving only 0.346 nDCG@10 and 0.587 R@100 across all tasks. LLM augmentation helps weaker models but decreases performance for the strongest model.

Conclusion: Current retrieval models are inadequate for complex real-world retrieval tasks, and LLM-based query rewriting doesn't consistently improve performance, highlighting the need for better retrieval model development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

*Kapil Madan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: ArGen is a framework for aligning LLMs with complex, configurable rules through automated reward scoring, GRPO, and OPA-inspired governance, achieving 70.9% improvement in domain adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond preference-based alignment and ensure LLMs adhere to multifaceted policies including ethical principles, safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards.

Method: Uses principle-based automated reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer.

Result: Achieved 70.9% improvement in domain-scope adherence over baseline, demonstrated through a medical AI assistant guided by Dharmic ethics principles.

Conclusion: ArGen provides a path to technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant AI systems for safe global deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in
domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository,
we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that
are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe
deployment in diverse global contexts.

*Sven Kirchner,Nils Purschke,Ross Greer,Alois C. Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DepthVision framework uses LiDAR point clouds to generate synthetic RGB images via conditional GAN, then blends them with real RGB using luminance-aware adaptation to improve robot vision in degraded conditions without fine-tuning VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded (darkness, motion blur) by creating a multimodal approach that compensates for sensor limitations.

Method: Synthesizes RGB images from sparse LiDAR using conditional GAN with refiner network, then combines with real RGB using Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation (LAMA) that dynamically blends data based on lighting conditions.

Result: Improves performance in low-light conditions with substantial gains over RGB-only baselines while maintaining compatibility with frozen vision-language models, validated on real and simulated datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot operation in real-world environments with degraded visual conditions.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

### [134] [Can SSD-Mamba2 Unlock Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Motion Control?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07593)
*Gavin Tao,Yinuo Wang,Jinzhao Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SSD-Mamba2-based vision-driven RL framework for motion control that achieves superior performance with near-linear scaling, lower latency, and better memory efficiency compared to Transformer-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL controllers for motion control are either blind (proprioception-only) or use fusion backbones with poor compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, while Transformers have quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.

Method: Uses SSD-Mamba2 selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality for both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. Policies are trained end-to-end with curricula randomizing terrain/appearance and increasing scene complexity, using state-centric rewards.

Result: Consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions/falls), and sample efficiency. Converges faster at same compute budget with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention.

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion control, enabling longer look-ahead and higher token resolution with stable training under limited compute.

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

*Leonardo Zini,Elia Frigieri,Sebastiano Aloscari,Marcello Generali,Lorenzo Dodi,Robert Dosen,Lorenzo Baraldi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SVGauge is a new human-aligned metric for evaluating text-to-SVG generation that combines visual fidelity and semantic consistency, outperforming existing metrics like FID and CLIPScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image evaluation metrics fail to properly assess SVG images due to their symbolic and vectorial nature, creating a need for SVG-specific evaluation criteria.

Method: SVGauge jointly measures visual fidelity using SigLIP image embeddings refined with PCA and whitening, and semantic consistency by comparing BLIP-2-generated captions against original prompts using SBERT and TF-IDF.

Result: SVGauge achieves the highest correlation with human judgments and faithfully reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators on the SHE benchmark.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the necessity of vector-specific evaluation and provides SVGauge as a practical tool for benchmarking future text-to-SVG generation models.

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

*Jierui Ren,Haojie Jin,Bo Pang,Yisong Chen,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Neural cone radiosity method improves high-frequency glossy reflections using reflectance-aware ray cone encoding with multi-resolution hash grids


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural radiosity methods struggle with high-frequency, view-dependent radiance distributions from glossy materials due to limitations in positional feature encoding

Method: Proposes reflectance-aware ray cone encoding using pre-filtered multi-resolution hash grid to approximate glossy BSDF lobe and embed view-dependent reflectance characteristics through spatial aggregation

Result: Produces high-quality, noise-free real-time renderings across various glossiness levels with superior fidelity and realism compared to baselines

Conclusion: The method significantly improves modeling of high-frequency reflection distributions while maintaining compact and efficient architecture

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

TL;DR: Astra is the first LLM-based multi-agent system that optimizes existing CUDA kernels from SGLang framework, achieving 1.32x average speedup through collaborative agent workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU kernel optimization is crucial for LLM training/serving but requires extensive manual tuning. Existing compiler systems still demand substantial engineering effort, and prior LLM approaches only translate PyTorch to CUDA rather than optimizing existing implementations.

Method: Multi-agent LLM system where specialized agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning. Starts from existing CUDA implementations from SGLang framework rather than PyTorch modules.

Result: Achieves average 1.32x speedup using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. Successfully applies loop transformations, optimizes memory access patterns, exploits CUDA intrinsics, and leverages fast math operations.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM systems represent a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization, demonstrating autonomous optimization capabilities that yield substantial performance gains.

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

TL;DR: IoT-based smart fridge system using ESP32-CAM and computer vision for food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature monitoring to reduce waste and optimize consumption, with improved calibration for better detection reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in food management through IoT and computer vision, particularly overcoming issues with overlapping items, occluded views, and poor detection reliability in high-density inventory conditions to reduce waste and improve household consumption.

Method: Three-module system: data pre-processing, object detection/management, and web-based visualization. Uses variant of focal loss with adaptive class-wise error calibration via temperature scaling to mitigate over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification.

Result: Robust functional calibration significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions and scalability challenges, demonstrating practical improvements in food management efficiency.

Conclusion: The system provides a user-focused approach to modern food management that advances sustainable living goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption, with reliable detection performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

TL;DR: Falcon3-Audio is a family of audio-language models that achieves state-of-the-art performance on audio benchmarks using remarkably small data (under 30K hours) and simple architecture, outperforming larger models trained on much more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs transforming NLP, audio integration remains underexplored despite audio's importance in human communication. The authors aim to develop efficient audio-language models that don't require massive datasets or complex architectures.

Method: Built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders using less than 30K hours of public audio data. Uses single-stage training without curriculum learning, multiple encoders, or complex cross-attention connectors.

Result: Falcon3-Audio-7B matches best open-weight models on MMAU benchmark (score 64.14, matching R1-AQA) with superior data/parameter efficiency. The 1B model remains competitive with larger 2B-13B models. Outperforms models trained on 500K+ hours of data.

Conclusion: Common complexities in audio-language models are unnecessary for strong performance. Simple architectures with small datasets can achieve state-of-the-art results, demonstrating superior efficiency and transparency in audio-language modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models

Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of generative AI for creating realistic deepfakes poses serious threats to voice biometric applications, and existing detection methods are vulnerable to anti-forensic attacks that conceal generative signatures.

Method: Extensive evaluation of SoTA audio deepfake detection methods on five benchmark datasets, comparing raw and spectrogram-based approaches under various anti-forensic attacks including statistical modifications and optimization-based adversarial attacks.

Result: Analysis reveals vulnerabilities of current ADD methods against diverse anti-forensic techniques, highlighting their limitations in adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for designing more robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics and guides future research in developing adaptive defense strategies against evolving anti-forensic techniques.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs outperform other spectral/rhythm features for environmental audio classification using deep CNNs on ESC-50 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and compare the performance of various spectral and rhythm features (mel-spectrograms, MFCCs, tempograms, chromagrams, etc.) for audio classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks.

Method: Used a deep CNN with end-to-end deep learning pipeline on ESC-50 dataset (2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings). Evaluated multiple spectral and rhythm features as input data and measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for multiclass classification.

Result: Mel-scaled spectrograms and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) performed significantly better than other spectral and rhythm features (cyclic tempograms, STFT chromagrams, CQT chromagrams, CENS chromagrams) for audio classification.

Conclusion: For audio classification tasks using deep CNNs, mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs are the most effective input features among the spectral and rhythm features evaluated in this research.

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning is used to create meaningful representations of ice crystal shapes from imagery, enabling better quantification of crystal diversity and improved climate modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ice-containing clouds significantly impact climate but are difficult to model due to the diverse shapes (habits) of ice crystals, requiring better characterization methods.

Method: Using self-supervised learning (SSL) with a vision transformer pre-trained on numerous cloud particle images to learn robust latent representations of crystal morphology.

Result: The SSL approach successfully learned meaningful representations of ice crystal morphology and enabled quantification of ice crystal diversity through these latent representations.

Conclusion: SSL-driven representations provide a powerful tool for improving ice crystal characterization and better constraining their role in Earth's climate system.

Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due
to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning
(SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By
pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn
robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various
science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL
approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a
relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent
representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven
representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and
subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.
