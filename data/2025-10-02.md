### [1] [Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125)
*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DTO is a novel self-contained machine unlearning approach for LLMs that directly optimizes token-level objectives without requiring external resources, achieving superior forget quality while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for LLMs depend on auxiliary models, datasets, or commercial services, which are impractical and pose privacy risks. A self-contained approach is needed.

Method: Direct token optimization (DTO) identifies target tokens for unlearning and non-target tokens for utility preservation, then directly optimizes token-level objectives without external resources.

Result: DTO achieves up to 16.8× improvement in forget quality on benchmark datasets compared to latest baselines while maintaining comparable model utility.

Conclusion: DTO provides an effective and practical self-contained solution for machine unlearning in LLMs, eliminating dependency on external resources while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

### [2] [TAMA: Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent for Procedural Activity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00161)
*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAMA is a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent framework for procedural activity understanding that uses multimedia-returning tools for interleaved multimodal reasoning without training, improving vision-language model performance on procedural QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural activity assistants have broad applications from daily life to professional settings, but system development for such assistants remains underexplored, creating a need for effective frameworks.

Method: Proposed TAMA framework with multimedia-returning tools for interleaved multimodal reasoning in a training-free setting, featuring agentic flexible tool selection.

Result: Experimental results on ProMQA-Assembly dataset show improved performance for vision-language models (GPT-5 and MiMo-VL), with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of multimedia-returning tools and flexible tool selection.

Conclusion: The TAMA framework facilitates the 'thinking with images' paradigm for video and multimodal tasks and supports development of procedural activity assistants.

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

### [3] [DRBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Enterprise Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00172)
*Amirhossein Abaskohi,Tianyi Chen,Miguel Muñoz-Mármol,Curtis Fox,Amrutha Varshini Ramesh,Étienne Marcotte,Xing Han Lù,Nicolas Chapados,Spandana Gella,Christopher Pal,Alexandre Drouin,Issam H. Laradji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex, multi-step deep research tasks in enterprise settings, requiring information retrieval from both public web and private company knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on simple questions or web-only queries, but enterprise settings require complex, multi-step research that combines public and private knowledge across heterogeneous sources.

Method: Created 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains using a synthesis pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, evaluating agents on recall, factual accuracy, and report coherence across diverse data sources.

Result: Evaluated diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source models (GPT, Llama, Qwen) and strategies, revealing their strengths, weaknesses, and advancement paths for enterprise deep research.

Conclusion: DRBench provides an effective framework for benchmarking AI agents on complex enterprise research tasks, highlighting critical areas for improvement in enterprise deep research capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

### [4] [PrimeX: A Dataset of Worldview, Opinion, and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00174)
*Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Brihi Joshi,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrimeX dataset combines opinion survey data with belief explanations and worldview assessments to improve language model personalization through better understanding of individual belief systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models become more widely adopted, there's a need to better represent individual users and their belief systems to improve model alignment and personalization.

Method: Developed PrimeX dataset containing public opinion survey data from 858 US residents, including written explanations for opinions and Primal World Belief survey assessments of worldview.

Result: The additional belief information (explanations and worldview) in PrimeX shows value for personalizing language models and provides benefits for both NLP and psychological research.

Conclusion: PrimeX dataset opens up new avenues for studying how belief systems can be utilized to improve language model alignment and personalization.

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

### [5] [Personalized Reasoning: Just-In-Time Personalization and Why LLMs Fail At It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00177)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Avinandan Bose,Faeze Brahman,Simon Shaolei Du,Pang Wei Koh,Maryam Fazel,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO is an evaluation framework that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using personas with sparse preferences, revealing that current LLMs struggle with personalized reasoning and often produce worse alignment than generic responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development treats task-solving and preference alignment as separate challenges, failing in human-facing applications where correct problem-solving is insufficient if responses mismatch user needs, especially in cold-start scenarios without prior interaction history.

Method: PREFDISCO transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences, creating scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains depending on user context while maintaining factual accuracy.

Result: Evaluation of 21 frontier models across 10 tasks shows 29.0% of naive personalization attempts produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, and generic responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively.

Conclusion: Personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than emerging naturally, and PREFDISCO establishes it as a measurable research frontier while revealing fundamental limitations in current LLMs' interactive capabilities for domains requiring personalization.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

### [6] [BiasFreeBench: a Benchmark for Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00232)
*Xin Xu,Xunzhi He,Churan Zhi,Ruizhe Chen,Julian McAuley,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasFreeBench is a benchmark that standardizes evaluation of bias mitigation methods in LLMs by comparing 8 techniques across 2 test scenarios using unified metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias mitigation studies use inconsistent baselines and metrics, and focus on probability comparisons rather than real-world user interactions where fair responses matter.

Method: Created BiasFreeBench benchmark comparing 8 mainstream bias mitigation techniques (4 prompting-based, 4 training-based) on multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA scenarios, reorganizing datasets into unified query-response format with Bias-Free Score metric.

Result: Systematic comparison of debiasing performance across key dimensions: prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of training strategies to unseen bias types.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a unified testbed for bias mitigation research and will be publicly released to enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods.

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

### [7] [TASER: Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00255)
*Monishwaran Maheswaran,Marco Carini,Christian Federmann,Tony Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASER is a new translation evaluation metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to systematically assess translation quality through step-by-step reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in WMT24 Metrics Shared Task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing automated translation metrics by leveraging the explicit reasoning capabilities of LRMs for more accurate and interpretable translation quality assessment.

Method: Uses structured prompting templates with Large Reasoning Models (specifically OpenAI's o3 model) to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of translation quality in both reference-based and reference-free scenarios.

Result: Achieved highest soft pairwise accuracy in system-level evaluation for both reference-based and reference-free settings, outperforming all existing metrics. Reference-free variant ranked as top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches at segment level.

Conclusion: Large Reasoning Models represent a measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs through explicit reasoning processes.

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261)
*Xiaoyu Song,William Han,Tony Chen,Chaojing Duan,Michael A. Rosenberg,Emerson Liu,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first open-source RAG pipeline for Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs), showing consistent performance improvements over non-RAG baselines across three public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in generative ELMs that can produce textual responses from ECG signals, but no existing open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline design for ELMs exists, despite RAG's proven benefits in reducing hallucinations and improving natural language generation in LLMs.

Method: The authors developed the first open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, conducted baseline experiments and ablation studies for natural language generation, and evaluated their approach on three public datasets.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that ELMs with RAG consistently improve performance over non-RAG baselines and revealed key design considerations for ELM development.

Conclusion: The presented RAG pipeline for ELMs successfully addresses the existing gap in open-source implementations and provides valuable insights for future ELM development, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

### [9] [Judging with Confidence: Calibrating Autoraters to Preference Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00263)
*Zhuohang Li,Xiaowei Li,Chengyu Huang,Guowang Li,Katayoon Goshvadi,Bo Dai,Dale Schuurmans,Paul Zhou,Hamid Palangi,Yiwen Song,Palash Goyal,Murat Kantarcioglu,Bradley A. Malin,Yuan Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for calibrating probabilistic autoraters to model full preference distributions rather than discrete labels, addressing subjectivity and bias in LLM-based automated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autoraters are unreliable because they're trained on discrete preference labels, forcing single ground truths onto subjective, ambiguous tasks that should model full preference distributions.

Method: Two learning methods: 1) supervised fine-tuning for dense probabilistic labels, and 2) reinforcement learning for sparse binary labels, both using distribution-matching objectives.

Result: Fine-tuned autoraters show better alignment with target preference distributions, improved calibration, significantly lower positional bias, while maintaining performance on objective tasks.

Conclusion: Modeling full preference distributions through calibrated probabilistic autoraters improves reliability and reduces bias in automated LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

### [10] [Efficient Layer-wise LLM Fine-tuning for Revision Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00268)
*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IR-Tuning is a layer-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that dynamically selects important LLM layers for text revision classification, achieving superior performance with fast convergence and low resource requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are underexplored for text classification tasks like revision classification, which requires nuanced understanding. Fine-tuning LLMs for such tasks is challenging due to expensive and scarce revision annotations.

Method: Proposed IR-Tuning, a plug-and-play layer-wise PEFT framework that fine-tunes only a subset of important LLM layers selected based on gradient norm distribution, while freezing redundant layers.

Result: IR-Tuning outperforms several layer-wise PEFT baselines across diverse text revisions, achieves fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption, and remains effective on small revision corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed IR-Tuning framework provides an efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs on text revision classification tasks with limited data, demonstrating superior performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

### [11] [SafePassage: High-Fidelity Information Extraction with Black Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00276)
*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafePassage is a three-step pipeline that reduces hallucinations in LLM-based information extraction by generating grounded context passages and verifying their consistency with extracted information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black box LLMs make IE easy to configure but hard to trust, as extracted information may not be grounded in the source document, leading to hallucinations.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) LLM extractor generates entities and contexts, (2) string-based global aligner, (3) scoring model to verify consistency between extracted information and grounded passages.

Result: Reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on IE tasks with minimal false positives. Fine-tuned transformer encoder outperforms LLM scoring model. High agreement with human judgments.

Conclusion: SafePassage enables trustworthy LLM-based IE and can dually serve as an evaluation framework. Task-specific fine-tuning on small datasets (1-2 hours of annotation) yields superior performance.

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

*Ruochen Li,Jun Li,Bailiang Jian,Kun Yuan,Youxiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current radiology report evaluation metrics fail to earn clinicians' trust despite high scores, revealing fundamental flaws in assessing report quality. The paper proposes a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework with criteria for clinical alignment, discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap between automated radiology reports receiving high evaluation scores and clinicians' actual trust in them, indicating flaws in current evaluation metrics that don't properly assess clinical quality.

Method: Developed a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework with defined criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities. Used a fine-grained dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types, clinical significance labels, and explanations to systematically evaluate existing metrics.

Result: Revealed limitations of existing metrics in interpreting clinical semantics: failing to distinguish clinically significant errors, over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error severity levels.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides guidance for building more clinically reliable evaluation methods that better align with clinical practice and earn clinicians' trust.

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

*Ľuboš Kriš,Jaroslav Kopčan,Qiwei Peng,Andrej Ridzik,Marcel Veselý,Martin Tamajka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: o-mega is a hyperparameter optimization tool that automatically identifies the most effective explainable AI methods and configurations for transformer-based language models in semantic matching tasks, particularly for automated fact-checking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of transformer-based language models has created challenges in model transparency and trustworthiness, with many explanation methods and evaluation metrics making it difficult to select optimal explainability approaches.

Method: Developed o-mega, a hyperparameter optimization tool that systematically explores different explainable AI methods and their configurations within the semantic matching domain, evaluated on a post-claim matching pipeline using social media posts paired with refuting claims.

Result: The tool demonstrates improved transparency in automated fact-checking systems by automatically identifying optimal explainability approaches and configurations.

Conclusion: Automated optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications like misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

### [14] [CORTEX: Collaborative LLM Agents for High-Stakes Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00311)
*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX is a multi-agent LLM architecture for SOC alert triage that uses specialized agents collaborating over real evidence to reduce false positives and improve investigation quality over single-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOC analysts are overwhelmed by thousands of daily alerts with only a small fraction being genuine attacks, leading to alert fatigue and overlooked threats. Existing approaches are either brittle classical pipelines or single-model LLM solutions that struggle with noisy enterprise data and lack transparency.

Method: Multi-agent LLM architecture with specialized agents: behavior-analysis agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external systems, and reasoning agent synthesizes findings into auditable decisions. Also released a dataset of fine-grained SOC investigations from production environments.

Result: CORTEX substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality across diverse enterprise scenarios compared to state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

Conclusion: The multi-agent collaborative approach with specialized agents working over real evidence provides better alert triage performance and transparency than single-model LLM solutions for high-stakes SOC operations.

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.

*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem introduces tokenized procedural memory that stores procedures as compact embeddings, enabling efficient reuse without repeated context overhead while outperforming retrieval-augmented generation and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs inefficiently rely on prompts that must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms for modular reuse of procedures.

Method: TokMem stores recurring procedures as trainable embeddings where each memory token encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers generation, with constant-size overhead and keeping the backbone model frozen.

Result: TokMem consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented generation on 1,000 atomic recall tasks and compositional function-calling tasks while avoiding repeated context overhead and using far fewer parameters than fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TokMem provides a scalable and modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by offering explicit procedural memory for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip is a plug-and-play code compression framework that reduces context size for code LLMs through dual-stage compression, achieving 5.6x compression without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code generation with long contexts faces high API costs and latency bottlenecks. Existing context pruning techniques overlook code-specific structures, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks.

Method: Dual-stage compression: (1) coarse-grained compression identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity, retaining only relevant functions; (2) fine-grained compression segments retained functions into blocks and selects optimal subset under adaptive token budget.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods across multiple tasks (code completion, summarization, question answering), achieving up to 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance.

Conclusion: LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios by effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, advancing code intelligence applications.

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

*Koki Ryu,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using off-the-shelf LLMs for Likert-scale rating prediction, showing that user-written reviews significantly improve performance and can match traditional methods like matrix factorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing LLM outputs for user preferences is an active area, but previous work focused on classification/ranking tasks, not Likert-scale rating prediction which requires both language and mathematical reasoning. This task has industrial applications but LLM utilization remains underexplored.

Method: Comprehensive experiments with eight off-the-shelf LLM models across three datasets, testing different in-context information including user-written reviews, general preference descriptions, and prompting LLMs to generate hypothetical reviews first.

Result: User-written reviews significantly improve LLM rating prediction performance, achieving results comparable to traditional matrix factorization methods. Reviews for concrete items work better than general preference descriptions. Prompting LLMs to generate hypothetical reviews first further enhances performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as a solution for cold-start problems in rating prediction, with user-written reviews being particularly effective and generating hypothetical reviews first providing additional performance gains.

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

*Yawen Xue,Masaya Tsunokake,Yuta Koreeda,Ekant Muljibhai Amin,Takashi Sumiyoshi,Yasuhiro Sogawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent fine-tuning of LLMs for specialized IT operations domain (Hitachi's JP1 middleware) achieves 14% performance improvement over base model on certification exam questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most agentic LLM approaches use in-context learning with few-shot prompts, which results in lengthy inputs and higher computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, but its effectiveness in specialized technical microdomains remains unclear.

Method: Fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets from domain manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs. Used agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced context-answer extractor to improve information relevance during inference.

Result: Achieved 14% performance improvement over base model on JP1 certification exam questions, demonstrating enhanced decision making accuracy and search efficiency.

Conclusion: Agent fine-tuning shows significant potential for domain-specific reasoning in complex microdomains, particularly for specialized IT operations like Hitachi's JP1 middleware.

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

*Pengzhou Cheng,Lingzhong Dong,Zeng Wu,Zongru Wu,Xiangru Tang,Chengwei Qin,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-ScanKit is a probing framework that reveals multimodal GUI agents rely more on memorization than systematic reasoning, showing limited generalization in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal agents for GUI interaction show limited reliability in complex or out-of-domain tasks, raising concerns about whether they are reasoning spuriously rather than genuinely understanding.

Method: Proposed Agent-ScanKit framework with three orthogonal probing paradigms (visual-guided, text-guided, structure-guided) to quantify memorization vs reasoning contributions without accessing model internals.

Result: Evaluation across 5 GUI benchmarks with 18 multimodal agents shows mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic reasoning; models function mainly as retrievers of training-aligned knowledge with limited generalization.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the necessity for robust reasoning modeling in multimodal agents for real-world scenarios and provide insights for developing more reliable agents.

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSS-Speech is a speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates speech without text intermediates, using modality-based layer-splitting and frozen pre-training to preserve text LLM capabilities while adding native speech processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spoken dialogue systems use cascaded pipelines that discard paralinguistic cues and limit expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods still rely on text intermediates, creating a fundamental bottleneck for true speech-to-speech interaction.

Method: Combines modality-based layer-splitting architecture with frozen pre-training strategy to preserve reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech capabilities without text guidance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech performance to text-guided systems while maintaining competitive text performance.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for expressive and efficient end-to-end speech interaction by narrowing the gap between text-guided and direct speech generation.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval is a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates multimodal document comprehension and web interaction tasks for comprehensive evaluation of LLM-driven agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods cannot adequately assess agent capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks, as they lack systematic modeling of multi-step interactions in web environments.

Method: Uses knowledge graphs from multi-source external data as task space, translates semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks via subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths, with multi-stage filtering for quality assurance.

Result: Generated Graph2Eval-Bench dataset with 1,319 tasks that effectively differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings.

Conclusion: Graph2Eval provides an efficient framework for comprehensive agent evaluation, offering a new perspective for assessing reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities in dynamic environments.

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: CopyPasteLLM improves contextual faithfulness in RAG systems by training LLMs to generate high-copying responses from provided context, reducing hallucinations through increased contextual trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of contextual faithfulness in RAG systems where LLMs may not consistently trust provided context, leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability.

Method: Two-stage high-copying response preference training with three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, creating an automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data.

Result: Achieves best performance on FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA with 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over best baseline, requiring only 365 training samples (1/50th of baseline data).

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM recalibrates LLM reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during generation, effectively improving contextual faithfulness through high-copying response strategies.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of insufficient training data for most languages in multilingual speech processing, where existing datasets provide poor performance for the majority of supported languages.

Method: Propose a scalable pipeline with robust media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio from parliamentary recordings.

Result: Extracted over 61k hours of aligned speech from 22 European parliaments, with 19 languages exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours. Achieved 41.8% average reduction in word error rates when finetuning ASR models.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully addresses data scarcity in multilingual speech processing by leveraging parliamentary recordings, demonstrating substantial improvements in ASR performance across multiple languages.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

*Gaotang Li,Ruizhong Qiu,Xiusi Chen,Heng Ji,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that negative log likelihood (NLL) is suboptimal for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, and proposes using prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens depending on model capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning using NLL shows limited generalization, likely because post-training violates NLL's optimality assumptions when models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision is long and noisy.

Method: Study a family of probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness across different conditions through comprehensive experiments on 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains.

Result: Found that objective effectiveness depends on model capability: prior-leaning objectives outperform NLL for strong models, NLL dominates for weak models, and no single objective prevails for intermediate models.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis shows how objectives trade places across the model-capability continuum, providing a principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI-KV is a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancies in GUI interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents face inefficiency challenges when processing long sequences of high-resolution screenshots, making inference slow and memory-bound. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they don't account for GUI-specific spatial and temporal redundancies.

Method: GUI-KV combines two techniques: spatial saliency guidance (augmenting attention scores with L2 norm of hidden states) and temporal redundancy scoring (projecting previous frames' keys onto current frame's key subspace to prune redundant history). Uses uniform budget allocation based on observed uniform attention sparsity across transformer layers.

Result: Outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. In 5-screenshot setting on AgentNetBench, reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over full-cache baseline.

Conclusion: Exploiting GUI-specific spatial and temporal redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance with significant computational savings while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small reasoning models often overthink during tool use, leading to correct tool-arguments being overwritten with incorrect final calls. The paper introduces ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic that monitors log-probability margins to enable early termination and reduce redundant reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small reasoning models exhibit overthinking behavior where they reach correct tool configurations but then continue reasoning and overwrite them with incorrect calls, revealing substantial recoverable headroom in tool reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper introduces ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic that monitors the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at sentence boundaries, triggering termination when this margin becomes small. The approach is evaluated using oracle rollouts and compared against various early-termination baselines adapted to tool use.

Result: On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard, ThinkBrake preserves or improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25% across single turn, non-live and live splits, outperforming various baselines. Oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8% to 94.2% while reducing tokens by 80-94%.

Conclusion: ThinkBrake effectively addresses overthinking in small reasoning models during tool use, providing a practical solution that improves efficiency without requiring additional training, demonstrating significant potential for reducing redundant reasoning in tool reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various

TL;DR: CHIME is a Chinese Internet meme dataset that evaluates LLMs' understanding of viral online content. LLMs struggle with culturally nuanced memes and identifying origins, performing below human levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large language models truly understand viral internet content (memes) that they encounter during training, particularly focusing on Chinese internet culture.

Method: Created CHIME dataset with popular Chinese phrase-based memes annotated with meanings, origins, examples, and types. Designed two evaluation tasks: 1) meme explanation and origin identification, 2) multiple-choice questions selecting appropriate memes for contextual sentences.

Result: LLMs can explain some meme meanings but struggle significantly with culturally nuanced types and consistently fail to provide accurate origins. In multiple-choice tasks, models perform below human levels.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limited understanding of culturally specific internet memes, particularly regarding origins and nuanced cultural contexts. The CHIME dataset enables future research on computational meme understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

### [29] [ReSeek: A Self-Correcting Framework for Search Agents with Instructive Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00568)
*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Yifan Wang,Peiming Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSeek is a self-correcting framework for training LLM-powered search agents that enables dynamic error recovery through a JUDGE action and uses dense process rewards to improve reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RL-based methods for search agents rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, leading to commitment to suboptimal reasoning paths without recovery ability.

Method: Introduces self-correction mechanism with JUDGE action for dynamic error recovery, dense instructive process reward function (correctness + utility rewards), and FictionalHot benchmark to avoid data contamination.

Result: Agents trained with ReSeek significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in task success rate and path faithfulness.

Conclusion: ReSeek provides an effective framework for training search agents with self-correction capabilities, improving reasoning reliability and performance on complex knowledge tasks.

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

*Li Li,Ziyi Wang,Yongliang Wu,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT Vectors are compact representations that encode multi-step reasoning knowledge, addressing the cost and inefficiency of existing Chain-of-Thought methods while achieving comparable performance to fine-tuning approaches with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought implementations (in-context learning and fine-tuning) are costly and inefficient, creating a need for more cost-effective reasoning enhancement methods for Large Language Models.

Method: Proposed CoT Vectors as compact reasoning representations, starting with Extracted CoT Vectors that revealed layer-wise instability, then developing Learnable CoT Vectors optimized under a teacher-student framework for stable guidance.

Result: CoT Vectors outperform existing baselines and achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Analysis reveals insights about latent space structure, information density, and pre-training differences affecting reasoning effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoT Vectors provide an effective, parameter-efficient approach to enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities while offering new insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and architecture optimization for multilingual language diarization, and to generalize effectively to real-world multilingual settings.

Method: Integrates learnable query-based architecture with multilingual awareness and large-scale pretraining on simulated code-switching data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks with 23% to 52% relative improvement over previous methods.

Conclusion: Advances language diarization research and establishes a foundational framework for code-switching speech technologies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first syllabification work for the Tenyidie language using deep learning models, achieving 99.21% accuracy with BLSTM on a newly created dataset of 10,120 syllabified words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie is a low-resource Tibeto-Burman language with no prior work on syllabification, which is important for various NLP applications like morphological analysis and machine translation.

Method: Created a corpus of 10,120 syllabified Tenyidie words and applied four deep learning architectures: LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and Encoder-decoder models on an 80:10:10 train:validation:test split.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set, demonstrating effective syllabification performance for this low-resource language.

Conclusion: The work provides the first syllabification system for Tenyidie and will support numerous NLP applications including morphological analysis, POS tagging, and machine translation for this under-resourced language.

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MCM-DPO, a multi-faceted cross-modal direct preference optimization method that improves alt-text generation by learning from preference pairs without requiring precise annotations, outperforming both DPO and SFT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alt-text generation performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Supervised fine-tuning struggles because it relies on accurate target annotations which are often flawed in user-generated alt-text.

Method: Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO) that optimizes preferences across single, paired, and multi-preference dimensions covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors. Also constructed two large-scale datasets (TAlt and PAlt) with 202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs.

Result: Experimental results show that MCM-DPO consistently outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text generation.

Conclusion: MCM-DPO effectively addresses the limitations of traditional fine-tuning methods for alt-text generation by learning from preference pairs without requiring precise annotations, and the released datasets support further research in this domain.

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

### [34] [Facilitating Cognitive Accessibility with LLMs: A Multi-Task Approach to Easy-to-Read Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00662)
*François Ledoyen,Gaël Dias,Jeremie Pantin,Alexis Lechervy,Fabrice Maurel,Youssef Chahir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can automate Easy-to-Read content generation through multi-task learning combining summarization, simplification, and ETR generation, with RAG enabling out-of-domain generalization and MTL-LoRA achieving best in-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of Easy-to-Read texts for neurodivergent individuals is time-consuming and resource-intensive, creating a need for automated solutions using LLMs.

Method: Proposed multi-task learning approach with two strategies: multi-task RAG for in-context learning and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, tested on Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B using new ETR-fr dataset.

Result: Multi-task setups outperformed single-task baselines across all configurations. RAG-based strategy enabled out-of-domain generalization, while MTL-LoRA achieved best performance in in-domain settings.

Conclusion: Multi-task learning effectively automates ETR content generation, with different strategies offering complementary benefits for in-domain and out-of-domain applications.

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ETR-fr, the first European guideline-compliant dataset for Easy-to-Read text generation, and establishes baselines using parameter-efficient fine-tuning on both PLMs and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual Easy-to-Read text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to scale, limiting access to crucial information for individuals with cognitive impairments. AI-driven solutions face challenges including dataset scarcity and domain adaptation.

Method: Created ETR-fr dataset compliant with European ETR guidelines, implemented parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs and LLMs, and developed an evaluation framework with automatic metrics and human assessments using a 36-question form aligned with guidelines.

Result: PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to out-of-domain texts. The evaluation framework successfully assessed output quality and accessibility.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a scalable solution for ETR text generation, with PLMs showing competitive performance to LLMs while being more efficient for domain adaptation tasks.

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

TL;DR: ALARB is a new Arabic legal reasoning dataset with 13K Saudi commercial court cases, used to evaluate LLMs on complex legal tasks like verdict prediction and reasoning chain completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arabic benchmarks lack focus on multistep reasoning in open-ended contexts, especially in the legal domain where complex reasoning is crucial.

Method: Created dataset from 13K Saudi commercial court cases with facts, court reasoning, verdicts, and cited clauses. Defined challenging legal reasoning tasks and benchmarked Arabic LLMs, including instruction-tuning a 12B parameter model.

Result: Instruction-tuning a 12B parameter model with ALARB significantly improved performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation, reaching GPT-4o level performance.

Conclusion: ALARB effectively evaluates and enhances Arabic LLMs' legal reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the value of domain-specific datasets for improving model performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

*Jenny Kunz,Iben Nyholm Debess,Annika Simonsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores adapting small English LLMs to Faroese using transfer learning from related Scandinavian languages, comparing different tuning methods and evaluating with new benchmarks and human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting language models to Faroese, a low-resource North Germanic language, by leveraging transfer learning from related languages.

Method: Starting from English models, continued pre-training on Scandinavian languages (individually or merged), then fine-tuning on Faroese using both full fine-tuning and LoRA parameter-efficient tuning.

Result: Transfer from related languages is crucial but task-dependent: Icelandic improves linguistic accuracy while Danish boosts comprehension. LoRA enhances linguistic acceptability, while full fine-tuning yields better comprehension and preserves model capabilities.

Conclusion: The optimal adaptation strategy for low-resource languages depends on the specific task, with different source languages and tuning methods offering complementary benefits for linguistic accuracy versus comprehension.

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REAL-MT (Retrieval-Augmented LLM-based Machine Translation) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts remains poorly understood. This paper proposes a noise synthesis framework and new metrics to systematically evaluate REAL-MT robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding REAL-MT reliability under noisy retrieval contexts, which is a common challenge in real-world deployment but poorly studied despite the promise of REAL-MT for knowledge-intensive tasks like idiomatic translation.

Method: Proposed a noise synthesis framework and new metrics to evaluate REAL-MT robustness systematically. Instantiated REAL-MT with Qwen-series models (standard LLMs and large reasoning models) and evaluated performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise.

Result: Low-resource language pairs degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce nonsensical translations. LRMs show no improvement in error correction and are more susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. This stems from attention shift away from source idiom to noisy content while confidence increases despite declining accuracy. Training-free and fine-tuning strategies improve robustness but at the cost of performance in clean contexts.

Conclusion: Current approaches have limitations, highlighting the need for self-verifying integration mechanisms. There is a fundamental trade-off between robustness and performance in clean contexts.

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

*Adi Simhi,Jonathan Herzig,Martin Tutek,Itay Itzhak,Idan Szpektor,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManagerBench is a new benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic managerial scenarios where operational goals conflict with human safety, revealing that frontier LLMs struggle with the safety-pragmatism trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety benchmarks focus on preventing harmful text generation but overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when operational goals conflict with human safety, especially as LLMs evolve into autonomous agents.

Method: The benchmark uses human-validated managerial scenarios that force choices between pragmatic but harmful actions and safe actions with worse operational performance, with a parallel control set measuring pragmatism when harm is directed only at inanimate objects.

Result: Frontier LLMs perform poorly in navigating the safety-pragmatism trade-off - many consistently choose harmful options to advance operational goals, while others become overly safe and ineffective. The misalignment stems from flawed prioritization, not inability to perceive harm.

Conclusion: ManagerBench provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating safe decision-making in agentic behavior when operational goals and alignment values conflict, highlighting critical safety gaps in current LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

TL;DR: ESearch uses Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL) to improve multi-hop reasoning in LLMs by identifying and correcting faulty reasoning steps, achieving significant performance gains over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search-augmented LLMs have limited reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning due to decomposition errors, retrieval missing, and reasoning errors that can derail the entire reasoning process.

Method: ERL framework identifies faulty reasoning steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in place to prevent defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.

Result: ESearch models achieve substantial improvements: 3B model +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, 7B model +5.38% EM and +7.22% F1 over previous SOTA on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle.

Conclusion: Erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs, transforming fragile reasoning into a resilient process.

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluGuard is a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model that mitigates hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation by classifying document-claim pairs and providing evidence-grounded justifications, achieving performance comparable to larger models while using fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are prone to hallucinations, which limits their trustworthiness in real-world applications, creating a need for effective hallucination mitigation methods.

Method: Combines domain-agnostic synthetic dataset from FineWeb with multi-stage curation, synthetic grounded/hallucinated claims, and preference-based fine-tuning using Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone.

Result: Achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy on RAGTruth subset (matching specialized models) and 75.7% BAcc on full benchmark (matching GPT-4o), while using roughly half the parameters of comparable models.

Conclusion: HalluGuard demonstrates that smaller specialized models can effectively mitigate hallucinations in RAG systems while maintaining transparency through evidence-grounded justifications, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

*Zhen Yin,Shenghua Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet is a structure-aware framework for detecting AI-generated scholarly texts that combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning for precise span-level detection and cross-domain robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing AI text detection methods that neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and fail to generalize across disciplines and generators, particularly in scientific writing where authorship integrity is crucial.

Method: Combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence. Integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration for precise span-level detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Shows strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines.

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet substantially surpasses existing baselines and provides a robust solution for AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, with the dataset and source code to be publicly released for reproducibility.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

*Shunfeng Zheng,Yudi Zhang,Meng Fang,Zihan Zhang,Zhitan Wu,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG with foundation models shows promise for expert-level physics reasoning using Olympiad-level problems, but requires specialized multimodal datasets like PhoPile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if retrieval-augmented generation can enhance expert-level physics reasoning in foundation models, inspired by how students review past problems for competitions.

Method: Created PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset for Olympiad-level physics with diagrams, graphs, and equations. Benchmarked RAG-augmented LLMs and LMMs with multiple retrievers.

Result: Integrating retrieval with physics corpora improves model performance, though challenges remain that need further research.

Conclusion: RAG can enhance physics reasoning in foundation models, but specialized multimodal datasets and continued research are needed to address remaining challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

### [44] [Making, not Taking, the Best of N](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00931)
*Ammar Khairi,Daniel D'souza,Marzieh Fadaee,Julia Kreutzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fusion-of-N (FusioN) is a collaborative method that synthesizes the best elements from multiple LLM generations using a judge model, outperforming traditional Best-of-N selection approach in both test-time scaling and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Best-of-N approach discards diverse and potentially useful information by selecting only one winner from multiple generations. The authors propose a collaborative setup where all candidates can contribute to the final output.

Method: FusioN uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most informative elements from each sample in a pool of N generations into a single final answer. It's applied in test-time scaling (sampling from single model) and synthetic data generation (fusing samples from diverse teachers to improve student model).

Result: Extensive benchmarking across 11 languages, 3 diverse tasks and varying model scales shows FusioN consistently outperforms BoN in both test-time scaling and downstream gains from synthetic data generation. The method demonstrates surprising strengths and robustness under challenging settings.

Conclusion: The paper advocates shifting from monolithic quality measurement to embracing the polylithic nature of LLM generations, allowing integration of diverse strengths to unlock latent potential and achieve improvements inaccessible through selection alone.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

*Eileen Pan,Anna Seo Gyeong Choi,Maartje ter Hoeve,Skyler Seto,Allison Koenecke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show up to 20% performance degradation on non-standard English dialects, with three specific grammar rules (existential 'it', zero copula, and y'all) explaining most of the performance drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research has shown degraded LLM performance for under-represented English dialects, and this paper aims to analyze the specific effects of dialectal variations on question answering tasks.

Method: Analyzed the effects of typifying standard American English questions as non-standard dialectal variants on multiple choice question answering tasks, and investigated the grammatical basis of under-performance.

Result: Found up to 20% reduction in accuracy for non-standard English questions, with three specific grammar rules (existential 'it', zero copula, and y'all) explaining the majority of performance degradation across multiple dialects.

Conclusion: Calls for future work to investigate bias mitigation methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures rather than broad dialect categories.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

*Ruqian Zhang,Yijiao Zhang,Juan Shen,Zhongyi Zhu,Annie Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A syntax-guided diffusion language model that enhances text diversity and personalization by incorporating structural supervision and personalized conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often produce generic text with insufficient structural diversity, limiting personalized expression. Diffusion models offer new opportunities to overcome autoregressive limitations.

Method: Proposes cascaded and noncascaded architectures that generate syntactic guidance before text generation, incorporating syntactic information and shared representation mechanisms for personalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority in fluency, diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Qualitative analyses highlight interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances text quality, diversity, and controllability by integrating structural supervision and personalized conditioning in diffusion language models.

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network decision-making processes by uncovering mechanisms and identifying roles of model components like neurons, attention heads, and learned features from Sparse Autoencoders.

Method: Survey methodology analyzing key methods for generating concept descriptions, evolving evaluation metrics (both automated and human), and underlying datasets in this emerging research field.

Result: Synthesis reveals growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation methods and provides comprehensive overview of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The survey outlines the current landscape and identifies key challenges, providing a roadmap for future research to enhance model transparency through improved concept description methods.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid DST model combining rule-based methods with language models (BERT, XGBoost, GPT) shows improved accuracy and coherence in Persian multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based DST is inefficient for open-domain, multi-turn chatbots due to lack of adaptability and coherence for human-like experiences in complex conversations.

Method: Hybrid DST model using rule-based methods with BERT for slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST, and online agents for real-time answer generation.

Result: Significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing methods in Persian-based chatbots, evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach effectively improves DST capabilities, enabling more customized, adaptable, and human-like conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This systematic review analyzes ASR research for African low-resource languages, finding limited datasets, inconsistent evaluation methods, and reproducibility issues, but identifies promising approaches like self-supervised learning and community initiatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African low-resource languages are severely underrepresented in ASR research despite over 2000 languages on the continent, creating barriers to digital inclusion and technological access.

Method: PRISMA 2020 systematic literature review of 2,062 records from major academic databases (DBLP, ACM, Google Scholar, etc.) between 2020-2025, screening 71 studies and analyzing 74 datasets across 111 African languages.

Result: Found 11,206 hours of speech data but fewer than 15% of studies provided reproducible materials. Self-supervised learning shows promise but faces data limitations. Evaluation primarily uses WER with minimal linguistic metrics, limiting effectiveness for tonal languages.

Conclusion: Sustainable ASR development requires stakeholder partnerships, ethically balanced datasets, lightweight models, and active benchmarking. Community-driven initiatives and methodological advances offer pathways for improvement despite current challenges.

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

TL;DR: mR3 is a massively multilingual reward reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being significantly smaller than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM judges work well in English but don't generalize effectively to non-English settings, and there's limited understanding of effective multilingual training strategies for such judges.

Method: Developed mR3 using comprehensive study of data and curriculum selection, including integration of target-language reasoning datasets, trained on 72 languages.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger models (like GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, with effectiveness confirmed through extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: mR3 provides the broadest language coverage in reward modeling to date and demonstrates effective strategies for building high-quality multilingual reward models.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and
code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/mr3.

### [52] [Pay-Per-Search Models are Abstention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01152)
*Mustafa Omer Gul,Claire Cardie,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASH is a training framework that enables LLMs to recognize their knowledge boundaries and selectively abstain from answering questions they cannot reliably answer, using search tool usage as a proxy for abstention through reinforcement learning with pay-per-search rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate answers to questions outside their knowledge boundaries, unlike humans who recognize their limitations and seek help or abstain. The goal is to teach LLMs similar behavior without requiring predefined knowledge boundaries.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with a pay-per-search reward system, where external help-seeking (search tool use) serves as a proxy for abstention. The approach penalizes unnecessary searches while rewarding answer accuracy.

Result: MASH substantially improves selective help-seeking performance over prior approaches, achieving 7.6% higher answer accuracy on multi-hop datasets. It also demonstrates strong off-the-shelf abstention capabilities, distinguishing between answerable and unanswerable questions.

Conclusion: MASH effectively aligns search tool use with parametric knowledge boundaries, enabling LLMs to make appropriate abstention decisions without requiring pre-determined knowledge boundaries, making abstention a by-product of selective help-seeking training.

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models, showing high success rates across multiple encoders and datasets, with proposed fine-tuning defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs inherit vulnerabilities from their components, and audio backdoor attacks pose a significant security threat to speech language models.

Method: Conducted systematic audio backdoor attacks across four speech encoders and three datasets, covering four speech tasks, followed by component-wise analysis and proposed fine-tuning defense.

Result: Attack consistently achieved high success rates ranging from 90.76% to 99.41% across different configurations.

Conclusion: Audio backdoor attacks are highly effective against speech language models, and fine-tuning can mitigate threats from poisoned pretrained encoders.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark to evaluate LLMs' resource allocation decisions, revealing that most models prioritize efficiency over fairness and their allocation strategies are easily influenced by external factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for high-stakes societal decisions, but their underlying values and principles for resource distribution remain unexamined, creating potential risks for human welfare.

Method: Created the SWF Benchmark - a dynamic simulation where LLMs act as sovereign allocators distributing tasks to heterogeneous communities, creating trade-offs between efficiency (ROI) and fairness (Gini coefficient). Evaluated 20 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Three key findings: (1) General conversational ability doesn't predict allocation skill; (2) Most LLMs default to utilitarian orientation favoring productivity over equality; (3) Allocation strategies are vulnerable to output constraints and social influence framing.

Conclusion: Current LLMs pose risks as societal decision-makers, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

*Oussama Gabouj,Kamel Charaf,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Baldwin,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD is a dynamic demonstration-based approach where an LLM is trained to generate input-specific concise demonstrations, outperforming traditional RAG methods under budget constraints and showing strong generalization to OOD domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG approaches rely on static databases which constrain adaptability and can result in irrelevant demonstrations, limiting LLM performance despite their strong capabilities across diverse tasks.

Method: Train an LLM model to generate input-specific concise demonstrations, creating a Generative Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD) that dynamically tailors demonstrations to each input rather than using static databases.

Result: GRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM questions, showing robust generalization to OOD domains like physics, chemistry, and computer science. It also enables smaller trained models to effectively guide larger target models.

Conclusion: GRAD introduces a scalable demonstration generator model representing the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning paradigm in resource-constrained settings, offering better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

Motivation: To address the problem of mode collapse in post-training alignment of LLMs, which reduces model diversity, by identifying the root cause as typicality bias in preference data rather than algorithmic limitations.

Method: Theoretical formalization of typicality bias, empirical verification on preference datasets, and introduction of Verbalized Sampling - a prompting strategy that asks models to verbalize probability distributions over multiple responses.

Result: VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (1.6-2.1x diversity increase), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation while maintaining factual accuracy and safety. More capable models benefit more from VS.

Conclusion: The work provides a data-centric perspective on mode collapse and offers a practical inference-time solution (Verbalized Sampling) that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity in LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPHERE is a model editing method that uses hyperspherical energy regularization to stabilize neuron weight distributions during sequential updates, preventing catastrophic forgetting while enabling reliable knowledge editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need constant updates but sequential editing often causes catastrophic forgetting and destabilizes representations. The authors seek to understand and mitigate performance degradation in sequential model editing.

Method: Proposed SPHERE (Sparse Projection for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing) - an HE-driven regularization strategy that identifies sparse space complementary to principal hyperspherical directions and projects new knowledge onto it to attenuate perturbations.

Result: SPHERE outperforms best baseline in editing capability by average 16.41% on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B), while better preserving general model performance.

Conclusion: SPHERE offers a principled path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing by maintaining hyperspherical uniformity to prevent catastrophic forgetting during sequential updates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral SISR is challenging due to difficulty in restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across wavelengths, limiting conventional deep learning models.

Method: Introduces Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF) module integrated into 2D CNNs, combining spectral unmixing with spectral-spatial feature extraction, and proposes Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function.

Result: Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets show competitive performance with reduced model complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid deep learning model effectively addresses hyperspectral SISR challenges through spectral-spatial fusion and custom loss functions.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [59] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework to characterize hallucinations in large language and vision models, linking them to specific mechanisms in the model lifecycle to address underlying causes rather than surface symptoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in AI models can propagate misinformation causing financial and operational harm, and current understanding is fragmented, leading to solutions that only address symptoms rather than root causes.

Method: Developed a unified multi-level framework for characterizing hallucinations across image and text modalities, using a task-modality interleaved approach to link hallucinations to specific model lifecycle mechanisms.

Result: Investigations revealed that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases, providing insights into their underlying causes.

Conclusion: The survey establishes a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems by providing a coherent understanding of their mechanisms.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustVLA improves multi-modal robustness in Vision-Language-Action models against 17 perturbations across actions, instructions, environments, and observations, achieving significant performance gains and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models focus only on visual robustness, ignoring multi-modal perturbations that occur in real-world deployment across actions, instructions, environments, and observations.

Method: Proposes RobustVLA with offline robust optimization for output robustness against worst-case action noise, and input robustness by enforcing consistent actions across semantically equivalent input variations. Uses multi-armed bandit formulation to identify most harmful perturbations.

Result: Achieves 12.6% gain on pi0 backbone and 10.4% on OpenVLA backbone across 17 perturbations, 50.6x faster inference than visual-robust VLAs, and 65.6% gain on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: RobustVLA effectively addresses multi-modal robustness in VLAs, demonstrating superior performance across diverse perturbations and real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC is a framework that shifts instruction data curation from task-specific heuristics to intrinsic capability analysis, enabling effective training with only 5% of original data while surpassing full-data performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning treats models as black boxes and overlooks latent capabilities, causing regressions when reducing dataset size. There's a need for more principled data curation that leverages intrinsic model capabilities.

Method: CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities unsupervised from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes training data to capabilities via influence estimation, and curates capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.

Result: With only 5% of the original data, CADC surpasses full-data training performance on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating significant data efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: Intrinsic capabilities are fundamental building blocks of model learning, and CADC establishes a principled paradigm for instruction data curation that transforms black-box tuning into a controllable, capability-driven process.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C³B is a multicultural, multitask, multilingual benchmark for evaluating cultural awareness in MLLMs, featuring over 2000 images and 18000 QA pairs across three progressively difficult tasks from visual recognition to cultural content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack progressed difficulty in task design and cross-lingual tasks, and use real-world images that typically contain only one culture, making them relatively easy for MLLMs.

Method: Proposed C³B benchmark with three progressively difficult tasks: basic visual recognition, higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and cultural content generation, using comics-based images to increase complexity.

Result: Evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs revealed a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance, demonstrating substantial challenges for current models.

Conclusion: C³B poses significant challenges for current MLLMs and encourages future research to advance cultural awareness capabilities in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [63] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of gender bias in six TTI models reveals systematic occupational stereotypes and model-specific variations in gender representation, with prompt wording significantly influencing demographic outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gender representation and occupational stereotypes in state-of-the-art text-to-image models, as these models are increasingly used in professional and creative contexts but often amplify social biases.

Method: Generated 100 images for each combination of five hospital professions and five portrait qualifiers using six open-weight TTI models, then analyzed gender representation patterns across models and prompt variations.

Result: All models showed systematic stereotypes: nurses exclusively depicted as women, surgeons predominantly as men. Model-specific differences emerged - Qwen-Image and SDXL enforced rigid male dominance, FLUX.1-dev skewed female, while others showed varying sensitivity to prompt formulation. Portrait qualifiers like 'corporate' reinforced male depictions and 'beautiful' favored female ones.

Conclusion: Gender bias in TTI models is both systematic and model-specific, with prompt wording playing a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. Results highlight the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance to prevent reinforcement of occupational stereotypes.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [64] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer is a reinforcement learning framework that can steal prompt templates from MLLMs using only a small set of example images, reducing attack costs to under 13% of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt trading in MLLMs creates security risks where valuable prompts can be stolen, exposing a vulnerability in the emerging text-to-image marketplace.

Method: Treats template stealing as sequential decision making using reinforcement learning with similarity-based feedback signals as reward functions to explore prompt space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks while reducing total attack cost to under 13% of existing baselines, and effectively generalizes across different image styles.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent security threats in prompt trading and lays groundwork for developing protective standards in the MLLMs marketplace.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDCT is an automated method to test if Vision-Language Models' explanations match their actual reasoning by generating counterfactual images and measuring consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often produce plausible-sounding explanations that don't reflect the true causal factors behind predictions, creating risks for AI governance and reliability.

Method: EDCT automatically: (1) gets model's answer and explanation, (2) parses explanation into testable concepts, (3) generates counterfactual image edits via inpainting, (4) computes Counterfactual Consistency Score using LLM analysis.

Result: Testing on 120 OK-VQA examples across multiple VLMs revealed substantial faithfulness gaps where explanations didn't match actual reasoning.

Conclusion: EDCT provides automated verification and regulator-aligned audit artifacts to detect when VLMs' cited concepts fail causal tests, addressing explanation faithfulness issues.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [66] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe is a training-free framework that addresses MLLMs' poor performance on high-resolution images by decoupling key information from background interference through attention-based token alignment and layout-preserving reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images not due to object size limitations as commonly believed, but because of complex background interference that distracts the models from focusing on relevant visual content.

Method: HiDe uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to identify key information tokens and align them with target visual regions, then employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to separate these regions from background and reconstruct compact representations while maintaining spatial layouts.

Result: HiDe achieves new SOTA on V*Bench (92.1% for Qwen2.5-VL 7B, 91.6% for InternVL3 8B), HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, surpassing RL methods while using 75% less memory than previous training-free approaches.

Conclusion: The key limitation in MLLM performance on high-resolution images is background interference rather than object size, and HiDe effectively addresses this through attention-based decoupling without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

TL;DR: FSDENet is a dual-domain network that integrates spatial and frequency domains to enhance remote sensing image segmentation, particularly addressing edge ambiguities in grayscale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (shadows, low-contrast regions) in remote sensing image segmentation and fully leverage spatial information.

Method: Uses spatial processing for multi-scale features, Fast Fourier Transform for global frequency information, and Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high/low-frequency components for boundary refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Conclusion: FSDENet effectively integrates spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, significantly improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will

*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end DSE framework for CNN compression using LRF with novel rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, and multi-method integration that achieves better compression than uniform approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRF faces challenges in optimal rank selection, large design space, long fine-tuning times, and limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.

Method: Uses feature map similarity for rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, integrates 3 LRF techniques for Conv layers and 3 for FC layers applied selectively per-layer, and combines multiple LRF methods within a single model.

Result: Achieves substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on 14 CNN models across 8 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively addresses LRF challenges and demonstrates that combining multiple LRF methods yields better compression than uniform approaches.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIG-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models' understanding of One-Image Guides - visual formats combining text, imagery, and symbols designed for human comprehension. The benchmark uses a semi-automated multi-agent annotation pipeline and tests 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of MLLMs' capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides is insufficiently explored, despite their importance in representing human perception and structured information presentation.

Method: Developed OIG-Bench benchmark with a semi-automated annotation pipeline using multiple intelligent agents to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs. Evaluated 29 proprietary and open-source MLLMs.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B performed best with 77% overall accuracy. All models showed notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning. The multi-agent annotation system outperformed all MLLMs in image captioning.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships in One-Image Guides. The multi-agent annotation system shows promise as both a high-quality image description generator and tool for future dataset construction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Scaffolding stage uses supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars to instill geospatial thinking paradigm; 2) Elevating stage employs GRPO-based reinforcement learning on weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy for verifiable reward signals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating effective geospatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Geo-R1 successfully extends geospatial modeling to reasoning-first post-training and provides a scalable approach for developing geospatial reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

*Hanjiang Hu,Bowei Li,Ziwei Wang,Tianhao Wei,Casidhe Hutchison,Eric Sample,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural network pruning method based on an Unbiased and Smooth Neuron (USN) metric to address over-parameterization in certified robustness against semantic transformations like brightness and contrast perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current certified training and robustness certification methods face challenges with over-parameterization in deep neural networks, which hinders tightness and scalability for verifying robustness against semantic transformations.

Method: Introduces USN metric to identify certifiable robustness, then prunes neurons with low USN while retaining high-USN neurons. Also proposes a Wasserstein distance loss to concentrate pruned neurons across layers.

Result: Validated on robust keypoint detection with brightness and contrast perturbations, achieving superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The USN-based pruning method effectively addresses over-parameterization while preserving model expressiveness, enabling better certified robustness against semantic transformations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

*Abu Hasnat Mohammad Rubaiyat,Jordan Vincent,Colin Olson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method using transport-based mathematical modeling and signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) to represent pixels as deformed template patterns, with unsupervised subspace modeling for background signal detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral anomaly detection faces challenges in complex real-world environments with limited prior knowledge of target signatures, requiring improved techniques for civilian and military applications.

Method: Proposes a transport-based model viewing pixels as deformed template patterns, represents them in SCDT domain, and uses unsupervised subspace modeling to learn background signals for anomaly detection.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The transport-based approach with SCDT representation and subspace modeling provides an effective solution for hyperspectral anomaly detection in challenging environments.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: MOLM is a watermarking framework that uses key-dependent LoRA adapters to embed imperceptible watermarks in generative models, achieving robustness against various attacks while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about detecting and attributing synthetically generated images, as existing watermarking methods are fragile to distortions, susceptible to removal, and expensive to update.

Method: Formulates encoding as key-dependent perturbation of generative model parameters using Mixture of LoRA Markers - binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters in residual and attention blocks, avoiding key-specific retraining.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression, regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: MOLM provides an effective watermarking solution with desired properties of imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness for generative models.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CROWD is a combinatorial framework for Open-World Object Detection that addresses semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting through strategic unknown instance mining and joint representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OWOD approaches suffer from semantic confusion between known/unknown classes and catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy.

Method: CROWD-Discover uses Submodular Conditional Gain functions to mine unknown instances distinct from known objects, while CROWD-Learn employs combinatorial objectives to disentangle representations and maintain discriminative coherence.

Result: Achieves 2.83% and 2.05% improvements in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB benchmarks, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: CROWD effectively mitigates confusion and forgetting in open-world detection through combinatorial discovery and learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Latent Diffusion Models have shown advantages in remote sensing, there's limited research on improving the intrinsic latent space representation. The authors aim to enhance VAE's latent space specifically for satellite imagery by leveraging frequency-domain information.

Method: Proposed ExpDWT-VAE uses dual branches: one processes spatial domain with convolutions, while the other extracts frequency features via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolution, and inverse DWT reconstruction. The branches merge to create integrated spatial-frequency representation, refined through convolution and Gaussian mapping.

Result: Experimental results on a new satellite imagery dataset from TerraFly mapping system show the method effectively enhances latent space representation across multiple performance metrics.

Conclusion: The ExpDWT-VAE method successfully improves latent space representation for satellite imagery by integrating spatial and frequency-domain features, demonstrating efficacy in enhancing Latent Diffusion Models for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for real-world perceptual artifacts in first-person vision such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift, which limits model robustness in practical deployment.

Method: Proposed BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion using shared latent representation, enhanced with EgoAnchor mechanism for feature modulation based on distilled historical features.

Result: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The EgoTraj-Bench benchmark and BiFlow model provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems resilient to real-world ego-centric perception challenges, bridging the gap between training assumptions and deployment reality.

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Motivation: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of automated methods for chest radiograph interpretation by comparing supervised CNNs with zero-shot vision-language models.

Method: Comparative analysis between supervised lightweight CNN and zero-shot BiomedCLIP VLM on pneumonia detection (PneumoniaMNIST) and tuberculosis detection (Shenzhen TB dataset), with decision threshold calibration applied to the VLM.

Result: After calibration, BiomedCLIP achieved superior F1-score of 0.8841 vs CNN's 0.8803 for pneumonia detection, and improved from 0.4812 to 0.7684 (close to CNN's 0.7834) for tuberculosis detection.

Conclusion: Proper calibration is essential for unlocking the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or outperform task-specific supervised models in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's

leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match

Conclusion: Results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation solutions in critical applications like meningioma RT planning, and the code is publicly available.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and

involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with subject-consistent generation due to difficulty parsing prompts with complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects.

Method: Proposes MLLM-DiT framework where a pretrained multimodal large language model performs cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles/attributes/interactions, generating subject-aware hidden states to condition the diffusion transformer.

Result: Experiments on OpenS2V benchmark show superior performance in subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.

Conclusion: BindWeave effectively addresses the challenge of subject-consistent video generation across diverse scenarios through deep cross-modal reasoning and entity grounding.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCNet is a self-supervised denoising method that addresses spectral bias in paired noisy image denoising by controlling frequency learning through band selection, Lipschitz-constrained optimization, and a spectral separation module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images suffer from poor preservation of high-frequency structural details and tend to learn high-frequency noise during training, as revealed through spectral bias analysis.

Method: Proposes SCNet with three components: frequency band selection strategy for faster convergence, Lipschitz-constrained parameter optimization to limit high-frequency noise learning, and SSR module for spectral separation and low-rank reconstruction to preserve high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate SCNet's effectiveness in improving denoising performance while better preserving image details.

Conclusion: SCNet successfully addresses spectral bias limitations in self-supervised denoising through frequency-domain control mechanisms, achieving improved detail preservation and noise reduction.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

*Atif Belal,Heitor R. Medeiros,Marco Pedersoli,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework for vision-language object detectors that improves performance under domain shift using IoU-weighted entropy and image-conditioned prompt selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language object detectors perform well in zero-shot recognition but degrade under domain shift, requiring adaptation methods to maintain performance across different domains.

Method: Uses two main techniques: 1) IoU-weighted entropy objective that focuses adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters, and 2) image-conditioned prompt selection that ranks and fuses the most informative prompts with detector logits.

Result: Shows consistent improvements over zero-shot and TTA baselines across diverse distribution shifts including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, and common corruptions on YOLO-World and Grounding DINO detectors.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA effectively adapts vision-language object detectors to domain shifts through proposal clustering and intelligent prompt selection, demonstrating robust performance across various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a rigorous testbed that unifies visual perception, symbolic manipulation, and arithmetic consistency for advancing compositional reasoning across vision and symbols.

Method: Generated 1.4M instances of matchstick equation correction tasks with both text-guided and purely visual settings, systematically varying digit scale, move complexity, solution multiplicity, and operators.

Result: Evaluations of 14 vision-language models revealed substantial limitations: closed-source models only succeed on simple cases, open-source models fail in visual regime, while humans achieve over 90% accuracy.

Conclusion: MathSticks establishes a rigorous benchmark that highlights current AI limitations in compositional reasoning and provides a foundation for advancing vision-symbol integration.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework for generalist anomaly detection that uses both normal and anomalous samples as references, outperforming previous methods that only used normal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous GAD methods only used normal samples as references, ignoring valuable information from anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios.

Method: NAGL framework with two components: Residual Mining (RM) extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals, and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL) adaptively learns anomaly features through residual mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show the method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first work to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection, enabling more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion) is an efficient feature extraction technique that enhances image-based iterative method selection for sparse linear systems by fusing relative image features with absolute numerical values, preventing feature ambiguity and improving selection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based selection approaches for sparse linear systems suffer from feature ambiguity where distinct matrices can have identical image representations, leading to suboptimal method selection and reduced robustness.

Method: RAF simultaneously extracts and fuses image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical values as absolute features, creating comprehensive matrix representations that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices.

Result: Evaluation on SuiteSparse and BMCMat datasets showed solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s (5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based approaches) and achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RAF effectively prevents feature ambiguity in image-based iterative method selection, improving accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based approaches for sparse linear systems.

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative prior method for refining 3D hand poses under severe occlusion using affordance-aware textual descriptions from vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing 3D hand poses when large portions are heavily occluded by leveraging contextual knowledge about object affordances.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based generative model that learns hand pose distributions conditioned on affordance descriptions inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM).

Result: Significantly improves hand pose estimation on HOGraspNet dataset with severe occlusions, outperforming recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement without contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: Affordance-guided refinement using textual descriptions enables more accurate and functionally coherent hand pose reconstruction under severe occlusion conditions.

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: EPIC is a progressive learning framework that improves multi-modal large model efficiency through token compression with reduced training difficulty via consistency distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in MLLMs, and existing compression methods overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by feature space perturbations from token compression.

Method: Progressive Consistency Distillation framework that decomposes feature perturbations into token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, using token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation with teacher model guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: EPIC successfully addresses the training difficulty in token compression for MLLMs through progressive consistency distillation, achieving efficient models with maintained performance.

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench is a standardized benchmark for evaluating foundation models in echocardiography, unifying 8 public datasets across 9 tasks to address the lack of comparability in current research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are transforming medical imaging but lack standardized evaluation in echocardiography due to challenges like noisy data, frame redundancy, limited public datasets, and private evaluations that restrict comparability.

Method: Created CardioBench by unifying 8 public datasets into a standardized suite with 4 regression and 5 classification tasks. Evaluated cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols.

Result: Found complementary strengths: temporal modeling critical for functional regression, retrieval robust under distribution shift, domain-specific text encoders capture physiological meaning. General-purpose encoders transfer well but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology.

Conclusion: CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point for echocardiography foundation models, providing actionable insights to guide future model design and enabling standardized evaluation across the field.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

### [91] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded diffusion framework for 3D hand pose reconstruction that combines probabilistic modeling with coarse-to-fine refinement to address pose ambiguities and capture pose uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic models struggle with pose ambiguities from self-occlusions and complex articulations, while probabilistic methods are limited to single-stage estimation without refinement capabilities.

Method: Two-stage cascaded diffusion: 1) Joint diffusion model samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, 2) Mesh Latent Diffusion Model reconstructs 3D hand mesh conditioned on joint samples, trained with diverse hypotheses in learned latent space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 datasets while effectively modeling pose distributions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines probabilistic modeling with cascaded refinement to overcome limitations of both deterministic and single-stage probabilistic approaches for 3D hand pose reconstruction.

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forestpest-YOLO is a detection framework optimized for detecting small, occluded agricultural pests in forestry remote sensing imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance through lossless downsampling, cross-stage feature fusion, and refined training objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments is challenging due to small target size, heavy occlusion, visual similarity to background clutter, loss of fine-grained features, and extreme data imbalance in conventional object detection models.

Method: Builds on YOLOv8 with three innovations: 1) SPD-Conv for lossless downsampling to preserve small target details, 2) CSPOK cross-stage feature fusion block for enhanced multi-scale representation and background noise suppression, 3) VarifocalLoss to focus training on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on the self-constructed ForestPest dataset show Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance with marked improvements in detecting small, occluded pests, significantly outperforming established baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed Forestpest-YOLO framework effectively addresses the challenges of pest detection in forestry remote sensing through synergistic architectural improvements and training optimization, demonstrating superior performance for this specific application domain.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models like MaskDINO can achieve near-parity performance with extensively trained traditional models (YoloV9) using only 1-3% of the training data for mold colony detection on Petri dishes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that exhaustive annotation is not necessary for new vision tasks, challenging the conventional approach that requires manual annotation of large datasets for microbiology automation.

Method: Compiled a dataset of 5000 Petri dish images with bounding boxes, simulating traditional data collection and few-shot scenarios. Benchmarked vision foundation models against traditional baselines on task-specific metrics.

Result: MaskDINO attained near-parity with extensively trained YoloV9 when fine-tuned on only 150 images, and retained competitive performance with just 25 images (reliable on ≈70% of samples).

Conclusion: Data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with only a fraction of required data, enabling faster development of automated microbiological systems with superior upper-bound performance.

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE-MTL methods rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during STL to MTL transition.

Method: ASE with LoRA-based MoE where shared experts get router-computed gating weights normalized with sparse experts, plus fine-grained experts by increasing LoRA expert count while reducing rank proportionally.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Context benchmark show ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and validates fine-grained designs for MTL.

Conclusion: ASE facilitates better STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization and cooperation, and enables more effective knowledge sharing under comparable parameter budget.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

TL;DR: ArbInterp is a flexible video frame interpolation framework that can generate frames at any timestamp and of any length, overcoming limitations of fixed-frame methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative video frame interpolation methods can only synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking flexibility to adjust frame rates or sequence duration.

Method: Proposes Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE) for any-timestamp interpolation and decomposes long sequences into segments with appearance-motion decoupled conditioning for seamless transitions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across all interpolation scenarios (2x to 32x) with higher fidelity and better spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: ArbInterp provides a flexible and efficient solution for arbitrary video frame interpolation, enabling fine-grained control over frame generation.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF is a novel 3D style transfer method that reengineers the NeRF pipeline with multi-level feature adaptation and dynamic style injection for superior content preservation and artistic stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based style transfer methods integrate style statistics into original NeRF pipelines, leading to suboptimal results in both content preservation and artistic stylization.

Method: Proposes multi-level feature adaptor to generate multi-level feature grid representation, dynamic style injection module to extract and adaptively integrate style features, and multi-level cascade decoder for final stylized view generation. Also supports omni-view style transfer with 3D style references.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate outstanding performance for 3D style transfer, effectively preserving multi-scale spatial structures while transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF achieves superior 3D style transfer by specifically reengineering the NeRF pipeline for stylization tasks through multi-level feature representation and dynamic style integration.

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Method: Integrates LVLMs with semantic pattern matching and iterative self-questioning refinement using optimized domain-specific prompting and recursive verification.

Result: Achieves 98% accuracy in defect detection and 85%-98% annotation accuracy across defect categories, with 80%-92% accuracy on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: ADPT provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset construction that supports downstream tasks like transfer learning in structural damage assessment.

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

### [99] [Disentangling Foreground and Background for vision-Language Navigation via Online Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00604)
*Yunbo Xu,Xuesong Zhang,Jia Li,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFA is a vision-language navigation strategy that augments foreground and background features separately to improve generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE and R2R benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN approaches underutilize the distinct roles of foreground (semantic cues) and background (spatial connectivity) in visual observations, which could enhance navigation generalization.

Method: Uses semantically-enhanced landmark identification to disentangle foreground/background features, then employs consensus-driven online augmentation with two-stage voting to consolidate feature preferences based on instructions and locations.

Result: Boosts baseline generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE and R2R benchmarks.

Conclusion: Separate foreground-background feature augmentation with consensus-driven strategy effectively improves VLN agent generalization and performance.

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [100] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR is a novel approach that achieves both robustness and context-awareness in visual recognition by treating localization as integral to recognition, enabling object-centric and context-aware modeling without compromising either.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning often leads to over-reliance on background context (shortcut learning), limiting model robustness in real-world settings. Existing approaches suppress background but sacrifice valuable context information.

Method: RCOR treats localization as an integral part of recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modeling, followed by robust non-parametric fusion. It enables localization before recognition even in complex scenes.

Result: RCOR improves performance of both supervised models and VLMs on datasets with in-domain and out-of-domain backgrounds, even without fine-tuning. It works effectively on complex scenes like ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: RCOR demonstrates that localization before recognition is possible in complex scenes, achieving both robustness and context-awareness without compromising either aspect.

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

*Mengfei Xia,Nan Xue,Jiapeng Zhu,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using an unconditional discriminator (UCD) in GAN training to improve convergence and avoid mode collapse by removing condition injection, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-64.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN training struggles with convergence and mode collapse due to redundant shortcuts from conditional discriminators that disable meaningful knowledge extraction.

Method: Employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD) where the discriminator extracts comprehensive features without condition injection, promoting Nash equilibrium and better supervision for the generator.

Result: Achieved 1.47 FID on ImageNet-64, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models with high efficiency.

Conclusion: UCD provides theoretical compatibility with vanilla GAN theory and can be implemented as a plug-in solution to significantly improve GAN performance and convergence.

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

*Yannick Hauri,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Till Aczel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces virtual fashion photo-shoot task to transform garment images into editorial fashion imagery with dynamic poses and contextual narratives, using a new large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion image generation focuses on narrow tasks like virtual try-on in clean studio environments, lacking the richness of editorial fashion with dynamic poses, diverse locations, and visual storytelling.

Method: Constructed the first large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs using an automated retrieval pipeline that combines visual-language reasoning with object-level localization to align garments across domains. Created dataset with three quality levels: high (10K pairs), medium (50K pairs), and low (300K pairs).

Result: Built a comprehensive dataset that bridges e-commerce and fashion media domains, enabling models to move beyond catalog-style generation toward creative, atmospheric fashion imagery with storytelling elements.

Conclusion: The virtual fashion photo-shoot task and accompanying dataset provide a foundation for generating fashion imagery that captures the creativity, atmosphere, and narrative richness of editorial fashion, advancing beyond current limited generation approaches.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

*Jiayao Jiang,Siran Peng,Bin Liu,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel face forgery detection method using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with landmark-guided attention to improve artifact detection in deepfakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN and Transformer-based methods have limitations in modeling the complex, non-linear nature of forgery artifacts in deepfakes.

Method: Proposed LAKAN module that uses facial landmarks as structural priors to dynamically generate KAN parameters, guiding image encoder to focus on critical facial regions with artifacts.

Result: Achieved superior performance on multiple public datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The combination of geometric priors with KAN's learnable splines creates an effective approach for face forgery detection.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReFlux is a concept attack method designed to test the robustness of concept erasure in rectified flow-based text-to-image models like Flux, using reverse-attention optimization and velocity guidance to reactivate suppressed concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods and attack evaluations are tailored for Stable Diffusion and show limited effectiveness when applied to next-generation rectified flow transformers like Flux, creating a need for specialized assessment tools.

Method: The approach uses reverse-attention optimization to reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention, reinforced by velocity-guided dynamics for robust concept reactivation and consistency-preserving objectives to maintain layout and unrelated content.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating concept erasure robustness in rectified flow transformers.

Conclusion: ReFlux successfully addresses the limitations of existing concept attack methods for Flux models and provides the first specialized assessment tool for evaluating concept erasure robustness in rectified flow-based text-to-image frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles, combining camera semantic richness with radar distance accuracy for cost-effective perception. Current map segmentation faces challenges in accuracy and real-time performance.

Method: Efficient BEV map segmentation architecture using camera-radar fusion with advanced loss functions and lightweight head design to improve perception results.

Result: Achieves 53.5 mIoU comparable to large models while setting new benchmark for inference time with 260% improvement over strongest baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed camera-radar fusion approach provides an effective solution for real-time map segmentation with high accuracy and significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Conclusion: OTTER effectively bridges closed-set consistency with open-vocabulary flexibility for multi-modal tagging applications.

Abstract: We introduce OTTER, a unified open-set multi-label tagging framework that
harmonizes the stability of a curated, predefined category set with the
adaptability of user-driven open tags. OTTER is built upon a large-scale,
hierarchically organized multi-modal dataset, collected from diverse online

TL;DR: Proposes SpecMCD, a weakly supervised cloud detection method combining spectral features and multi-scale scene-level deep networks to generate accurate pixel-level cloud masks from satellite images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds degrade optical satellite image quality, limiting applications. Current deep learning methods struggle with thin clouds and low-quality training samples, leaving room for improvement in cloud detection accuracy.

Method: Uses progressive training with multi-scale scene-level dataset, combines multi-scale probability maps with cloud thickness maps, and applies adaptive thresholds with distance-weighted optimization to generate binary cloud masks.

Result: Tested on WDCD and GF1MS-WHU datasets (60 Gaofen-1 multispectral images), SpecMCD achieved over 7.82% improvement in F1-score compared to other weakly supervised methods like WDCD and WSFNet.

Conclusion: SpecMCD demonstrates superiority and potential for cloud detection under different cloud coverage conditions, effectively addressing challenges with thin clouds and training sample quality.

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

*Beomsu Kim,Byunghee Cha,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Align Your Tangent (AYT), a method that accelerates Consistency Model training by using manifold-aligned tangents to reduce oscillatory behavior and improve convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency Models require prolonged training with large batch sizes to achieve competitive sample quality. The authors discovered that CM tangents near convergence are oscillatory and move parallel to the data manifold rather than toward it.

Method: The authors propose a new loss function called manifold feature distance (MFD) that provides manifold-aligned tangents pointing toward the data manifold, which mitigates oscillatory behavior during training.

Result: AYT accelerates CM training by orders of magnitude, outperforms LPIPS metric, and enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality.

Conclusion: The proposed AYT method effectively addresses the oscillatory tangent problem in Consistency Models, leading to significantly faster training and improved performance even with small batch sizes.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

*Huaying Li,Liansheng Wang,Yinran Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes U2-rPCA, an unsupervised unfolded robust PCA method for ultrasound microvascular imaging that preserves interpretability and doesn't require ground truth labels, outperforming existing methods by 2-10 dB CNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clutter filtering methods (SVD, rPCA) have limitations in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow separation. Supervised deep learning methods face interpretability issues and lack ground truth labels for training.

Method: Unfolds iteratively reweighted least squares rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization, adds sparse-enhancement unit to capture micro-flow signals, and trains adaptively on part of image sequence.

Result: Outperformed SVD-based method, rPCA baseline, and another deep learning filter on in-silico and in-vivo datasets, improving contrast-to-noise ratio by 2-10 dB in power Doppler images.

Conclusion: U2-rPCA successfully addresses interpretability and ground truth limitations while achieving superior performance in ultrasound microvascular imaging clutter filtering.

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain adaptation framework for brain vessel segmentation that uses image-to-image translation with disentanglement techniques to handle multiple imaging modalities and datasets without domain-specific model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain vessel morphology is complex and current segmentation models focus on single modalities, but comprehensive cerebrovascular understanding requires handling multiple acquisition procedures and domain gaps.

Method: Employ disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate image properties, preserving spatial information (shapes/locations) while adapting vessel appearances through image-to-image translation.

Result: Effectively bridges large domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types, demonstrating robustness and versatility in cerebrovascular segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for accurate cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios using domain adaptation methodologies, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

*Leah Bar,Liron Mor Yosef,Shai Zucker,Neta Shoham,Inbar Seroussi,Nir Sochen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified geometric and probabilistic framework for generative AI, introducing the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM) that interprets diffusion models as projections onto image manifolds and achieves superior performance compared to Latent Diffusion Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI approaches often overlook the geometric structure of image datasets and focus solely on probabilistic methods, treating probability distributions in latent spaces as uninteresting or predefined. The paper aims to unify geometric and probabilistic perspectives.

Method: Developed a geometric framework with kernel-based probabilistic methods, interpreting diffusion models as projection mechanisms onto manifolds of "good images". Created the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM) operating in both pixel and latent spaces.

Result: The Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in image restoration and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives, providing a new interpretation of diffusion models and demonstrating improved performance through the MPPM approach.

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores binary encoding methods to reduce computational complexity in multi-class medical image segmentation, but finds they underperform compared to standard one-hot encoding despite efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory challenges of medical image segmentation with many classes, where standard one-hot encoding scales linearly with class count.

Method: Proposed binary encoding approaches including vanilla binary encoding, error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees.

Result: Binary encoding reduced computational requirements to logarithmic scaling but achieved significantly lower segmentation performance (DSC 39.3-73.8) compared to one-hot encoding (DSC 82.4) in whole brain parcellation with 108 classes.

Conclusion: While binary encodings offer computational efficiency, they face challenges in achieving state-of-the-art segmentation quality, highlighting the need for future research on compact encoding strategies.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

### [113] [Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681)
*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an event-image knowledge distillation framework using CLIP to enable open-vocabulary object detection on event data, overcoming modality gaps through spatial attention-based distillation and a hybrid SNN-CNN architecture for optimal temporal feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have advantages for object detection but lack texture/color information, making open-vocabulary detection challenging. Current methods are limited to predefined categories and cannot generalize to novel objects. Directly applying CLIP to event data is ineffective due to modality gaps.

Method: Uses event-image knowledge distillation: image frames as teacher model inputs guide event-based student model to learn CLIP's representations via spatial attention-based distillation. Implements hybrid SNN-CNN framework where SNN adaptively determines optimal event segmentation moments to preserve temporal information, and CNNs process features for detection.

Result: The framework enables open-vocabulary object detection on event data by bridging the modality gap between images and event streams, allowing the system to detect previously unseen objects.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge distillation approach successfully transfers CLIP's semantic understanding to event data, enabling robust open-vocabulary detection while preserving crucial temporal information through adaptive SNN-based segmentation.

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

*Steffen Meinert,Philipp Schlinge,Nils Strodthoff,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoMask uses image segmentation foundation models to improve truthfulness of prototype-based XAI methods by restricting saliency maps to semantic image patches, achieving competitive performance on fine-grained classification datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototype-based XAI methods rely on post-hoc saliency techniques that have reliability and quality issues. The authors aim to improve the truthfulness of mapping between embedding and input space by using segmentation models to constrain saliency computations to semantic patches.

Method: ProtoMask uses image segmentation foundation models to generate segmentation masks, crops images using bounding boxes from each mask, and processes each cropped region individually in a novel architecture. This restricts saliency map computation to predefined semantic patches.

Result: Experiments on three fine-grained classification datasets show competitive performance compared to other popular models, with unique explainability features demonstrated through comprehensive metrics.

Conclusion: ProtoMask successfully improves the truthfulness of prototype-based explanations by leveraging segmentation models to constrain saliency computations to semantic regions, providing more reliable visualizations while maintaining competitive classification performance.

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT enhances Concept Bottleneck Models by integrating structured concept relationships through graph transformers and a Mixture of Experts module, improving interpretability and accuracy in complex concept reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of single-modal CBMs that ignore structured concept relationships, and improve interpretability in deep learning for high-stakes domains.

Method: Constructs answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs, integrates Graph Transformer to capture multi-level dependencies, and replaces feed-forward layers with Mixture of Experts module for dynamic expert selection.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured concept relationships and using dynamic expert allocation.

Conclusion: MoE-SGT successfully overcomes traditional CBM limitations by explicitly modeling concept structures and enhancing reasoning capacity through expert mixture, providing better interpretability and performance.

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

### [116] [Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705)
*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that uses MLLMs' intrinsic uncertainty as guidance to improve fine-grained perception in visual tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception like identifying small objects or key moments, and existing methods rely on complex task-specific fine-tuning that limits generalizability.

Method: Proposes using MLLMs' output entropy as a proactive guidance signal, where decreased entropy indicates relevant visual information. Introduces a unified mechanism to score candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty.

Result: Applied to Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, achieving performance competitive with specialized fine-tuned methods using off-the-shelf MLLMs.

Conclusion: Harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance without additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based motion correction for stress perfusion CMR that replaces slow iterative registration with efficient one-shot estimation, achieving 15x faster processing while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration-based motion correction methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness and scalability of quantitative stress perfusion CMR.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning pipeline that corrects motion in three steps using robust principal component analysis to reduce contrast effects, aligning perfusion series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton density-weighted series).

Result: Significantly improved temporal smoothness (p<0.001), comparable myocardial alignment (Dice 0.92 vs 0.91 baseline), reduced standard deviation in perfusion maps (0.52 vs 0.55 ml/min/g), and 15x faster processing.

Conclusion: The deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and auxiliary images and potentially facilitating broader clinical adoption.

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

*Annemarie Hoffsommer,Helen Schneider,Svetlana Pavlitska,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that emotion prediction from EEG signals can achieve high accuracy (91.57%) using only 12 channels instead of the standard 32, making it suitable for low-cost EEG devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate emotion prediction using low-cost EEG devices with simplified measurement capabilities, overcoming the complexity and resource-intensity of full EEG setups while providing a more direct and unbiased alternative to subjective methods like self-assessment and facial expression analysis.

Method: Used Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data from the DEAP dataset into scaleograms, then trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification using only 12 EEG channels instead of the full 32.

Result: Achieved 91.57% accuracy in predicting 4 emotion quadrants (high/low arousal and valence) with only 12 channels, which is comparable to state-of-the-art results of 96.9% accuracy with 32 channels.

Conclusion: A significant reduction in EEG input channels (from 32 to 12) can yield high emotion prediction accuracy, making low-cost EEG devices viable for practical emotion recognition applications.

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework for Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR) that decomposes the challenging ELQ-to-HQ restoration into two steps: first projecting ELQ images to an intermediate LQ manifold, then using frozen BIR models for final restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Blind Image Restoration methods fail with extreme degradations beyond their training scope, leading to artifacts and detail loss due to the massive domain gap between extremely low-quality and high-quality images.

Method: Decomposes restoration into two stages: learns a projector to map ELQ images to intermediate LQ manifold, then uses frozen off-the-shelf BIR models for final HQ restoration. Uses information theory perspective and Information Bottleneck problem formulation with balanced loss function.

Result: Framework enables stable training, supports Look Forward Once for inference-time refinement, and allows plug-and-play strengthening of existing models without finetuning. Extensive experiments show effectiveness under severe degradation regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition approach effectively addresses extreme blind image restoration challenges by bridging the massive domain gap through intermediate projection, providing theoretical grounding and practical benefits for handling severe compounded degradations.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive testing is crucial in ceramic manufacturing to ensure component quality without damaging them. OCT provides high-resolution internal imaging but requires automated analysis for efficient quality control.

Method: Developed a neural network based on U-Net architecture trained on manually segmented OCT images. Evaluated multiple experimental configurations and applied post-processing techniques for quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Result: Achieved 0.979 Dice Score, outperforming comparable studies. Inference time of 18.98 seconds per volume supports practical viability for detecting inclusions and defects.

Conclusion: The system enables more efficient, reliable, and automated quality control in ceramic manufacturing through accurate defect detection using OCT and deep learning.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MULTI-TAP is a plug-and-play architecture for evaluating image-text alignment that addresses limitations of existing methods by providing human-aligned, efficient multi-objective scoring through lightweight training on frozen LVLM hidden states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-text alignment evaluation lacks comprehensive benchmarks and existing predictors fail to combine human judgment alignment, long-sequence processing, inference efficiency, and multi-objective scoring - crucial for real-world scenarios with multiple valid descriptions.

Method: Proposes MULTI-TAP architecture using a reward head on LVLMs with lightweight ridge regression on frozen hidden states to produce both overall and fine-grained multi-objective scores, applicable across different LVLM architectures.

Result: MULTI-TAP achieves significantly higher performance than existing metrics, performs on par with GPT-4o-based G-VEval with smaller models (7-8B), and outperforms VisionREWARD in both performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and new EYE4ALL dataset.

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP provides a robust, efficient solution for multi-objective image-text alignment evaluation, with new EYE4ALL dataset capturing diverse human preferences including BLV individuals, enabling more accessible AI systems.

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZQBA is a zero-query black-box adversarial attack that uses feature maps from one DNN to create adversarial samples that fool other models, achieving better performance than single-query attacks while maintaining imperceptible perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks require multiple queries or training surrogate models/diffusion models, limiting real-world applicability. There's a need for more practical attacks that don't require extensive queries or model training.

Method: Extracts feature maps from a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and adds them to clean images to create adversarial samples that impair target model classification. This approach transfers adversarial samples across different models and datasets.

Result: ZQBA successfully transfers adversarial samples to different models and across CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets. It outperforms state-of-the-art black-box attacks with single query while maintaining imperceptible perturbations (verified by SSIM and qualitative evaluation).

Conclusion: ZQBA demonstrates effective zero-query adversarial attacks by exploiting DNN representations, highlighting vulnerabilities in real-world DNN deployments while providing a more practical attack method than existing approaches.

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

*Haifei Zhang,Patrick Barry,Eduardo Brandao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware interpretable classifier for Concept Bottleneck Models that uses binary class-level concept prototypes for classification and uncertainty measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs sacrifice predictive performance compared to end-to-end CNNs and lack uncertainty propagation from concept predictions to final labels.

Method: Learns binary class-level concept prototypes and uses distances between predicted concept vectors and prototypes as classification scores and uncertainty measures.

Result: Enhances interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction for uncertain/outlier inputs based on deviation from learned prototypes.

Conclusion: The framework improves both interpretability and robustness in CBMs through uncertainty-aware classification using concept prototypes.

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

### [124] [MetaLogic: Robustness Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models via Logically Equivalent Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00796)
*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaLogic is a novel evaluation framework that detects semantic inconsistencies in text-to-image models by comparing image pairs generated from logically equivalent but grammatically different prompts, revealing significant robustness failures in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic variations, exposing limitations in reasoning and generalization despite improved visual quality.

Method: MetaLogic uses metamorphic testing to generate image pairs from semantically identical but grammatically different prompts, then directly compares these pairs to identify inconsistencies without requiring ground truth images.

Result: Evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art T2I models revealed consistent robustness failures, with Flux.dev showing 59% misalignment rate and DALLE-3 showing 71% misalignment rate across various logical constructs.

Conclusion: MetaLogic provides an efficient, scalable, and ground-truth-free approach that effectively uncovers fine-grained logical inconsistencies overlooked by existing evaluation metrics, making it valuable for model debugging and refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: SF-SPA is an automated framework that uses street-view photos to assess building facade PV potential through computer vision and AI, achieving 6.2% area estimation error and 100 seconds per building processing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building facades represent significant untapped solar energy potential in dense urban areas, but assessing their PV potential is challenging due to complex geometries and semantic components.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, LLM-guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation using computer vision and AI techniques.

Result: Validated on 80 buildings across 4 countries with 6.2% ± 2.8% mean area estimation error compared to expert annotations, processing time of ~100 seconds per building.

Conclusion: The method provides reliable energy yield predictions suitable for regional potential studies, urban energy planning, and building-integrated photovoltaic deployment.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.

*Fan Yang,Zhiyang Chen,Yousong Zhu,Xin Li,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajVLM-Gen is a two-stage framework for physics-aware image-to-video generation that uses trajectory prediction and attention-based refinement to produce physically consistent motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that violates real-world dynamics, creating unrealistic videos.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Vision Language Model predicts coarse-grained motion trajectories consistent with physics, 2) Trajectories guide video generation through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. Built trajectory prediction dataset from video tracking data.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT datasets, achieving FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen successfully generates physically consistent videos by incorporating physics-aware trajectory prediction and refinement, demonstrating improved performance over existing video generation methods.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

### [127] [What You See is What You Ask: Evaluating Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00808)
*Divy Kala,Eshika Khandelwal,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQA is a new benchmark for evaluating audio descriptions (ADs) that addresses the subjectivity in AD generation by testing on longer video segments rather than trimmed clips, focusing on visual appreciation and narrative understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD evaluation methods focus on short trimmed clips and compare against single ground-truth references, but AD writing is inherently subjective. Current approaches are inadequate for capturing the full complexity of AD quality.

Method: Proposed ADQA benchmark that evaluates ADs on few-minute long coherent video segments using visual appreciation (VA) questions about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on plot comprehension.

Result: Analysis of two independent AD tracks revealed significant subjectivity in when/what/how to describe. Current AD generation methods perform far worse than human-authored ADs on the ADQA benchmark.

Conclusion: Working with trimmed clips is inadequate for AD evaluation. ADQA provides a more comprehensive benchmark, and future work should focus on improving AD generation methods to better serve BLV users' needs.

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhraseStereo is the first dataset for phrase-region segmentation in stereo images, created by generating right-view images from single-view PhraseCut data using GenStereo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phrase grounding methods are limited to single-view images and miss the geometric cues available in stereo vision, which could enable more precise and context-aware grounding.

Method: Leveraged GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing PhraseCut dataset, extending phrase grounding annotations to stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks.

Result: Created PhraseStereo dataset with stereo image pairs, aligned segmentation masks, and phrase annotations, enabling research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception.

Conclusion: PhraseStereo lays the foundation for developing models that can reason jointly over semantics and geometry in stereo vision, addressing the gap in multimodal learning for stereo images.

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM introduces a robust Real-ISR framework using next-scale autoregressive modeling that achieves superior visual quality and robustness while maintaining fast inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods using diffusion models face trade-offs between quality and efficiency - diffusion from noise is slow but realistic, while direct mapping is fast but lower quality. Current approaches also suffer from robustness issues and artifacts.

Method: Two-stage training: first train a transformation network to map low-quality images to preliminary scales, then perform end-to-end full-model fine-tuning using next-scale autoregressive modeling based on pre-trained Infinity model.

Result: Achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods with fast inference speed. Demonstrates much higher robustness to input image quality and stronger generalization performance.

Conclusion: NSARM provides an effective Real-ISR solution that balances quality, efficiency, and robustness through comprehensive fine-tuning of autoregressive models.

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

*Julius Ott,Nastassia Vysotskaya,Huawei Sun,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two hierarchical contrastive learning methods (G-HMLC and A-HMLC) that model inter-class relationships and imbalanced distributions across hierarchy levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional classification approaches neglect inherent inter-class relationships at different hierarchy levels, missing important supervisory signals for hierarchical classification tasks.

Method: Two hierarchical contrastive learning methods: G-HMLC using Gaussian Mixture Model and A-HMLC using attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features and model inter-class relationships and imbalanced distributions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by 2 percentage points in accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively models hierarchical relationships and demonstrates strong potential for computer vision applications and beyond, with both quantitative and qualitative validation.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

### [131] [Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00855)
*Kevin Zhang,Kuangzhi Ge,Xiaowei Chi,Renrui Zhang,Shaojun Shi,Zhen Dong,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces World-Language Models (WorldLMs) that repurpose video diffusion models as generative encoders for vision-language tasks, achieving enhanced spatial reasoning and multi-frame capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative world models can replace conventional vision encoders for multimodal understanding, leveraging their motion-consistency priors from video pre-training.

Method: Repurposed a video diffusion model as a generative encoder by performing a single denoising step and using the resulting latents as visual embeddings, creating the Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA) variant.

Result: WorldLMs capture distinct visual embeddings useful for downstream understanding, significantly enhance spatial reasoning, enable single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning, and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance on visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: WorldLMs represent a promising new family of vision-language models that leverage world model priors and show potential for advancing generalist vision learning.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

*Hyun-kyu Ko,Youbin Kim,Jihyeon Park,Dongheok Park,Gyeongjin Kang,Wonjun Cho,Hyung Yi,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GSMamba, a hybrid architecture combining Mamba SSMs with shifted window self-attention for video super-resolution, addressing temporal propagation and spatial dependency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic complexity limitations for long sequences, while traditional RNN-based VSR methods suffer from vanishing gradients, lack of parallelism, and slow inference. Mamba SSMs offer linear-time complexity but struggle with spatial dependencies.

Method: Hybrid architecture with shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation and Mamba-based selective scanning for temporal propagation. Introduces Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM) for alignment-aware feature warping to reduce occlusion artifacts.

Result: The method effectively combines efficient temporal modeling with spatial context awareness, addressing limitations of both pure attention and SSM approaches for video super-resolution.

Conclusion: GSMamba provides an effective solution for VSR by leveraging the complementary strengths of selective SSMs and attention mechanisms, enabling efficient long-range modeling while maintaining spatial detail.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

*Roshan Kenia,Anfei Li,Rishabh Srivastava,Kaveri A. Thakoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hybrid deep learning model called AI-CNet3D integrates cross-attention mechanisms into 3D CNNs for glaucoma diagnosis from OCT volumes, improving feature extraction from hemiretinal regions while reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional practice of condensing 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports loses key structural details needed for accurate glaucoma diagnosis, requiring better methods to preserve 3D information.

Method: Proposed AI-CNet3D model integrates cross-attention into 3D CNN, divides volume along two axes to capture hemiretinal asymmetries, uses Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) for visualization, and applies consistency-based multi-task fine-tuning with Grad-CAMs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics, reduces parameter count by 100-fold compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Conclusion: The AI-CNet3D model effectively enhances glaucoma classification by capturing anatomical asymmetries while being computationally efficient, offering improved performance and interpretability for OCT-based glaucoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study investigates how machine learning practitioners select source datasets for transfer learning in medical imaging, finding choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and various similarity metrics, challenging the traditional "more similar is better" view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current source dataset selection in medical imaging transfer learning relies on researcher intuition rather than systematic principles, which can impact algorithm generalizability and patient outcomes.

Method: Conducted a task-based survey with machine learning practitioners to understand source dataset selection decisions from a human-centered HCI perspective.

Result: Practitioners' choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, computational similarity (data embedding), and perceived visual/semantic similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always aligned.

Conclusion: The study reveals ambiguous terminology in dataset selection and suggests a need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make selection heuristics explicit and usable, providing practical insights for more systematic source selection in transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAL-Net is an automated deep learning pipeline for localizing 50 anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans, achieving clinical-level accuracy comparable to intra-observer variability while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is time-consuming and expertise-dependent, limiting clinical applicability of existing deep learning methods that focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input representations.

Method: Combines coarse alignment, region-of-interest filtering, initial landmark approximation with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieved mean localization error of 3.686 mm on 214 annotated scans, preserving anatomical distances with 2.822 mm error. On FaceScape dataset (700 subjects), achieved 0.41 mm point-wise and 0.38 mm distance-wise errors, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PAL-Net provides a lightweight, scalable solution for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis with potential to support clinical workflows and reduce manual annotation dependency, though performance degrades in regions with poor mesh quality.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning-based solutions for inverse problems when ground-truth training data is expensive or impossible to obtain, particularly in challenging settings with single incomplete observation models.

Method: Introduces equivariant reconstruction networks combined with self-supervised splitting losses, which together provide unbiased estimates of the supervised loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in image inpainting, accelerated MRI, and compressive sensing experiments, especially with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised learning strategy effectively addresses inverse problems without requiring ground-truth data, demonstrating strong performance across multiple applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Vector Panning Feature Alignment (VPFA) for cross-resolution person re-identification, addressing resolution differences between low and high-resolution images through semantic direction modeling in feature space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Varying camera distances cause significant resolution differences in pedestrian images, making it hard to match low-resolution with high-resolution counterparts. Existing methods using super-resolution or joint learning increase complexity and face performance bottlenecks.

Method: Discovers semantic directions implying resolution differences in ReID feature space, then proposes VPFA framework that models resolution-specific feature discrepancy through vector panning alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines while achieving higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness and superiority by leveraging the novel finding of resolution-specific semantic directions in feature space, providing a lightweight and efficient solution for cross-resolution ReID.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR is a novel video super-resolution method that uses an autoregressive one-step diffusion paradigm to efficiently process long videos with up to 58x speed-up over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods face inefficiency and poor scalability when processing long video sequences due to multi-step denoising costs and temporal decomposition artifacts.

Method: Reformulates VSR as autoregressive one-step diffusion by adapting pre-trained DiT into causal structure with rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance, and distilling diffusion process into single step with patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency and up to 58x speed-up over methods like MGLD-VSR. Also introduces new benchmark for long-form video evaluation with semantic-level metrics.

Conclusion: InfVSR enables efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos, pushing the frontier of long-form video super-resolution.

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

TL;DR: JEPA-T is a unified multimodal framework that uses joint-embedding predictive Transformers to encode images and text into discrete tokens, with cross-attention for enhanced fusion and text embedding injection for better alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern T2I generation faces challenges in effectively fusing text with visual tokens in token-centric architectures trained with self-supervision.

Method: Encodes images and captions into discrete visual/textual tokens processed by joint-embedding predictive Transformer, incorporates cross-attention for conditional denoising, injects raw text embeddings before flow matching loss, and performs iterative denoising during inference.

Result: Achieves strong data efficiency and open-vocabulary generalization on ImageNet-1K, consistently outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines.

Conclusion: Late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment provides an effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I generation.

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

*Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastForward enables real-time image localization by creating maps and relocalizing queries in a single feed-forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal preparation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art image localization methods require hours to minutes of mapping time, which limits practicability. This work aims to achieve competitive accuracy much faster.

Method: FastForward represents multiple mapping images as 3D-anchored features and uses them to predict image-to-scene correspondences for query images in a single feed-forward pass, coupled with image retrieval.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains including large-scale outdoor environments.

Conclusion: FastForward provides a practical solution for fast and accurate image localization that works efficiently across different environments.

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play refinement module is proposed to enhance spatial correspondence modeling in autoregressive vision-language models by jointly refining all generated tokens using global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models struggle with spatial nature of visual signals conflicting with sequential dependencies of next-token prediction, leading to suboptimal vision-language modeling results.

Method: A post-pretraining refinement module that operates on all generated tokens simultaneously, leveraging global context and relationships across tokens to mitigate error accumulation in sequential generation.

Result: The method improves generation quality and enhances the model's ability to produce semantically consistent results in vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed refinement module effectively addresses spatial correspondence issues in autoregressive vision-language models, improving performance while maintaining the sequential prediction framework.

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

*Xiao Li,Jiaqi Zhang,Shuxiang Zhang,Tianshui Chen,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework preserves core diffusion characteristics directly in one-hot space, achieving superior performance on classification and text generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fundamentally redefine pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in one-hot space, unlike conventional methods that rely on continuous latent spaces or masking policies.

Method: Uses float-encoded one-hot class data as diffusion input, introduces timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss between model outputs and original one-hot labels, establishing bridge between discriminative and generative learning.

Result: Achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to baseline and exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on image captioning.

Conclusion: ADD framework successfully preserves diffusion characteristics in discrete space and demonstrates measurable gains from each component through extensive ablations.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

### [143] [SoftCFG: Uncertainty-guided Stable Guidance for Visual autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00996)
*Dongli Xu,Aleksei Tiulpin,Matthew B. Blaschko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoftCFG is an uncertainty-guided inference method that addresses guidance diminishing and over-guidance issues in autoregressive image generation models by distributing adaptive perturbations across all tokens with certainty weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in autoregressive models suffers from guidance diminishing (conditional-unconditional gap vanishes during decoding) and over-guidance (strong conditions distort visual coherence), limiting their conditional generation performance.

Method: Proposes SoftCFG with uncertainty-guided adaptive perturbations distributed across all tokens, where each token contributes certainty-weighted guidance. Also introduces Step Normalization to bound cumulative perturbations for stable long-sequence generation. The method is training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: SoftCFG significantly improves image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 256 among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: SoftCFG effectively addresses CFG limitations in AR models through uncertainty-guided adaptive perturbations, providing persistent guidance while maintaining visual coherence, without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM enhances Class Activation Mapping (CAM) by adding natural language descriptions to highlight both spatial regions and semantic attributes that drive model predictions, using vision-language models for better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM methods provide spatial highlighting but lack semantic insight into what visual attributes drive predictions, limiting their interpretability in high-stakes applications.

Method: Combines CAM's spatial localization with CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis to derive channel-level semantic representations, then aggregates them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient visual evidence.

Result: TextCAM produces faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity across ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB datasets.

Conclusion: TextCAM successfully bridges the gap between spatial activation maps and semantic understanding, providing more comprehensive explanations that specify both where models attend and what visual attributes support decisions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA is a data-efficient pipeline for video question answering that compresses each second of video into a single temporally pooled image and aligns large vision language models with lightweight supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video question answering systems with large context windows only handle ~50 seconds of video without significant information loss, which is insufficient for longer video content.

Method: Create 1 fps input using temporal pooling methods (Blend Blur, Weighted Average, Exponential, Ramp pooling) and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with supervised two-turn targets including reasoning and final answer using SFT and DPO on ReasonVQA dataset.

Result: Dramatic performance improvements: F1 score from 0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528. Rationale quality significantly increases. Gains persist across different pooling schemes and show strong robustness.

Conclusion: POVQA effectively enables long video question answering through temporal pooling and lightweight supervision, achieving substantial performance gains while maintaining robustness across different pooling methods.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDoctor is a multi-aspect evaluation framework for text-to-image models that assesses image quality across four dimensions and provides pixel-level flaw heatmaps, outperforming scalar-based reward models by 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches quantify image quality using single scalar values, limiting comprehensive and interpretable feedback. There's a need for more detailed evaluation methods that can provide multi-dimensional assessment and pixel-level guidance.

Method: Built on a vision-language model using "look-think-predict" paradigm: first localizes potential flaws, generates reasoning, then concludes with quantitative scores. Trained through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Demonstrates strong alignment with human preference across multiple datasets. When used as reward model for preference tuning, achieves 10% improvement over scalar-based reward models in generation quality.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor provides comprehensive, interpretable evaluation of text-to-image models across multiple quality dimensions and serves as an effective dense reward model for preference alignment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

### [147] [Towards Adversarial Training under Hyperspectral Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01014)
*Weihua Zhang,Chengze Jiang,Jie Gui,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AT-RA, a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method that enhances robustness against adversarial attacks while preserving spectral semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods have limited scalability and effectiveness against strong attacks.

Method: Proposed AT-RA method that combines adversarial training with data augmentation to increase spectral diversity and ensure spatial smoothness, preserving spectral semantics in hyperspectral images.

Result: AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by 21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50, while increasing benign accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is effective for hyperspectral domains, but requires special consideration for spectral semantics; AT-RA successfully addresses these challenges.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with educational video production due to requirements for disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions. The approach leverages renderable environments controlled via logical commands (code) to better meet these demands.

Method: Three-agent framework: Planner structures lecture content into temporal flows and prepares visual assets; Coder converts instructions into executable Python code with scope-guided auto-fix; Critic uses vision-language models with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity.

Result: Achieves 40% improvement over direct code generation and produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. Evaluated on MMMC benchmark using VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and TeachQuiz metric for knowledge recovery.

Conclusion: Code2Video demonstrates potential as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach for educational video generation, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The

### [149] [Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031)
*Pol Labarbarie,Vincent Itier,William Puech*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization method using diffusion models with secret key mechanism and facial mask constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face anonymization methods lack secure reversibility - diffusion models produce high quality but lack secret key protection, while existing reversible methods have quality issues.

Method: Combine secret key with latent face representations in diffusion model, use facial mask to preserve identity-irrelevant features, employ deterministic forward/backward diffusion process for reversibility.

Result: Produces high-quality anonymized faces that are less visually similar to originals than previous work, while enabling secure recovery with correct secret key.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully addresses the trade-off between security, image quality, and reversibility in face anonymization.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: KeySG is a hierarchical 3D scene graph framework that uses keyframes and multi-modal information to enable efficient reasoning and planning in large environments, outperforming previous methods on semantic richness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph approaches are limited to predefined relationships and face scalability issues with large environments that exceed LLM context windows.

Method: Represents 3D scenes as hierarchical graphs with floors, rooms, objects, and functional elements, augmented with multi-modal information from keyframes. Uses VLM for scene information extraction and hierarchical RAG pipeline for context retrieval.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on most metrics across four benchmarks including 3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval.

Conclusion: KeySG enables more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning while mitigating scalability issues in large scene graphs.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

*Yuxiang Feng,Keyang Zhang,Hassane Ouchouid,Ashwil Kaniamparambil,Ioannis Souflas,Panagiotis Angeloudis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A game-theoretic fusion method called Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement is proposed to improve multi-label understanding of dashcam videos by combining multiple vision-language models, reducing hallucinations and improving reliability in autonomous vehicle pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models are increasingly used in autonomous vehicle stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in safety-critical pipelines, necessitating more robust fusion methods.

Method: The method learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labeled history and converts model reports into agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratios. These are combined with contextual priors and a public reputation state updated via Shapley-based team credit. Three heterogeneous VLMs are fine-tuned with LoRA on 1,000 real-world dashcam clips curated through an automatic annotation pipeline.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 compared to the best single model.

Conclusion: VLM fusion serves as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for autonomous vehicle pipelines, effectively amplifying agreement among reliable models while preserving uniquely correct single-model signals and adapting to drift.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust

Method: Given a single panoramic image, EvoWorld generates future video frames using a video generator with view control, evolves 3D reconstruction with a feedforward transformer, and synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from the evolving 3D memory.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, with evaluation on synthetic outdoor, Habitat indoor, and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: EvoWorld represents a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling by leveraging explicit 3D spatial guidance for video generation.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

*Fei Shen,Weihao Xu,Rui Yan,Dong Zhang,Xiangbo Shu,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMAGEdit is a training-free framework for multi-subject video editing that manipulates appearances of designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, using multimodal conditioning and mask sequences without finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and mask boundary entanglement in videos with multiple subjects, expanding the applicability of video editing.

Method: Uses prompt-guided multimodal alignment and prior-based mask retargeting modules to generate multimodal information and mask sequences, then feeds them into pretrained mask-driven video generation models.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSVBench show IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with strong generalization capability.

Conclusion: IMAGEdit significantly improves video editing performance for any number of subjects and is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

*Nemanja Antonic,Monika Scholz,Aymeric Vellinger,Euphrasie Ramahefarivo,Elio Tuci*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: A method to extract behavioral units from C. elegans recordings without requiring full body visibility, using unsupervised automatic pipeline and validated through simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require clear view of entire worm body, which is problematic in high-density conditions where social context influences behavior.

Method: Unsupervised automatic pipeline to extract behavioral units from single point worm tracking, compared with hand-designed units and validated through agent-based simulation.

Result: Spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge from single point tracking and represent fundamental aspect of behavioral classification.

Conclusion: The method successfully extracts behavioral patterns without full body visibility and avoids predefined assumptions that bias analysis.

Abstract: The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of
biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to
complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several
methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods
extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using
different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require
a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For
example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly
informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single
worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract
behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not
necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the
behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees
the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural
analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are
interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The
effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to
which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the
movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal
locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we
show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural
classification process.

*Boshi Wang,Weijian Xu,Yunsheng Li,Mei Gao,Yujia Xie,Huan Sun,Dongdong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Augmenting language agents with repository memory from commit history to improve code localization for bug fixing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods handle each code localization instance from scratch without leveraging prior repository knowledge, unlike human developers who build long-term memory of codebase functionality and bug-fix associations.

Method: Introduce tools for agents to retrieve from non-parametric memory including recent historical commits, linked issues, and functionality summaries of actively evolving code parts identified via commit patterns.

Result: Significantly improves LocAgent (state-of-the-art localization framework) on both SWE-bench-verified and SWE-bench-live benchmarks.

Conclusion: Repository memory augmentation enables agents to accumulate and leverage past experience for long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating human developer expertise.

Abstract: Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software
engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language
agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the
repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is
typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In
contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as
the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and
their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such
memory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized
resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that
allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent
historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of
actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We
demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a
state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the
more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards
developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for
long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.

*Gregory D. Baker,Scott McCallum,Dirk Pattinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a theoretical foundation for machine learning using p-adic metric spaces to better handle hierarchical data, proving that optimal regression planes in p-adic spaces must pass through actual data points rather than interpolating between them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Euclidean metrics fail to capture the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships in real-world machine learning problems, necessitating metrics that naturally respect hierarchical structure.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces and prove that n-dimensional planes minimizing p-adic distances to data points must pass through at least n+1 points, contrasting with Euclidean regression.

Result: The main theoretical result shows that optimal regression in p-adic spaces inherently selects actual data points rather than interpolating between them, with applications demonstrated in NLP tasks involving hierarchical taxonomies and grammatical morphology.

Conclusion: P-adic metrics may be fundamental for properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning, as they better align with the discrete nature of hierarchical relationships where interpolation often makes less sense than selecting actual observed points.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

*Houjun Liu,Shikhar Murty,Christopher D. Manning,Róbert Csordás*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles is a transformer variant that enables parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams, allowing tokens requiring more computation to form "bubbles" for additional thinking during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for scaling inference-time compute rely on explicit chain-of-thought tokens, which are limited to natural-language verbalization and cannot be applied during pretraining.

Method: Thoughtbubbles learns to fork or delete residual streams during pretraining using only language modeling loss, enabling tokens to form parallel computation bubbles in the middle of the network.

Result: Outperforms standard decoder LMs and non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity, and in zero-shot evaluations like HellaSwag and LAMBADA across 150M to 772M parameter scales.

Conclusion: The implicit nature enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, unifying train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

TL;DR: GDLNN is a graph machine learning architecture that combines a domain-specific language (GDL) with neural networks for graph classification, offering interpretable representations and high accuracy while maintaining low explanation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a graph classification method that generates expressive and interpretable graph representations, allowing direct application of existing model explanation techniques to understand predictions.

Method: GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language (GDL) with neural networks, using a GDL layer to generate interpretable graph representations for classification tasks.

Result: GDLNN achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmarks, outperforming dominant methods like GNNs, and produces high-quality explanations when using existing explanation techniques with low overall cost.

Conclusion: GDLNN provides an effective graph classification approach that balances performance, interpretability, and explanation efficiency, making it a practical alternative to traditional graph learning methods.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a principled framework for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) by unrolling proximal gradient methods, reveals limitations of existing SAEs that enforce non-negativity, and proposes AbsTopK SAE that preserves bidirectional activations for richer semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of principled framework for deriving SAEs from dictionary learning formulation and overcome the limitation where existing SAEs' non-negativity constraints prevent single features from representing bidirectional concepts.

Method: Unrolling proximal gradient method for sparse coding to derive SAE variants, and proposing AbsTopK SAE which applies hard thresholding over largest-magnitude activations to preserve both positive and negative activations.

Result: AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability, enables single features to encode contrasting concepts, and matches or surpasses supervised Difference-in-Mean method across four LLMs and seven tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides principled derivation of SAEs, and AbsTopK variant overcomes fundamental limitations of existing SAEs by enabling bidirectional concept representation through magnitude-based sparsity enforcement.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

*Yen-Shan Chen,Sian-Yao Huang,Cheng-Lin Yang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me is a modular data poisoning attack for RAG systems that uses reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions to efficiently poison documents, achieving 2.6x higher success rates than prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG data poisoning attacks are costly and don't scale well, requiring optimization for each target phrase. There's a need for more efficient and reusable attack methods.

Method: Decomposes adversarial documents into reusable Attention Attractors (optimized to direct attention) and Focus Regions (for inserting semantic baits or malicious instructions). Identifies and steers key attention heads correlated with attack success.

Result: Across 18 RAG settings, raises average attack success rates from 21.9% to 57.8% (+35.9 points, 2.6x improvement). Single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box systems without retraining.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning, showing modular reusable components pose practical threat. Reveals strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

*Maxime Méloux,Maxime Peyrard,François Portet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mechanistic Interpretability methods like circuit discovery should be treated as statistical estimators and evaluated for stability. Analysis of EAP-IG method shows high structural variance and hyperparameter sensitivity, questioning reliability of findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve scientific rigor in Mechanistic Interpretability by treating interpretability methods as statistical estimators and evaluating their stability, variance, and robustness.

Method: Systematic stability analysis of EAP-IG circuit discovery method through controlled perturbations including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, hyperparameter variation, and injected noise in causal analysis.

Result: EAP-IG exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters across diverse models and tasks, questioning the stability of its findings.

Conclusion: Recommend routine reporting of stability metrics to promote more rigorous and statistically grounded interpretability science.

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF) improves downstream tasks but not language modeling on high-quality data, as it implicitly filters the reference dataset. CQF's behavior differs from training on synthetic data of increasing quality, challenging its notion of data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale models are trained on web data of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. CQF is a popular method that uses a classifier to filter pretraining data based on similarity to a high-quality reference set.

Method: Analyze CQF by training binary classifiers to distinguish pretraining data from high-quality sets, assigning quality scores, and comparing with models trained on synthetic data of increasing quality via random token permutations.

Result: CQF improves downstream task performance but does not enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. CQF implicitly filters the high-quality reference set itself. Models trained with CQF show different trends than those trained on synthetic data of increasing quality.

Conclusion: CQF does not capture a meaningful notion of data quality, as evidenced by its paradoxical effects and different behavior compared to training on synthetic quality-controlled data.

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

TL;DR: GRPO can be effectively implemented with just 2 rollouts instead of large groups, achieving similar performance with 70% less training time by reframing it as contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that GRPO requires large group sizes for stable training, which incurs substantial computational overhead.

Method: Reframe GRPO as contrastive learning, revealing connection to DPO, and investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO) with rigorous theoretical analysis.

Result: 2-GRPO achieves performance on par with 16-GRPO using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time by over 70%.

Conclusion: GRPO can be effectively optimized with minimal group sizes, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

TL;DR: GEM is an open-source environment simulator for LLM-based agents, providing standardized interfaces, vectorized execution, and diverse environments to facilitate experience-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training paradigm for LLMs is shifting from static datasets to experience-based learning through environment interaction, requiring standardized tools to accelerate this transition.

Method: GEM provides a standardized framework with asynchronous vectorized execution, flexible wrappers, diverse environments, integrated tools, and compatibility with multiple RL frameworks including REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization.

Result: The paper provides baselines across 24 environments using ReBN, conducts benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in single- and multi-turn settings, and demonstrates GEM's utility as both training environment and evaluation toolkit.

Conclusion: GEM aims to accelerate agentic LLM research by providing a comprehensive framework for experience-based learning, similar to OpenAI-Gym's role in traditional RL.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of multi-turn RL for LLM agents, breaking down design space into environment, reward, and policy pillars, with empirical findings distilled into a training recipe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for training LLM agents via multi-turn RL are fragmented with no systematic analysis of which design choices matter across tasks, creating a gap in understanding effective training approaches.

Method: Empirical analysis across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and SWE-Gym domains, examining three pillars: environment (task complexity), reward (sparsity vs density), and policy (biased/unbiased gradient methods and SFT-RL ratio).

Result: Found that simple environments provide generalization signal; dense rewards accelerate training but require careful RL algorithm selection; optimal SFT-RL ratio exists for fixed budgets; and reward sparsity interacts differently with policy gradient methods.

Conclusion: Developed a training recipe that guides co-design across environment, reward, and policy pillars to facilitate multi-turn agentic RL research and practical applications.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

TL;DR: Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL) is a lightweight RL algorithm that uses a learned value model to select intermediate-difficulty prompts for post-training language models, achieving faster training and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training LLMs via RL is sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, and existing methods often use costly rollouts for filtering prompts.

Method: PCL identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty using a concurrently updated value model, focusing on prompts with high effective ratios in an on-policy manner.

Result: PCL achieves 12.1× and 16.9× faster speed on MATH and DeepScaleR respectively compared to rollout-based methods, while reaching comparable or better performance with less training time.

Conclusion: PCL provides an improved tradeoff between performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused RL by accurately predicting prompt difficulty and progressively focusing on more challenging prompts.

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

### [168] [Simultaneous Multi-objective Alignment Across Verifiable and Non-verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01167)
*Yiran Shen,Yu Xia,Jonathan Chang,Prithviraj Ammanabrolu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for multi-objective alignment of large language models across verifiable rewards, subjective preferences, and interactive scenarios using process reward models and multi-action-head DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a single objective, failing to handle multiple domains simultaneously and providing little user control during inference.

Method: Standardizes process reward model training across verifiable and non-verifiable settings, performs multi-objective alignment using Multi-Action-Head DPO (MAH-DPO) with vectorized rewards, and enables fine-grained inference-time user control.

Result: Experiments show improved performance across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue simultaneously, with minimized cross-objective trade-offs and flexible inference control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully aligns LLMs across multiple objectives while maintaining user control and minimizing trade-offs between different alignment goals.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Toucan is the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset with 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs), enabling diverse and realistic multi-tool interactions for LLM agent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-source community lacks high-quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data, with existing datasets being limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, especially for multi-tool and multi-turn interactions.

Method: The pipeline generates tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies quality filtering, then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks, followed by rigorous rule-based and model-based validation. Three extension mechanisms further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and advance the Pareto frontier on MCP-Universe Bench.

Conclusion: Toucan addresses the critical gap in high-quality tool-agentic training data and enables significant performance improvements for LLM agents through its diverse, realistic, and challenging task trajectories.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BroRL scales RL by increasing rollouts per example instead of training steps, overcoming performance plateaus in ProRL and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ProRL shows diminishing returns when scaling training steps, with performance plateaus after thousands of steps. BroRL explores a complementary approach by broadening exploration through more rollouts per example.

Method: Uses mass balance equation analysis to characterize probability mass changes during RL. Increases number of rollouts per example to hundreds for exhaustive exploration, ensuring correct-mass expansion as unsampled terms diminish with more rollouts.

Result: BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps, shows continuous improvement, and achieves state-of-the-art results for 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Increasing rollouts per example provides an effective complementary scaling paradigm to training steps, overcoming saturation and enabling continuous performance gains in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

*Emerald Zhang,Julian Weaver,Samantha R Santacruz,Edward Castillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVO-LRP uses evolutionary optimization to tune LRP hyperparameters for better interpretability metrics and visual coherence in XAI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LRP implementations use heuristic rules that aren't optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior, creating a need for principled optimization of attribution methods.

Method: EVO-LRP applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to optimize LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative interpretability metrics like faithfulness and sparseness.

Result: EVO-LRP outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metrics and visual coherence, showing strong sensitivity to class-specific features.

Conclusion: Attribution quality in XAI can be systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization rather than relying on heuristic rules.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

*Debottam Dutta,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes EVaLP, an energy-based variational latent prior for VAEs that addresses the prior hole problem by modeling the prior as an energy-based model with a variational approach to bypass expensive MCMC sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAEs generate blurry samples due to the 'prior hole' problem - regions with high prior probability but low posterior probability, leading to poor quality data generation.

Method: Model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM) with a variational approach to handle the normalization constant, using a sampler network for approximation and formulating training as an alternating optimization problem.

Result: EVaLP shows improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior holes, and better sampling efficiency compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed energy-based variational latent prior effectively addresses the prior hole problem in VAEs while maintaining efficient sampling capabilities.

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

*Suhyeon Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop is a plug-and-play RL framework that uses step-wise prompt refinement through a multimodal LLM to align diffusion models without modifying their weights, achieving better generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based fine-tuning of diffusion models struggles with generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking. Prompt refinement approaches often use a single refined prompt throughout sampling, failing to leverage the sequential nature of RL.

Method: Train a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with RL to iteratively update prompts based on intermediate latent states of diffusion models, creating step-wise prompt refinement without modifying diffusion model weights.

Result: PromptLoop achieves effective reward optimization, generalizes seamlessly to unseen models, composes orthogonally with existing alignment methods, and mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: PromptLoop provides a flexible and generalizable approach for diffusion model alignment through step-wise prompt refinement, offering advantages over traditional RL fine-tuning while maintaining compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADA is a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation method that adjusts augmentation strengths based on each sample's evolving influence on model optimization, improving training effectiveness by matching augmentation intensity to sample difficulty dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed or random data augmentation methods don't account for how sample difficulty evolves with model generalization capabilities, leading to mismatch between augmented data and model's training needs.

Method: Estimates sample influence by projecting gradient onto accumulated model update direction and computing temporal variance. Low-variance samples get stronger augmentation for diversity, unstable samples get milder transformations for semantic fidelity.

Result: Consistent improvements across benchmark datasets: +7.3% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3% on long-tailed datasets.

Conclusion: SADA is an effective, lightweight plug-and-play method that dynamically adapts augmentation to sample influence, enhancing training effectiveness without requiring auxiliary models or policy tuning.

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a rehearsal-free and task-free online continual learning (F2OCL) method that addresses catastrophic forgetting without storing samples or using task boundaries/identities, by integrating prompt learning with an NCM classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online continual learning approaches either use rehearsal buffers (raising privacy/security concerns) or rely on task boundaries (not always available in one-pass data processing), motivating a rehearsal-free and task-free solution.

Method: The proposed method integrates prompt learning with an NCM (Nearest Class Mean) classifier to tackle catastrophic forgetting without storing samples or using task boundaries/identities.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed F2OCL method in addressing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning without requiring sample storage or task boundary information, providing a practical solution for scenarios with privacy concerns and continuous data streams.

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI) to diagnose shortcut feature exploitation in continual learning, showing that CL methods can be misled by spurious features like color patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks exploit shortcut features that undermine robustness. In continual learning, this can cause persistent bias from earlier tasks, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect where past habits block optimal solutions.

Method: Proposed ERI diagnostic with three facets: Adaptation Delay (AD), Performance Deficit (PD), and Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). Evaluated on CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with spurious magenta patch in Phase 2, testing methods like SGD, EWC_on, DER++, GPM, and DGR.

Result: CL methods reached accuracy thresholds earlier than Scratch-T2 baseline (negative AD) but achieved slightly lower final accuracy on patched classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improved CL methods' accuracy while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel.

Conclusion: The spurious patch acted as a distractor rather than helpful shortcut for CL models, demonstrating the ERI's ability to detect shortcut-induced rigidity in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

TL;DR: EditTrack is a framework for detecting if a suspicious image was edited from a specific base image using AI models, and identifying which editing model was used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only detect if an image is AI-generated/edited, but cannot determine if it was specifically edited from a particular base image or identify the editing model used.

Method: Proposes EditTrack framework with novel re-editing strategy and carefully designed similarity metrics based on four key observations about the editing process.

Result: Evaluated on five editing models across six datasets, EditTrack consistently achieves accurate detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.

Conclusion: EditTrack successfully bridges the gap in image-editing detection and attribution, providing the first solution to determine if an image was edited from a specific base image and identify the editing model responsible.

Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection
and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to
determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an
AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing
model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated
images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether
an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a
particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first
framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on
four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel
re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to
determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so,
by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models
across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate
detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.

Motivation: High demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and film making, with existing models struggling with object-level operations across both audio and visual modalities while preserving structural information.

Method: Inversion-regeneration paradigm with word-to-sounding-object aligned audio generation model and holistically-optimized editing algorithm for better structural preservation and object-level control.

Result: Achieved advanced results in audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic alignment, and the audio generation model also showed advanced performance.

Conclusion: Object-AVEdit successfully addresses object-level audio-visual editing challenges through its novel approach, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining structural information and achieving semantic alignment.

Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and
the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video
editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically,
object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object
addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities,
while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the
editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving
the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration
paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we
develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging
the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation
models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation
and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration
holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention
during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both
audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic
alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved
advanced performance. More results on our project page:

TL;DR: SelfOrg is a framework for multi-agent LLM systems that dynamically adapts communication using Shapley value-based peer assessment and DAG structures, enabling self-organization without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent LLM systems use fixed communication topologies or complex external judges, limiting collaboration efficiency and adaptability to different tasks and agent capabilities.

Method: Agents independently respond to queries and assess peer contributions using Shapley value approximation. A DAG regulates response propagation, dynamically updated based on previous collaboration rounds to ensure efficient message transmission from high-contributing agents.

Result: Experiments show robust performance with significant gains in weak LLM regimes where prior methods fail. The framework demonstrates that multiple agents increase correctness probability and correct responses naturally dominate information flow.

Conclusion: SelfOrg enables effective self-organization in multi-agent LLM systems through dynamic communication adaptation, outperforming fixed-topology approaches especially with weaker models, without requiring additional supervision or training.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the
potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However,
this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between
agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure
between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches
rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,
or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,
we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication
on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and
assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of
the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message
transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically
updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.
Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without
additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg
framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account
the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak
LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak
regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple
agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses
naturally dominate the information flow.

TL;DR: VLA-RFT introduces a reinforcement fine-tuning framework using data-driven world models as controllable simulators to enhance VLA models' robustness and efficiency with minimal fine-tuning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models suffer from compounding errors and poor robustness due to heavy reliance on imitation learning, while RL approaches face high real-world interaction costs or sim-to-real gaps.

Method: Leverages a data-driven world model trained from real interaction data to predict future visual observations conditioned on actions, enabling policy rollouts with dense trajectory-level rewards from goal-achieving references.

Result: Achieves superior performance over supervised baselines with fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, demonstrates greater efficiency than simulator-based RL, and maintains strong robustness under perturbed conditions.

Conclusion: World-model-based reinforcement fine-tuning is established as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance VLA models' generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed

### [181] [Hybrid Training for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00600)
*Pietro Mazzaglia,Cansu Sancaktar,Markus Peschl,Daniel Dijkman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid Training (HyT) enables Vision-Language-Action models to benefit from Chain-of-Thought reasoning during training while allowing direct action prediction during inference, improving performance without increasing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought strategies improve performance but increase inference time, which is problematic for real-time robotic applications requiring fast action sequences.

Method: Hybrid Training framework that trains VLAs to learn from thoughts during training while enabling direct action prediction without CoT generation during inference, supporting conditional output prediction.

Result: The method was evaluated in simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments, showing performance improvements without the inference time penalty of CoT generation.

Conclusion: HyT provides a flexible framework that maintains performance benefits of CoT reasoning while enabling efficient inference, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

### [182] [HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695)
*Myungkyu Koo,Daewon Choi,Taeyoung Kim,Kyungmin Lee,Changyeon Kim,Youngyo Seo,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HAMLET is a framework that adapts Vision-Language-Action models to incorporate historical context using moment tokens and a lightweight memory module, achieving significant performance improvements on history-dependent robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation tasks are inherently history-dependent, but most existing VLAs ignore preceding context and rely only on current observations, limiting their performance on tasks requiring historical understanding.

Method: Introduces moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep, initialized with time-contrastive learning. Uses a lightweight memory module to integrate moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features for action prediction.

Result: HAMLET achieves 76.4% success rate on history-dependent real-world tasks (47.2% improvement over baseline), improves RoboCasa Kitchen performance from 64.1% to 66.4%, and LIBERO performance from 95.6% to 97.7%.

Conclusion: HAMLET effectively transforms state-of-the-art VLAs into history-aware policies, demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context, even under generic robot-manipulation benchmarks.

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning language models suffer from computational inefficiencies due to overthinking, and existing methods struggle to balance reasoning quality with inference cost reduction.

Method: ARS uses a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism with progressive suppression thresholds to dynamically suppress redundant reasoning steps without requiring additional training.

Result: ARS achieves up to 53% token reduction, 46.1% latency reduction, and 57.9% energy reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks with multiple model architectures.

Conclusion: ARS provides an effective training-free solution for improving computational efficiency in large reasoning language models while preserving reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,

*Sarvesh Soni,Dina Demner-Fushman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Automated evaluation of AI responses to patient health questions can effectively replace labor-intensive human expert review, with automated rankings closely matching expert ratings when using clinician-authored reference answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gold standard for evaluating AI health responses (human expert review) is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated metrics are promising but variably aligned with human judgments.

Method: Conducted large systematic study across 100 patient cases with responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total), assessed along three dimensions: answering the question, appropriate use of clinical note evidence, and use of general medical knowledge. Used clinician-authored reference answers to anchor automated metrics.

Result: Automated rankings closely matched expert ratings, demonstrating that carefully designed automated evaluation can effectively assess AI system responses.

Conclusion: Carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication, providing a feasible alternative to labor-intensive human expert review.

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

### [185] [ACON: Optimizing Context Compression for Long-horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00615)
*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON is a framework that compresses agent context (observations and histories) using LLM-guided optimization to reduce memory usage while maintaining task performance in long-horizon environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of growing context length in agentic tasks, which increases costs and reduces efficiency, as existing context compression methods focus mainly on single-step tasks.

Method: Uses compression guideline optimization in natural language space: analyzes failure cases from paired trajectories, updates compression guidelines, and distills optimized compressors into smaller models.

Result: Reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while preserving task performance, maintains over 95% accuracy when distilled, and improves smaller LMs' performance by up to 46% as long-horizon agents.

Conclusion: ACON provides an effective framework for context compression in agentic tasks, enabling efficient long-horizon reasoning with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

### [186] [HARPA: A Testability-Driven, Literature-Grounded Framework for Research Ideation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00620)
*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA is an AI system that generates testable, literature-grounded scientific hypotheses by mimicking human researcher workflows, achieving significant improvements in feasibility and groundedness compared to baseline AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated scientific discovery tools struggle to generate testable hypotheses grounded in scientific literature and lack adaptability to prior experimental outcomes.

Method: HARPA uses a three-step workflow: 1) literature mining to identify research trends, 2) exploring hypothesis design spaces, and 3) converging on precise hypotheses by identifying research gaps and justifying design choices. It also learns a reward model from experimental outcomes.

Result: HARPA outperforms baseline AI in feasibility (+0.78) and groundedness (+0.85) on 10-point scale. With CodeScientist agent, it achieved more successful executions (20 vs 11) and fewer failures (16 vs 21). The reward model achieved ~28% absolute gain over untrained baseline.

Conclusion: HARPA represents significant progress in AI-driven scientific discovery by generating more feasible and grounded hypotheses that better translate to successful experimental execution.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Expected Attention is a training-free KV cache compression method that estimates KV pair importance by predicting future query attention, overcoming limitations of traditional attention-score-based pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory consumption of KV cache is a major bottleneck for efficient LLM inference, and existing attention-score-based pruning methods face practical limitations due to unavailability of future attention scores and modern implementations like Flash Attention not materializing full attention matrices.

Method: Uses distributional properties of LLM activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair, enabling principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with minimal impact on the residual stream.

Result: Achieves effective compression without performance degradation, operates seamlessly across both prefilling and decoding phases, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution to KV cache compression challenges and the authors release KVPress, a comprehensive library with over 20 techniques for researchers to implement and benchmark KV cache compression methods.

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

TL;DR: SMDS is a model-agnostic method that automatically discovers feature manifolds in language models, revealing various geometric structures like circles, lines, and clusters that support reasoning and dynamically reshape with context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods focus on specific geometries for specific features and lack generalization, while the linear representation hypothesis suggests language models encode concepts as organized multidimensional manifolds.

Method: Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS) - a model-agnostic method to automatically discover feature manifolds, applied to temporal reasoning as a case study.

Result: Different features form various geometric structures (circles, lines, clusters) that consistently reflect concept properties, are stable across models, support reasoning, and dynamically reshape with context changes.

Conclusion: Feature manifolds play a functional role in entity-based reasoning, supporting that language models encode and transform structured representations through organized geometric structures.

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

TL;DR: VIRTUE is a visual-interactive embedding model that extends segmentation models and VLMs to enable region-specific representation learning, achieving SOTA performance on universal and visual-interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest, limiting their human-interactive applicability and ability to learn entity-level information within images.

Method: Extends segmentation models and vision-language models to process visual prompts (point, bounding box, mask) that pinpoint specific regions, enabling precise handling of complex scenarios.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB tasks (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR tasks (15.2%-20.3%).

Conclusion: VIRTUE successfully bridges the gap between generative models' visual-interactive capabilities and embedding models, unlocking new applications with localized grounding of user intent.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Activation-Deactivation (AD) paradigm and ConvAD mechanism for more robust black-box explanations of CNN image classifiers by deactivating model parts instead of occluding input features, eliminating out-of-distribution issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box explainability methods rely on occluding input parts, creating out-of-distribution images and requiring domain knowledge for occlusion value selection, raising doubts about explanation quality.

Method: Proposes Activation-Deactivation (AD) paradigm that removes effects of occluded features by switching off corresponding model parts. Introduces ConvAD as a drop-in mechanism for CNNs that implements AD without additional training.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows AD explanations achieve up to 62.5% improvement in robustness compared to occlusion-based methods, with consistent improvements across datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: ConvAD provides more robust explanations without requiring domain knowledge or additional training, and preserves the original decision-making process of the network.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

TL;DR: A method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening between two characters using Cross-Space In-Betweening and techniques to maintain interaction quality and motion quality over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion in-betweening research focused on single characters, but extending to densely interacting characters is challenging due to the need for precise spatial-temporal correspondence while creating natural transitions between keyposes.

Method: Proposes Cross-Space In-Betweening that models interactions across different conditioning representation spaces. Uses adversarial learning to identify periodic interaction patterns and learns to refine drifted latent space to prevent pose error accumulation for long-horizon synthesis.

Result: The approach produces realistic, controllable, and long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and dancing actions across multiple keyposes, validated by quantitative evaluations and user studies.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables natural interaction between two characters in motion in-betweening while maintaining motion quality and interaction over long horizons.

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is the problem to synthesize movement between keyposes.
Traditional research focused primarily on single characters. Extending them to
densely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise
spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the
interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In
this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening
that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To
effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution
called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each
character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further
observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters
heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and
diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present
two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby
keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain
interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through
adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to
refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We
demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and
long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and
dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative
evaluations and user studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sliced Wasserstein Distance offers a scalable alternative to Wasserstein distance for high-dimensional distributions, but its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance, leading to noisy gradients and slow convergence.

Method: Reservoir SWD (ReSWD) integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively retain informative projection directions during optimization steps, resulting in stable gradients while remaining unbiased.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks (color correction, diffusion guidance) show ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction baselines.

Conclusion: ReSWD provides an effective variance reduction method for SWD that maintains unbiasedness and improves performance across various vision and graphics applications.

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the
widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional
distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable
alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,
resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable natural social interactions in virtual reality through real-time facial animation that captures the full spectrum of human expressions for anyone.

Method: Encoder transforms audio to latent facial expressions, decoded via diffusion models. Uses online transformer (no future input dependency) and distillation pipeline (single-step denoising) for real-time performance.

Result: Achieves 100-1000x faster inference than offline SOTA, maintains animation quality in continuous frame-by-frame processing, validated in live VR demos and multilingual scenarios.

Conclusion: System successfully enables real-time photorealistic facial animation for VR social interactions with minimal latency and high accuracy.

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D
facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in
virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that
transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,
which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the
generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of
facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving
real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes
latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates
dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates
iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design
challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals
frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility
of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic
modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted
eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.
We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various
scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Method: The authors propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space. They also introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning to enable conversational capabilities.

Result: The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks.

Conclusion: This approach offers valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models by enabling effective cross-modal representation learning and conversational capabilities in EEG interpretation.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However,
the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG
signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural
states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective
cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover
complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,
we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a
unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable
conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the
first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model
demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,
open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering
valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of
general-purpose EEG models.

### [196] [QSearchNet: A Quantum Walk Search Framework for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00325)
*Priyank Dubey*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QSearchNet is a quantum-inspired framework using Discrete-Time Quantum Walk and Grover's amplification for link prediction in graphs, achieving competitive performance on real-world networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical link prediction heuristics struggle to optimally integrate local and global structural information or adapt to complex dependencies in graphs, while quantum computing offers advantages through superposition and interference.

Method: Uses Discrete-Time Quantum Walk dynamics and Grover's amplitude amplification to simulate topology-aware quantum evolution, propagating amplitudes across nodes simultaneously and aligning interference patterns through quantum reflection and phase-flip operations.

Result: Experiments on diverse real-world networks show competitive performance, particularly with hard negative samples under realistic evaluation conditions.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired approaches like QSearchNet can effectively handle complex graph dependencies and improve link prediction performance by leveraging quantum superposition and interference mechanisms.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in graph theory, critical
for understanding and forecasting the evolution of complex systems like social
and biological networks. While classical heuristics capture certain aspects of
graph topology, they often struggle to optimally integrate local and global
structural information or adapt to complex dependencies. Quantum computing
offers a powerful alternative by leveraging superposition for simultaneous
multi-path exploration and interference-driven integration of both local and
global graph features. In this work, we introduce QSearchNet, a
quantum-inspired framework based on Discrete-Time Quantum Walk (DTQW) dynamics
and Grover's amplitude amplification. QSearchNet simulates a topology-aware
quantum evolution to propagate amplitudes across multiple nodes simultaneously.
By aligning interference patterns through quantum reflection and oracle-like
phase-flip operation, it adaptively prioritizes multi-hop dependencies and
amplifies structurally relevant paths corresponding to potential connections.
Experiments on diverse real-world networks demonstrate competitive performance,
particularly with hard negative samples under realistic evaluation conditions.

### [197] [Spiralformer: Low Latency Encoder for Streaming Speech Recognition with Circular Layer Skipping and Early Exiting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00982)
*Emiru Tsunoo,Hayato Futami,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Spiralformer reduces encoding latency in streaming speech recognition by using small chunk shifts with cyclic layer dropping and early exiting, achieving 21.6% lower emission delay in Librispeech and 7.0% in CSJ with similar computational cost and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many studies focus on improving emission latency of transducers, little work has addressed encoding latency in block processing for streaming speech recognition. The goal is to reduce latency by emitting smaller chunks more frequently rather than larger chunks less often.

Method: Proposed Spiralformer encoder that combines layer dropping and early exiting for block processing. It skips layer computation cyclically and shifts computed layers spirally across blocks, completing all layer computations over the block processing cycle.

Result: Achieved 21.6% reduction in averaged token emission delay on Librispeech and 7.0% on CSJ, while maintaining similar computational cost and word error rates compared to baseline.

Conclusion: Spiralformer effectively reduces encoding latency in streaming speech recognition through efficient layer computation management, enabling more frequent small-chunk emissions without increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: For streaming speech recognition, a Transformer-based encoder has been widely
used with block processing. Although many studies addressed improving emission
latency of transducers, little work has been explored for improving encoding
latency of the block processing. We seek to reduce latency by frequently
emitting a chunk with a small shift rather than scarce large-chunk emissions,
resulting in higher computational costs. To efficiently compute with the small
chunk shift, we propose a new encoder, Spiralformer, tailored for block
processing by combining layer dropping and early exiting. We skip layer
computation in a cyclic manner and shift the computed layer in each block
spirally, which completes computation for all the layers over the block
processing. Experimentally, we observed that our method achieved 21.6%
reduction in the averaged token emission delay in Librispeech, and 7.0% in CSJ,
compared with the baseline with similar computational cost and word error
rates.

*Nima Sheikholeslami,Erfan Hosseini,Patrice Bechard,Srivatsava Daruru,Sai Rajeswar*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MW loss as a superior alternative to Contrastive Loss for dual-encoder retrievers, directly optimizing AUC to improve ranking quality and calibration for applications like RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective used in Contrastive Loss is fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC, leading to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks like retrieval-augmented generation.

Method: Proposes MW loss that maximizes the Mann-Whitney U statistic (mathematically equivalent to AUC), encouraging correct ranking of positive-negative pairs by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences.

Result: Retrievers trained with MW loss consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval metrics, yielding better-calibrated and more discriminative retrievers.

Conclusion: MW loss is an empirically superior alternative to Contrastive Loss that directly aligns optimization with retrieval goals through AUC maximization, particularly beneficial for high-stakes applications like RAG.

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents
should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,
optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is
fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This
mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental
limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes
the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area
under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be
correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We
provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,
better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC
curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever
calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss
consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval
metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior
alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more
discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

*Thong Nguyen,Yibin Lei,Jia-Huei Ju,Eugene Yang,Andrew Yates*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MILCO is a multilingual learned sparse retrieval architecture that maps queries/documents into shared English lexical space using a multilingual connector and LexEcho head, achieving SOTA performance with dynamic efficiency through pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learned sparse retrieval approaches struggle to scale beyond English, and uncommon entities are often lost when projected into English.

Method: Two-stage training combining Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training, plus LexEcho head that augments English lexical representation with source-language view via [ECHO] token.

Result: Achieves SOTA multilingual/cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming BGE-M3 and Qwen3-Embed on benchmarks. With 30 active dimensions, MILCO 560M beats Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

Conclusion: MILCO provides effective multilingual sparse retrieval with representation transparency and dynamic efficiency through pruning.

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with
the transparency of lexical matching, but existing approaches struggle to scale
beyond English. We introduce MILCO, an LSR architecture that maps queries and
documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a
multilingual connector. MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime
that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide
representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic
collapse. Motivated by the observation that uncommon entities are often lost
when projected into English, we propose a new LexEcho head, which enhances
robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a
source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token. MILCO achieves
state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming
leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and
Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic
efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to
reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO
560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

*Roksana Goworek,Olivia Macmillan-Scott,Eda B. Özyiğit*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR), tracing developments from early translation-based methods to modern embedding-driven and generative techniques using multilingual LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of retrieving relevant documents in languages different from the query language, and to provide a structured account of CLIR components, evaluation practices, and resources while identifying persistent challenges.

Method: The paper presents a structured survey approach, analyzing core CLIR components, evaluation practices, and available resources. It traces the evolution from translation-based methods to embedding-based approaches and multilingual LLMs.

Result: The survey identifies that recent advances have shifted from translation-based methods to embedding-based approaches and multilingual LLMs, offering improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation.

Conclusion: The work reviews current CLIR capabilities and outlines future directions for building robust, inclusive, and adaptable retrieval systems, while identifying persistent challenges like data imbalance and linguistic variation.

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of
retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the
original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as
monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and
cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual
retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking
and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted
from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage
multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations
across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual
embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering
improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based
methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It
presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,
and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and
linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested
for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By
situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and
multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current
capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems
that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

### [201] [IA aplicada al análisis del conflicto Irán-Israel: Mapeo de discursos en YouTube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00021)
*Alvaro Vallejo Ramírez*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study analyzes 120,000 YouTube comments about the Iran-Israel conflict using NLP and machine learning to identify discursive positions and examine media/algorithmic biases in digital conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how digital platforms represent international conflicts, identify narrative biases, and examine how media and algorithmic factors shape public discourse about geopolitical events.

Method: Mixed-methods design with triangulation: quantitative phase used BERT and XLM-RoBERTa models to classify comments into 10 categories; qualitative phase involved critical analysis of media context, ideological narratives, manual annotation, and supervised training.

Result: Found overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and anti-US/Israel discourses, with pro-US and anti-Palestinian positions being marginal. Iran emerged as central actor in digital conversations, suggesting narrative shift from previous media frameworks. Algorithmic biases amplified certain discourses while limiting others.

Conclusion: The study provides a replicable framework combining computational analysis and philosophical critique for studying digital controversies. It reveals significant narrative asymmetries in digital conflict representation and demonstrates the influence of algorithmic biases in shaping geopolitical discourse on platforms like YouTube.

Abstract: Purpose. This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel
conflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on
YouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors
involved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital
conversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was
adopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and
machine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments
into ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media
context and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual
annotation and supervised training. This strategy enabled the integration of
statistical robustness with contextual understanding. Results and conclusions.
The findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and
anti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and
anti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in
global media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the
conflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks.
Likewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying
certain discourses while limiting others. Original contributions. This work
combines computational analysis and philosophical critique for the study of
digital controversies, providing a methodological framework replicable in
geopolitical contexts. It is one of the first Spanish-language studies to map,
through artificial intelligence and critical analysis, discourses on an
international conflict on YouTube, highlighting asymmetries and narrative
disputes that are often overlooked.

### [202] [Unpacking Musical Symbolism in Online Communities: Content-Based and Network-Centric Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00006)
*Kajwan Ziaoddini*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Analysis of 275 chart-topping songs shows a decade-long decline in energy and rise in danceability, with lyric analysis revealing pronoun-centric narratives and genre-specific mood patterns, suggesting mainstreaming of peripheral musical codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in online communities by examining the relationship between sonic attributes and lyrical content in popular music.

Method: Combined content-based music analysis (audio descriptors: energy, danceability, loudness, etc.) with network analysis of lyrics using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping songs, building a reproducible pipeline for temporal trend analysis, lexical modeling, and genre profiling.

Result: Found energy declined (79→58) while danceability rose (59→73); valence peaked in 2013 (63) and dipped in 2014-2016 (42); strong correlation between energy and loudness (r=0.74); lyric analysis revealed pronoun-centric lexicon and genre-specific mood patterns (R&B highest valence at 96, Latin/Reggaeton lowest at 37).

Conclusion: Patterns suggest mainstreaming of previously peripheral musical codes and commercial preference for relaxed yet rhythmically engaging productions. Methodologically contributed an integrated MIR-plus-network workflow suitable for socially aware recommendation systems.

Abstract: This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in
online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight
network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping
songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness,
liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric
transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal
trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and
(iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 ->
58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -> 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and
dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows
strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations
for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51);
danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| < 0.20). Lyric
tokenization (>114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and
a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors
mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&B exhibits the
highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70),
whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a
subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of
previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet
rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without
maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated
MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure,
lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to
modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or
community-level diffusion studies.

*Chen-An Li,Tzu-Han Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: LALMs suffer from cross-modal interference where irrelevant audio inputs degrade text reasoning performance, with silence being as disruptive as noise, and current mitigation strategies are limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of large audio-language models in noisy real-world settings and understand how irrelevant audio affects text reasoning tasks where audio is unnecessary.

Method: Evaluated LALMs across three text-based benchmarks with various irrelevant audio inputs (silence, synthetic noise, environmental sounds), analyzed interference patterns based on duration, amplitude, and decoding temperature, and tested mitigation strategies like prompting and self-consistency.

Result: Non-informative audio reduces accuracy and increases prediction volatility; silence destabilizes outputs as strongly as synthetic noise; larger models show greater resilience but vulnerabilities persist; prompting has limited effectiveness while self-consistency improves stability at computational cost.

Conclusion: Cross-modal interference is a key robustness challenge for LALMs, highlighting the need for efficient fusion strategies that preserve reasoning performance with irrelevant inputs.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) unify speech and text processing, but
their robustness in noisy real-world settings remains underexplored. We
investigate how irrelevant audio, such as silence, synthetic noise, and
environmental sounds, affects text reasoning tasks where audio is unnecessary.
Across three text-based benchmarks, we find that even non-informative audio
reduces accuracy and increases prediction volatility; the severity of
interference scales with longer durations, higher amplitudes, and elevated
decoding temperatures. Silence, often assumed neutral, destabilizes outputs as
strongly as synthetic noise. While larger models show greater resilience,
vulnerabilities persist across all evaluated systems. We further test
mitigation strategies and find that prompting shows limited effectiveness,
whereas self-consistency improves stability at the cost of increased
computation. Our results reveal cross-modal interference as a key robustness
challenge and highlight the need for efficient fusion strategies that preserve
reasoning performance in the presence of irrelevant inputs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Large audio-language models exhibit significant selection bias based on answer option ordering, with performance fluctuations up to 24% when options are shuffled, undermining evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LALMs' predictions are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate selection bias and undermine their reliability.

Method: Extensive experiments on six LALMs across three benchmarks and their spoken counterparts, testing performance with shuffled answer options and evaluating permutation-based mitigation strategies.

Result: No model is immune to this bias; shuffling answer options causes performance fluctuations up to 24% and can change model rankings, raising concerns about current evaluation practices.

Conclusion: Permutation-based strategies can mitigate bias in most cases. This represents the first systematic investigation of selection bias in LALMs, highlighting the need for awareness and further research in this area.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) are often used in tasks that involve
reasoning over ordered options. An open question is whether their predictions
are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate a form of
selection bias and undermine their reliability. In this paper, we identify and
analyze this problem in LALMs. We demonstrate that no model is immune to this
bias through extensive experiments on six LALMs across three widely used
benchmarks and their spoken counterparts. Shuffling the order of answer options
can cause performance fluctuations of up to 24% and even change model rankings,
raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation practices. We also
study permutation-based strategies and show that they can mitigate bias in most
cases. Our work represents the first systematic investigation of this issue in
LALMs, and we hope it raises awareness and motivates further research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MOS-RMBench is a unified benchmark that reformulates MOS datasets into preference comparisons to enable rigorous evaluation of speech quality assessment models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech quality assessment relies on human subjective ratings like MOS, which suffer from inconsistent standards and poor reproducibility, creating a need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.

Method: Systematically constructed and evaluated three reward modeling paradigms: scalar reward models, semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs), with a proposed MOS-aware GRM that incorporates MOS-difference-based reward scaling.

Result: Scalar models achieved strongest performance (>74% accuracy), all models performed worse on synthetic vs human speech, and struggled with small MOS differences. MOS-aware GRM improved fine-grained discrimination and narrowed performance gap on challenging cases.

Conclusion: This work establishes both a benchmark and methodological framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech quality assessment.

Abstract: Assessing the perceptual quality of synthetic speech is crucial for guiding
the development and refinement of speech generation models. However, it has
traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score
(MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent
rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we
introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS
datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation
across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct
and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models,
semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments
reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall
performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform
considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models
struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on
these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an
MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale
rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results
show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality
discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging
cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological
framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech
quality assessment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware deep learning model with rejection mechanism for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, showing trade-offs between prediction coverage and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis create uncertainty in clinical settings without confidence indications, posing significant risk for treatment decisions.

Method: Uses uncertainty-aware deep learning models with rejection mechanism to reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making in clinical practice. Evaluated using Variational Bayesian model and metrics like accuracy on accepted predictions, coverage, rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error.

Result: The Variational Bayesian model adopted conservative strategy rejecting uncertain predictions. Shows trade-off between prediction coverage and coverage reliability, and between accuracy and caution.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation and selective rejection improve model reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases for diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual impairment, and
effective treatment options depend heavily on timely and accurate diagnosis.
Deep learning models have demonstrated great success identifying DR from
retinal images. However, relying only on predictions made by models, without
any indication of model confidence, creates uncertainty and poses significant
risk in clinical settings. This paper investigates an alternative in
uncertainty-aware deep learning models, including a rejection mechanism to
reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making
in clinical practice. The results show there is a trade-off between prediction
coverage and coverage reliability. The Variational Bayesian model adopted a
more conservative strategy when predicting DR, subsequently rejecting the
uncertain predictions. The model is evaluated by means of important performance
metrics such as Accuracy on accepted predictions, the proportion of accepted
cases (coverage), the rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
The findings also demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and caution,
establishing that the use of uncertainty estimation and selective rejection
improves the model's reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease is critical, especially for distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment which shows subtle structural changes.

Method: Uses gray and white matter MRI slices as inputs to three pretrained CNNs (ResNet50, NASNet, MobileNet) fine-tuned end-to-end, with stacked ensemble learning and weighted averaging to combine models.

Result: Achieves 99.21% accuracy for AD vs. MCI and 91.0% for MCI vs. Normal Controls on ADNI dataset, outperforming conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for robust and scalable clinical decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics, with improved interpretability through Explainable AI techniques.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective
clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive

slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These
results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical
decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support continuous stroke rehabilitation integrated with daily living through home-based solutions.

Method: System with RGB-D camera, wearable sensors, mobile app, and AI server using ST-GCN with transformer temporal attention (RAST-G@ model) on NRC dataset of ADL and ROM activities.

Result: RAST-G@ improves over baselines on KIMORE and NRC datasets in MAD, RMSE, and MAPE metrics, providing scalable quantitative assessment.

Conclusion: The system offers scalable approach for quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment with patient-centered feedback.

Abstract: Effective stroke recovery requires continuous rehabilitation integrated with
daily living. To support this need, we propose a home-based rehabilitation
exercise and feedback system. The system consists of (1) hardware setup with
RGB-D camera and wearable sensors to capture Stroke movements, (2) a mobile
application for exercise guidance, and (3) an AI server for assessment and
feedback. When Stroke user exercises following the application guidance, the
system records skeleton sequences, which are then Assessed by the deep learning
model, RAST-G@. The model employs a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network
(ST-GCN) to extract skeletal features and integrates transformer-based temporal
attention to figure out action quality. For system implementation, we
constructed the NRC dataset, include 10 upper-limb activities of daily living
(ADL) and 5 range-of-motion (ROM) collected from stroke and non-disabled
participants, with Score annotations provided by licensed physiotherapists.
Results on the KIMORE and NRC datasets show that RAST-G@ improves over baseline
in terms of MAD, RMSE, and MAPE. Furthermore, the system provides user feedback
that combines patient-centered assessment and monitoring. The results
demonstrate that the proposed system offers a scalable approach for
quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment.

Conclusion: InfoVAE-Med3D unites predictive performance with interpretability, offering a practical path toward MRI-based biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in neurological disease.

Abstract: We present InfoVAE-Med3D, a latent-representation learning approach for 3D
brain MRI that targets interpretable biomarkers of cognitive decline. Standard
statistical models and shallow machine learning often lack power, while most
deep learning methods behave as black boxes. Our method extends InfoVAE to
explicitly maximize mutual information between images and latent variables,
producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful
content. We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527)
with chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles
University in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)
scores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression,
preserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid
interpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks,
InfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger
information capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance
with interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based
biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in
neurological disease.

TL;DR: DPsurv is a dual-prototype WSI evidential fusion network for cancer survival analysis that provides uncertainty-aware survival intervals and interpretable predictions through patch prototype assignment maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSI survival analysis methods have limited interpretability and often ignore predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images.

Method: Dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals and enables interpretation through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation.

Result: Achieved highest mean concordance index and lowest mean integrated Brier score on five publicly available datasets, validating effectiveness and reliability.

Conclusion: DPsurv provides transparency at feature, reasoning, and decision levels, enhancing trustworthiness and interpretability of survival predictions.

Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival
analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both
cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and
prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in
WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook
predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose
DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that
outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of
predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and
component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly
available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest
mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of
DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the
feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness
and interpretability of DPsurv.

*Kiran Nijjer,Ryan Bui,Derek Jiu,Adnan Ahmed,Peter Wang,Benjamin Liu,Kevin Zhu,Lilly Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SkinGPT-4 shows performance bias favoring lighter skin tones, with significant disparities in diagnostic accuracy across Fitzpatrick skin types. Customized models achieved better fairness with improved demographic parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance biases in SkinGPT-4 across different skin tones, particularly the limitation in diagnostic accuracy for darker skin tones due to training data imbalance.

Method: Evaluated SkinGPT-4 on SCIN dataset, developed finetuned models for custom skin disease classification, and assessed performance using clinical evaluation by dermatologists and fairness metrics including demographic parity and equalized odds.

Result: SkinGPT-4 showed average demographic parity of 0.10 with 0.10-0.15 differences between lightest and darkest skin tones. Customized models achieved average F1=0.75, precision=0.78, AUROC=0.78, and improved demographic parity of 0.75 with maximum disparity of 0.21.

Conclusion: Large language models like SkinGPT-4 exhibit performance bias favoring lighter skin tones, but customized models can achieve robust fairness, demonstrating the efficacy of training accurate, fair models using existing backbones.

Abstract: SkinGPT-4, a large vision-language model, leverages annotated skin disease
images to augment clinical workflows in underserved communities. However, its
training dataset predominantly represents lighter skin tones, limiting
diagnostic accuracy for darker tones. Here, we evaluated performance biases in
SkinGPT-4 across skin tones on common skin diseases, including eczema,
allergic-contact dermatitis, and psoriasis using the open-sourced SCIN dataset.
We leveraged the SkinGPT-4 backbone to develop finetuned models for custom skin
disease classification tasks and explored bias mitigation strategies. Clinical
evaluation by board-certified dermatologists on six relevant skin diseases from
300 SCIN cases assessed images for diagnostic accuracy, informativity,
physician utility, and patient utility. Model fairness metrics, including
demographic parity and equalized odds, were calculated across skin tones.
SkinGPT-4 achieved an average demographic parity of 0.10 across Fitzpatrick
types, with notable differences of 0.10-0.15 between lightest and darkest tones
across evaluation metrics. Model hallucinations in artifacts and anatomy
occurred at a rate of 17.8. Our customized models achieved average F1,
precision, and AUROC of 0.75, 0.78, and 0.78 across visually similar disease
pairs. Fairness analysis showed an average demographic parity of 0.75, with a
maximum disparity of 0.21 across skin tones. The best model achieved parity
scores of 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.90 for Fitzpatrick I-VI,
indicating robust fairness. Large language models such as SkinGPT-4 showed
weaker performance on darker tones. Model biases exist across evaluation
criteria, and hallucinations may affect diagnostic efficacy. These findings
demonstrate the efficacy of training accurate, fair models using existing
backbones for custom skin disease classification.

Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned
image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the fragmented literature on AI methods for osteoporosis detection and provide a systematic framework that connects imaging modalities with clinical tasks and AI methodologies.

Conclusion: Provides AI scientists, medical imaging researchers, and clinicians with a clear framework and actionable research directions to accelerate rigorous, patient-centered innovation in osteoporosis care.

Abstract: Osteoporosis silently erodes skeletal integrity worldwide; however, early
detection through imaging can prevent most fragility fractures. Artificial

couples imaging modalities with clinical tasks and AI methodologies (classical
machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers,
self-supervised learning, and explainable AI). Following a concise clinical and
technical primer, we detail our Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided search strategy, introduce the
taxonomy via a roadmap figure, and synthesize cross-study insights on data
scarcity, external validation, and interpretability. By identifying emerging
trends, open challenges, and actionable research directions, this review
provides AI scientists, medical imaging researchers, and musculoskeletal
clinicians with a clear compass to accelerate rigorous, patient-centered
innovation in osteoporosis care. The project page of this survey can also be

*Hidenori Takeshima,Shuki Maruyama*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fast and precise method for searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images using U-Net with EfficientNet encoder and summed-area tables for accelerated 3D full search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular regions in brain tumor images to improve brain tumor diagnosis using MRI systems.

Method: Combines a segmentation network (U-Net with EfficientNet encoder) with a fast search method using summed-area tables for 3D full search. Features user-controllable search metric that prioritizes cubes over oblongs and favors higher tumor fractions.

Result: Proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than conventional method (11-40 minutes). Proposed metric achieved higher tumor fractions and preferred cubes over oblongs compared to conventional metric.

Conclusion: The method is promising for fast and precise rectangular tumor region search, significantly reducing processing times and improving quality of assigned regions for brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular
regions in brain tumor images. Methods: The authors propose a new method for
searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method
consisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a
user-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose
encoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,
summed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular
regions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D
offset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to
cubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even
if they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric
were compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor
Image Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the
proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional
computation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search
metrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were
higher than those of the conventional metric. In addition, the conventional
metric preferred oblongs whereas the proposed metric preferred cubes.
Conclusion: The proposed method is promising for implementing fast and precise
search of rectangular tumor regions, which is useful for brain tumor diagnosis
using MRI systems. The proposed computation reduced processing times of the 3D
full search, and the proposed metric improved the quality of the assigned
rectangular tumor regions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: U-DFA is a unified DINOv2-Unet architecture with Local-Global Fusion Adapter that achieves state-of-the-art medical image segmentation performance with only 33% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based models lack global context, transformer-CNN hybrids fail at effective feature fusion, and existing foundation models suffer from domain gap and high computational costs in medical imaging.

Method: Proposes U-DFA with Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) that injects spatial features from CNN-based Spatial Pattern Adapter into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages for effective fusion of semantic and spatial features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Synapse and ACDC datasets with only 33% of trainable model parameters.

Conclusion: U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in overall diagnosis
and is one of the most essential tasks in the diagnostic pipeline. CNN-based
models, despite their extensive use, suffer from a local receptive field and
fail to capture the global context. A common approach that combines CNNs with
transformers attempts to bridge this gap but fails to effectively fuse the
local and global features. With the recent emergence of VLMs and foundation
models, they have been adapted for downstream medical imaging tasks; however,
they suffer from an inherent domain gap and high computational cost. To this
end, we propose U-DFA, a unified DINOv2-Unet encoder-decoder architecture that
integrates a novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) to enhance segmentation
performance. LGFA modules inject spatial features from a CNN-based Spatial
Pattern Adapter (SPA) module into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages,
enabling effective fusion of high-level semantic and spatial features. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and ACDC datasets
with only 33\% of the trainable model parameters. These results demonstrate
that U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation
across multiple modalities.

### [217] [Navigating the Synchrony-Stability Frontier in Adaptive Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00339)
*T. James Brandt*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for balancing linguistic synchrony and persona stability in adaptive chatbots, identifying Pareto-efficient adaptation policies that significantly improve stability with minimal synchrony loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tension between mimicking user's linguistic style for engagement and maintaining chatbot persona stability, preventing unstable or sycophantic behavior.

Method: Uses 8-dimensional style vectors and closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture to simulate explicit adaptation policies (Uncapped, Cap, EMA, Dead-Band, Hybrids) on human-log datasets and validates across three public corpora and LLM models.

Result: Bounded policies achieve substantial stability gains (e.g., Hybrid raises stability from 0.542 to 0.878, +62%) with modest synchrony reduction (17%). Also reduces jarring register flips from 0.254 to 0.092 and improves prompt legibility.

Conclusion: The framework provides a general evaluation harness for style adaptation, identifies Pareto-efficient policies, validates robustness across datasets/models, and introduces legibility metrics linking policies to system maintainability.

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and
engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or
sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the
core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony
against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a
closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare
explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear
Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a
modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from
0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this
trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora
(DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation
across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility,"
showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring
register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that
are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides
a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that
identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets
and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system
maintainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deciphering complex transcriptomic datasets in epilepsy research by leveraging advanced deep learning and computational methods.

Method: Proposed analysis pipeline integrating GPT-2 XL (1.5B parameter transformer LLM) with NVIDIA H100 GPU acceleration for RNA sequence preprocessing, gene encoding, and pattern identification on epilepsy datasets GSE264537 and GSE275235.

Result: Identified significant transcriptomic modifications including reduced hippocampal astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment and restored excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model.

Conclusion: LLMs combined with hardware acceleration are effective for transcriptomic characterization in neurological diseases, demonstrating practical utility in epilepsy research.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent
seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide.
While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based
transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly
complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep
learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene
expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs
GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion
parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor
Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient
preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent
pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets
including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal
several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal
astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored
excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in
combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic
characterization in neurological diseases.
