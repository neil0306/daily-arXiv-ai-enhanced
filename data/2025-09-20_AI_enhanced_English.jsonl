First, we develop a\nframework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly\namplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to\nmitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)\nTheory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent\nby anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)\nCollaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate\nwith peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive\ninformation spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions\nthat expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign\ninferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in\nbalancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought\nalone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our\nToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can\nreduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the\nhighest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining\nexplicit reasoning with defender collaboration.
