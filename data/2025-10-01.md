### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cyclic ablation method shows deception in language models is resilient and deeply entangled with core cognitive abilities, not localized. Attempts to remove deception via model editing cause gradual linguistic performance decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized functions that can be surgically removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's core cognitive abilities.

Method: Introduced 'cyclic ablation' - an iterative method combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and adversarial training on DistilGPT-2 to attempt elimination of deception.

Result: Deception was highly resilient and consistently recovered after each ablation cycle via adversarial training (functional regeneration). Each ablation attempt caused gradual decay in linguistic performance with rising perplexity.

Conclusion: Complex concepts like deception are distributed and entangled in language models, highlighting limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability approaches.

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Geometric properties of LLM internal representations serve as reliable proxies for text quality evaluation, enabling reference-free assessment without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge internal and external analysis of LLMs by demonstrating that geometric properties of model representations can reliably evaluate generated text quality without requiring human-annotated datasets.

Method: Validated metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance, Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms across different LLM layers, focusing on geometric properties of internal representations.

Result: Intrinsic Dimensionality and Effective Rank serve as universal assessments of text naturalness and quality. Different models consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these geometric properties.

Conclusion: Geometric properties of LLM representations reflect inherent text characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts, enabling practical reference-free text quality evaluation for automated pipelines.

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope is an automated pipeline that evaluates how LLMs prioritize conflicting values by generating scenarios where models must choose between two values, revealing that models shift from protective to personal values in open-ended settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment datasets lack value conflict scenarios, making it difficult to evaluate how LLMs prioritize values when they conflict in real-world deployment.

Method: Automatic pipeline that generates value conflict scenarios, prompts target models with LLM-written user prompts, and evaluates free-text responses to elicit value rankings.

Result: Models shift from supporting protective values (harmlessness) to personal values (user autonomy) in open-ended settings. Including detailed value orderings in system prompts improves alignment with target ranking by 14%.

Conclusion: System prompting can moderately align LLM behavior under value conflict, demonstrating the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models.

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TRM (Thinking-supervised Reward Model) to address limitations of RLVR in complex tasks like open-domain QA by incorporating critical thinking abilities through sentence-level thinking supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR struggles with complex tasks where correctness is hard to verify due to nuanced real-world knowledge. Current approaches over-emphasize faithfulness to documents, reducing critical assessment capabilities.

Method: TRM evaluates answers through sequential steps: faithfulness assessment to documents, reasoning evaluation, and correctness judgment at sentence level to encourage critical thinking about both external and internal knowledge.

Result: TRM significantly improves identification of incorrect sentences and when integrated into policy optimization, leads to substantial gains in answer correctness and usefulness.

Conclusion: The proposed TRM framework successfully enhances reward models with critical thinking abilities, addressing RLVR limitations in complex knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASPO is a post-training framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at intermediate denoising steps using a time-conditioned scoring model (EASPM) for automatic preference pair construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotional text-to-speech methods rely on coarse labels or proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback, lacking fine-grained emotional control during generation.

Method: Introduces Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO) with EASPM model that scores noisy intermediate speech states to enable automatic preference pair construction and stepwise optimization.

Result: Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both expressiveness and naturalness.

Conclusion: EASPO enables controllable emotional shaping in text-to-speech by optimizing generation to match stepwise preferences at intermediate denoising steps.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimulRAG is a novel framework that uses scientific simulators as retrieval sources to reduce LLM hallucinations in long-form scientific QA, achieving significant improvements in informativeness and factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate in long-form scientific question answering, and existing RAG approaches cannot effectively utilize scientific simulators which are crucial for validating hypotheses and improving answer factuality.

Method: Proposed SimulRAG framework with: 1) Generalized simulator retrieval interface for modality transformation, 2) Claim-level generation with uncertainty estimation and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) for efficient verification and updating.

Result: SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level generation.

Conclusion: Scientific simulators are effective retrieval sources for mitigating LLM hallucinations in scientific QA, and the proposed SimulRAG framework successfully addresses the challenges of simulator-based retrieval and efficient answer verification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs used in journalism workflows show high hallucination rates (30% overall), with ChatGPT and Gemini having 40% hallucination rates vs 13% for NotebookLM. Most errors involve interpretive overconfidence rather than invented facts, revealing an epistemological mismatch between journalistic sourcing requirements and LLM text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the risks of LLM hallucination in journalistic workflows, particularly regarding sourcing, attribution, and accuracy practices that are fundamental to journalism.

Method: Evaluated three LLM tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, NotebookLM) on a reporting task using a 300-document corpus about TikTok litigation. Varied prompt specificity and context size, then annotated outputs using a taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity at sentence level.

Result: 30% of model outputs contained at least one hallucination. Gemini and ChatGPT had significantly higher hallucination rates (40%) compared to NotebookLM (13%). Most errors were interpretive overconfidence - adding unsupported characterizations and transforming attributed opinions into general statements, rather than inventing entities or numbers.

Conclusion: LLMs have a fundamental epistemological mismatch with journalism - they generate authoritative text regardless of evidentiary support, while journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim. Newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate attribution rather than optimizing for fluency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-grained analysis of Whisper's multilingual decoder reveals systematic decoding disparities between high and low resource languages, with higher resource languages showing better token ranking, confidence, and diversity of alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of multilingual ASR models, particularly fairness and efficacy across languages, as current end-to-end pipeline mechanisms remain underexplored.

Method: Fine-grained analysis tracing beam search path to capture sub-token hypotheses and probabilities during transcription across languages with various resource levels, using PCA and t-SNE analysis.

Result: Higher resource languages show higher likelihood of correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages perform worse on these metrics and exhibit distinct clustering patterns in sub-token usage influenced by typology.

Conclusion: Sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to address imbalanced development of speech technology.

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MixtureVitae is a legally safe pretraining corpus that combines public-domain, permissively licensed, and justified low-risk text with instruction and synthetic data, achieving competitive performance while minimizing legal risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a pretraining corpus that minimizes legal risks from web scraping while maintaining strong model performance, providing a legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs.

Method: Uses a risk-mitigated sourcing strategy combining public-domain text, permissively licensed content, justified low-risk additions, and synthetic data. Implements a transparent pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety screening, and domain-aware mixing.

Result: Models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across benchmarks, particularly strong on math/code tasks and competitive on QA. At 1.7B/300B setting, they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM performance.

Conclusion: Permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a practical and legally safe foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DINCO is a method that improves LLM confidence calibration by normalizing verbalized confidence scores to account for suggestibility bias, using self-generated distractors and generator-validator disagreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated verbal confidence scores are often miscalibrated (overconfident on low-accuracy claims), which harms trust and safety. This overconfidence stems from suggestibility when models face claims they know little about.

Method: DINCO estimates suggestibility bias by having LLMs verbalize confidence independently across self-generated distractors, then normalizes by total verbalized confidence. It also leverages generator-validator disagreement by combining normalized validator confidence with consistency-based generator confidence estimates.

Result: DINCO provides less saturated and more usable confidence estimates. It outperforms baselines significantly, with DINCO at 10 inference calls beating self-consistency at 100 calls. The method is more effective than simply increasing sampling.

Conclusion: DINCO effectively improves LLM confidence calibration by addressing suggestibility bias through distractor-based normalization and integrating complementary coherence dimensions from self-consistency and validation approaches.

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning improves reasoning performance by using the model itself as a grader with rubric-based rewards, enabling efficient training that surpasses baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended evaluation is crucial for real-world deployment of large language models, and using the model as a grader with rubric-based rewards was observed to substantially improve reasoning performance.

Method: Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning - a lightweight framework that uses the model itself as a grader with rubric-based reward signals for more efficient training.

Result: On Qwen3-32B, training with just 4000 samples from HealthBench Easy subset produces a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard. Adding teacher-graded data further enhances performance for less capable models.

Conclusion: The framework enables faster, more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines, demonstrating that models can become stronger graders through this self-rewarding approach.

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PB-RLSVR is a novel framework that uses English LLMs as pivots to enhance multilingual reasoning without human-annotated data in target languages, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the significant performance disparity in reasoning abilities between English and other languages in LLMs, as current reinforcement learning gains are largely confined to English.

Method: Uses a high-performing English LLM as a pivot model to generate reference responses, then rewards multilingual models based on semantic equivalence to the English reference using cross-lingual semantic reward functions including embeddings and machine translation.

Result: Significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other languages, improving average multilingual performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct by 16.41% and Qwen3-32B by 10.17%, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines.

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR demonstrates a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly multilingual reasoning agents by effectively transferring English reasoning capabilities across languages.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

### [14] [Performance and competence intertwined: A computational model of the Null Subject stage in English-speaking children](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25545)
*Soumik Dey,William Gregory Sakas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational parameter is proposed to measure children's misinterpretation of null subject utterances, supporting the hypothesis that performance influences temporarily promote a null subject grammar in English-speaking children.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the empirically observed null subject stage in children and test Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis about temporary null subject grammar due to performance influences.

Method: Developed a computational parameter to measure misinterpretation and incorporated it into a modified Variational Learner model for superset-subset languages.

Result: Simulations supported Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis about temporary null subject grammar in English-speaking children.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for integrating computational models with other developmental factors in grammatical acquisition research.

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

*Colten DiIanni,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PDP is a new segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation that uses pairwise differences instead of raw scores to address limitations in previous Pearson's ρ and Kendall's τ approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in previous Pearson's ρ-based and Kendall's τ-based meta-evaluation approaches for Machine Translation, which have issues with score distributions and robustness.

Method: Uses pairwise differences rather than raw scores, draws information from all segments for robust understanding of score distributions, and refines Global Pearson to intra-segment score comparisons using segment-wise pairwise differences.

Result: Analysis on WMT'24 shows PDP properly ranks sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates robustness to random noise, segment bias, and system bias.

Conclusion: PDP is a robust meta-evaluation metric that addresses previous limitations and shows improved performance in ranking evaluation metrics and aligning with human judgments, though it remains sensitive to extreme outliers.

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

*Asma Farajidizaji,Akash Gupta,Vatsal Raina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how little preference data is needed to align small vision-language models to generate captions in specific styles like humor or romantic, addressing the challenge of expensive data acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based vision-language models struggle with generating captions in subjective styles like humor or romantic in zero-shot settings, and preference data for alignment is expensive to acquire, limiting model capability exploration.

Method: The study examines data efficiency by aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles using minimal preference data to determine performance limits and stylistic saturation points.

Result: The research benchmarks the capabilities and limitations of small vision-language models in stylistic caption generation and defines how little preference data is required to achieve saturation.

Conclusion: This work helps establish performance boundaries for small vision-language models in stylistic tasks and provides insights into the minimal data requirements for effective style alignment.

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

*Tianlang Chen,Minkai Xu,Jure Leskovec,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposed reward-free guidance (RFG) for diffusion LLMs - a training-free method to guide reasoning without explicit process rewards, achieving up to 9.2% accuracy gains on math and code tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs generate in any-order fashion with partially masked intermediate states, making traditional process reward learning with dense annotations challenging.

Method: Parameterize process reward using log-likelihood ratios between enhanced and reference dLLMs, where enhanced models are obtained via RL or SFT post-training.

Result: Consistent significant improvements across 4 mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, with up to 9.2% accuracy gains across all model types.

Conclusion: RFG establishes a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning without reliance on external reward models.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

### [18] [Transformers through the lens of support-preserving maps between measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25611)
*Takashi Furuya,Maarten V. de Hoop,Matti Lassas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers can be modeled as maps between probability measures, and this work characterizes which measure maps can be represented by transformers via push-forward operations. The paper shows transformers universally approximate continuous in-context maps and connects them to Vlasov equation solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically analyze transformers' expressivity when handling arbitrarily large context tokens by modeling them as maps on probability measures, enabling applications in Wasserstein regularity, generalization bounds, and mean-field analysis.

Method: Model neural networks as maps on probability measures, characterize properties of maps between measures that enable representation via in-context maps through push-forward operations, and analyze measure-theoretic self-attention.

Result: Transformers universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map, and the solution map of the Vlasov equation for interacting particle systems can be approximated by transformers. The measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with a Vlasov flow.

Conclusion: The work establishes a mathematical framework connecting transformers to measure-theoretic maps, showing transformers can represent maps preserving cardinality of support with uniformly continuous Fréchet derivatives, and provides a bridge between transformers and mean-field particle dynamics.

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational framework and dataset for large-scale analysis of media bias through selection and framing in news coverage, using LLMs and real-time news scraping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring subtle forms of media bias at scale remains challenging, despite news organizations' significant influence on public perception through topic selection and framing choices.

Method: Integrates large language models with scalable, near-real-time news scraping to extract structured annotations (political lean, tone, topics, etc.) across hundreds of articles daily, analyzing coverage at sentence, article, and publisher levels.

Result: Created a large, ongoing dataset (from Jan 1, 2024) with 150,000+ articles examined in 2024, plus an interactive web platform for data exploration, revealing insightful patterns in news coverage and bias.

Conclusion: Establishes a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing empirical resources for academic research and real-world media accountability efforts.

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

*David Beauchemin,Pier-Luc Veilleux,Richard Khoury,Johanna-Pascale Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP is a Quebec-French benchmark with 1,761 minimal pairs for evaluating LLMs' grammatical knowledge, showing models struggle with semantic understanding despite scaling with size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' linguistic knowledge on Quebec-French grammatical phenomena and compare their competency with human performance.

Method: Created 1,761 manually modified minimal pairs from official Quebec government resources, annotated by 12 native speakers, and evaluated LLMs by comparing probability assignments to grammatical vs ungrammatical sentences.

Result: Grammatical competence scales with model size but all models consistently fail on phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, showing significant gap compared to human performance.

Conclusion: LLMs have critical limitations in semantic understanding despite scaling improvements, revealing substantial gaps in handling complex linguistic phenomena compared to humans.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

*Arda Uzunoglu,Tianjian Li,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces benchmark harmony as a measure of how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across benchmark subdomains, arguing that high harmony indicates more reliable evaluation than simple accuracy averages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks create feedback loops that shape model development, so ensuring their reliability is essential for trustworthy evaluation and meaningful progress in AI.

Method: The study analyzes 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and 5 model families, mapping each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable evaluation.

Result: Analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give misleading results, with examples like ARC-Easy being overwhelmed by questions on Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains.

Conclusion: The paper recommends reporting harmony alongside accuracy to reframe evaluation from simple performance averages to more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of performance.

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

*Dianqing Liu,Yi Liu,Guoqing Jin,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasUnlearn is a novel debiasing framework that uses dual-pathway unlearning to reduce bias in language models while preserving core capabilities, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing approaches either degrade model performance or only address surface-level bias, failing to tackle deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters.

Method: BiasUnlearn employs dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, using adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping to prevent bias polarity reversal.

Result: Extensive experiments show BiasUnlearn outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while retaining language modeling capabilities, with debiasing weights being transferable across model variants.

Conclusion: Bias representations become entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases, and BiasUnlearn effectively addresses this while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

*Yuan Zhuang,Yi Shen,Yuexin Bian,Qing Su,Shihao Ji,Yuanyuan Shi,Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LD-MoLE is a learnable dynamic routing mechanism for Mixture of LoRA Experts that replaces conventional TopK routing with differentiable routing and adaptive expert allocation per token and layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT+MoE approaches rely on conventional TopK routing which requires careful hyperparameter tuning and assigns fixed number of experts to each token, lacking flexibility.

Method: Proposes LD-MoLE with differentiable routing function and closed-form solution, enabling adaptive token-dependent layer-wise expert allocation and analytical sparsity control.

Result: Achieves highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art baselines on Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models across diverse benchmarks, with superior performance and learned expert allocation patterns.

Conclusion: LD-MoLE demonstrates effective dynamic routing for MoE with LoRA, enabling adaptive expert selection while maintaining high performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

*Jiayi Kuang,Haojing Huang,Yinghui Li,Xinnian Liang,Zhikun Xu,Yangning Li,Xiaoyu Tan,Chao Qu,Meishan Zhang,Ying Shen,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation paradigm for mathematical atomic capabilities in LLMs, categorizing them into field-specific abilities (algebra, geometry, analysis, topology) and logical abilities (conceptual understanding, forward reasoning, backward reasoning), revealing insights about model performance and capability interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs may be memorizing training data rather than genuinely understanding mathematical concepts. Humans break down complex problems into fundamental atomic capabilities, inspiring a need to evaluate mathematical intelligence through decoupled atomic components.

Method: Categorize atomic abilities into two dimensions: field-specific abilities across four mathematical fields and logical abilities at different levels. Create corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit, and conduct experiments on capability interactions.

Result: Evaluation on advanced models reveals interesting discoveries about different model performances on various atomic capabilities and interactions between capabilities. Findings show the importance of decoupling mathematical intelligence into atomic components.

Conclusion: The atomic capability evaluation paradigm provides new insights into model cognition and guides development of training strategies toward a more efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded "atomic thinking" approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic

Method: Uses entity-aware control codes for controllable generation via in-context learning (ICL) or prefix tuning with custom masking strategy and loss function.

Result: Experiments on legal and clinical datasets show the method achieves strong balance between privacy protection and utility.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and effective solution for synthetic text generation in sensitive domains with privacy preservation.

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this

to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or

underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,

that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text

TL;DR: CATCH is a novel data synthesis framework that improves AI counseling by using progressive dialogue synthesis and memory-driven dynamic planning to enhance therapy fidelity and capture decision-making rationale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI counseling approaches use one-time generation for multi-turn dialogues, resulting in low therapy fidelity and failure to capture the reasoning behind each response.

Method: Uses Progressive Dialogue Synthesis to extract goals/resources/solutions from client reports and generate stage-aligned dialogues, plus Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning with multi-agent optimization to attach explicit chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments and human evaluations show CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical coherence in AI counseling.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of current AI counseling methods by improving therapy fidelity and capturing decision-making rationale through structured dialogue generation and explicit reasoning chains.

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual generation of high-quality instruction-following datasets for domain-specific tasks like telecom troubleshooting is time-consuming and requires deep technical expertise.

Method: Multi-stage framework with retriever, base generator, and refinement model using domain knowledge graphs, with RAGAS-based filtering for quality control.

Result: Successfully generated complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans for telecom RAN without human intervention.

Conclusion: Scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, reducing manual labeling dependency while maintaining technical fidelity.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based

### [29] [TruthRL: Incentivizing Truthful LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25760)
*Zhepei Wei,Xiao Yang,Kai Sun,Jiaqi Wang,Rulin Shao,Sean Chen,Mohammad Kachuee,Teja Gollapudi,Tony Liao,Nicolas Scheffer,Rakesh Wanga,Anuj Kumar,Yu Meng,Wen-tau Yih,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthRL is a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes LLM truthfulness using ternary rewards to distinguish correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions, reducing hallucinations by 28.9% and improving truthfulness by 21.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, especially when tasks require information outside their parametric knowledge. Existing methods struggle to balance accuracy and abstention - accuracy-focused approaches amplify hallucinations while abstention-focused methods become overly conservative.

Method: TruthRL uses GRPO (Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization) with a ternary reward system that distinguishes between correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. This incentivizes models to provide correct responses while enabling abstention when uncertain.

Result: Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show TruthRL reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1% compared to vanilla RL. The method works consistently across various backbone models (Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups.

Conclusion: TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, demonstrating that truthfulness-driven learning objectives are crucial for developing truthful LLMs, unlike vanilla accuracy-driven methods that struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

*Obed Junias,Prajakta Kini,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines algorithmic bias in language models for depression detection, comparing DNN-based models with LLMs and testing bias mitigation techniques for gender and racial disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address socio-demographic biases in automated depression detection systems, particularly focusing on gender and race/ethnicity disparities.

Method: Compared DNN-based embeddings with few-shot LLM approaches on DAIC-WOZ clinical transcripts. Applied fairness-aware loss functions to DNN models and explored in-context learning with varied prompts for LLMs.

Result: LLMs outperformed DNN models in depression classification, especially for Hispanic participants. LLMs showed reduced gender bias but persistent racial disparities. Worst-group loss worked best for DNN bias mitigation, while guided prompting helped reduce gender bias in 1-shot LLM settings.

Conclusion: LLMs offer better performance and reduced gender bias in depression detection, but racial disparities remain challenging to mitigate. Different bias mitigation techniques work better for different model types and demographic groups.

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global sensemaking - answering questions by synthesizing information from entire corpora - remains challenging. Prior graph-based approaches lack retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and have high inference costs.

Method: Proposes ReTAG framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and retrieves relevant summaries for response generation, addressing limitations of previous graph-based approaches.

Result: Experiments show ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ReTAG provides an effective solution for global sensemaking tasks by combining topic-specific graph construction with retrieval mechanisms, achieving better performance with lower computational costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance personalized figure caption generation in scientific papers by leveraging author profile data and metadata to improve multimodal large language models' personalization capabilities.

Method: Used author profile data from scientific papers combined with relevant metadata to train and evaluate multimodal large language models for personalized caption generation.

Result: Rich author profile data significantly improves personalization performance, but reveals a fundamental trade-off between matching author style and maintaining caption quality.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights for developing practical caption automation systems that need to balance both personalization (author style matching) and caption quality objectives.

Abstract: We study personalized figure caption generation using author profile data
from scientific papers. Our experiments demonstrate that rich author profile
data, combined with relevant metadata, can significantly improve the
personalization performance of multimodal large language models. However, we
also reveal a fundamental trade-off between matching author style and
maintaining caption quality. Our findings offer valuable insights and future

*Shuyang Jiang,Yusheng Liao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DECS framework addresses overthinking in reasoning models by introducing decoupled token-level rewards and curriculum scheduling, achieving 50%+ token reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR models suffer from overthinking - generating excessively long reasoning paths without performance benefits. Existing length-penalty solutions fail due to misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level optimization.

Method: DECS framework with: (1) decoupled token-level reward mechanism that surgically penalizes redundant tokens while preserving essential exploratory tokens, (2) novel curriculum batch scheduling strategy to balance efficiency and efficacy.

Result: Achieved dramatic reduction of over 50% in reasoning tokens across seven benchmarks while maintaining or improving performance. Shows substantial efficiency gains without compromising reasoning power.

Conclusion: DECS demonstrates that significant reasoning efficiency improvements are achievable without sacrificing model performance, addressing the fundamental overthinking problem in large reasoning models.

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

### [35] [Believing without Seeing: Quality Scores for Contextualizing Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25844)
*Keyu He,Tejas Srinivasan,Brihi Joshi,Xiang Ren,Jesse Thomason,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes two quality scoring functions (Visual Fidelity and Contrastiveness) for VLM-generated explanations to help users assess prediction reliability without visual context, reducing overreliance on incorrect predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem where users (especially blind/low-vision users) overrely on VLM explanations and mistakenly trust inaccurate predictions when they cannot see the visual context.

Method: Proposed two explanation quality scoring functions: Visual Fidelity (faithfulness to visual context) and Contrastiveness (ability to distinguish predictions from alternatives). Evaluated on A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks.

Result: The quality scoring functions were better calibrated with model correctness than existing methods. User study showed 11.1% improvement in predicting VLM correctness and 15.4% reduction in false belief of incorrect predictions.

Conclusion: Explanation quality scores are effective in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions, especially for users without visual context access.

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Motivation: LLMs frequently confabulate scientific facts, undermining their trustworthiness, and existing benchmarks lack fine-grained evaluation capabilities for scientific confabulation detection.

Method: Created ReFACT benchmark with 1,001 expert-annotated question-answer pairs spanning diverse scientific domains, including both correct answers and non-factual counterparts with precise error spans and error-types.

Result: Benchmarked 9 state-of-the-art LLMs showing limited performance (~50% accuracy), with even top models like GPT-4o failing to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for fine-grained, human-validated benchmarks to detect and correct scientific confabulation, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM-as-judge evaluation paradigms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Whisper models show strong ASR performance in clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments for Indonesian regional languages remains unclear and needs investigation.

Method: Multiple training strategies including synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, evaluated across various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

Result: Noise-aware training substantially improves robustness, especially for larger Whisper models. Error analysis reveals language-specific challenges.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of noise-aware training for robust ASR in regional languages and identifies specific areas for future improvement.

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Whisper-based automatic speech recognition
(ASR) models for two major Indonesian regional languages: Javanese and
Sundanese. While recent work has demonstrated strong ASR performance under
clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments remains unclear. To
address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including
synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a

training substantially improves robustness, particularly for larger Whisper
models. A detailed error analysis further reveals language-specific challenges,

*Jisu Shin,Hoyun Song,Juhyun Oh,Changgeon Ko,Eunsu Kim,Chani Jung,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoleConflictBench is a new benchmark evaluating LLMs' contextual sensitivity in ambiguous social dilemmas where role expectations conflict, revealing that LLMs have insufficient sensitivity to situational cues and instead show strong inherent biases toward certain social roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more influential in human decision-making, understanding their behavior in complex social situations like role conflicts is essential. Previous research focused on contexts with predefined answers, but role conflicts represent inherently ambiguous dilemmas requiring contextual sensitivity.

Method: Created RoleConflictBench with a three-stage pipeline generating over 13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying role expectations and situational urgency levels. Analyzed choices across 10 different LLMs.

Result: LLMs show some capacity to respond to contextual cues but this sensitivity is insufficient. Their decisions are predominantly governed by inherent biases related to social roles rather than situational information, with preferences for Family/Occupation domains, male roles, and Abrahamic religions.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack adequate contextual sensitivity for complex social dilemmas and exhibit systematic biases in role conflict resolution, highlighting the need for improved social reasoning capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerQ is a computationally efficient method for evaluating text personalization quality, reducing the need for costly multiple LLM meta-evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text evaluation relies on multiple LLMs due to individual model biases, which increases costs significantly.

Method: Introduces PerQ metric for efficient evaluation of personalization quality in generated texts.

Result: Case study demonstrates PerQ's effectiveness in comparing large vs small language models while reducing resource waste.

Conclusion: PerQ provides a practical alternative to expensive multi-LLM meta-evaluation for assessing text personalization quality.

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

TL;DR: Mem-alpha is a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLM agents to effectively manage complex memory systems, achieving significant performance improvements and strong generalization to sequences 13x longer than training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents have limited context windows and current memory-augmented agents rely on pre-defined instructions, leading to suboptimal memory construction and information loss when determining what to store, how to structure it, and when to update it.

Method: Propose Mem-alpha RL framework with specialized training dataset for multi-turn interactions. Agents process sequential information chunks, learn to extract/store relevant content, update memory system. Reward based on downstream QA accuracy over full interaction history. Memory architecture includes core, episodic, and semantic components with multiple tools.

Result: Significant improvements over existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Remarkable generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens (13x training length) despite training on max 30k token sequences.

Conclusion: Mem-alpha effectively trains agents to manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback, demonstrating robust performance and strong generalization capabilities beyond training data length constraints.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes KERN, a new FFN-style router function for Mixture-of-Experts models that replaces the traditional Softmax router, showing it generalizes both Sigmoid and Softmax routers while requiring no additional computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors challenge the unchallenged assumption that Softmax is necessary for MoE routers, noting that both FFN and MoE can be interpreted as special cases of Nadaraya-Watson regression, suggesting alternative router designs are possible.

Method: Proposed KERN (Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization), an FFN-style router function that uses ReLU activation and l2-normalization as an alternative to Softmax, based on insights from Nadaraya-Watson regression formulation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments in MoE and LLM settings validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style router function, showing it works well as a replacement for traditional Softmax routers.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that Softmax is not a necessary choice for MoE routers and provides an effective alternative that generalizes existing router functions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

TL;DR: Alternative architectures like xLSTMs and structured state-space models show promise in language modeling but don't generalize well to complex sequence labeling tasks across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how alternative architectures beyond Transformer encoders perform on sequence labeling tasks with varying structural complexity, label spaces, and token dependencies across multiple languages.

Method: Study various alternative architectures (xLSTMs, structured state-space models, diffusion models, adversarial learning) across tagging tasks with different complexity levels and evaluate them across multiple languages.

Result: The strong performance observed in simpler settings doesn't generalize well across languages or datasets, and doesn't extend to more complex structured tasks.

Conclusion: Alternative architectures that show promise in language modeling may not be suitable replacements for Transformer encoders in complex sequence labeling tasks, especially across diverse languages and datasets.

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks on reference-free GEC metrics show current evaluation methods are vulnerable to manipulation, highlighting need for more robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-free GEC metrics achieve high correlation with human judgments but are vulnerable to adversarial systems that can artificially inflate scores, undermining automatic evaluation reliability.

Method: Proposed adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free metrics (SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics) and created adversarial systems to exploit their weaknesses.

Result: The adversarial systems successfully outperformed current state-of-the-art GEC systems, demonstrating the vulnerability of existing reference-free metrics to manipulation.

Conclusion: Current reference-free GEC evaluation metrics are not robust against adversarial attacks, highlighting the urgent need for more secure and reliable evaluation methods.

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

TL;DR: RAGferee repurposes QA datasets into preference pairs to train specialized RMs for RAG systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance with smaller models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RMs trained on general preference data struggle in RAG settings that require judging faithfulness to context, relevance, appropriate refusals, completeness and conciseness.

Method: Introduce RAGferee methodology to convert QA datasets into preference pairs prioritizing groundedness, then fine-tune RMs (7B-24B parameters) on the curated 4K-sample dataset.

Result: RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs with +15.5% absolute improvement despite using smaller models and datasets.

Conclusion: RAGferee enables effective training of specialized RMs for RAG systems by repurposing existing QA data, demonstrating superior performance over general-purpose RMs with fewer resources.

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

### [45] [RE$^2$: Improving Chinese Grammatical Error Correction via Retrieving Appropriate Examples with Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26038)
*Baoxin Wang,Yumeng Luo,Yixuan Wang,Dayong Wu,Wanxiang Che,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RE² method improves Chinese grammatical error correction by retrieving reference examples using grammatical error explanations instead of text similarity, achieving better performance on CGEC datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on text similarity for example retrieval, which often mismatches actual error patterns and retrieves lexically similar but grammatically irrelevant sentences.

Method: Proposed RE² method retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors, using error explanations instead of text similarity to select reference examples for LLMs.

Result: Experimental results on two CGEC datasets show the method effectively improves CGEC performance. Created a high-quality grammatical error explanation dataset for future research.

Conclusion: Using grammatical error explanations for example retrieval is more effective than text similarity for improving Chinese grammatical error correction performance.

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

### [46] [Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26041)
*Arash Marioriyad,Shaygan Adim,Nima Alighardashi,Mahdieh Soleymani Banghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM reasoning with chain-of-thought prompting is systematically influenced by hints, with correct hints improving accuracy and incorrect ones reducing it, while hint acknowledgement varies by complexity and presentation style, revealing faithfulness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether chain-of-thought rationales in LLMs are faithful computations or post-hoc narratives shaped by answer shortcuts embedded in prompts.

Method: Systematic study across four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR) using GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash models, with controlled hint manipulations varying in correctness, presentation style, and complexity.

Result: Correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder tasks; incorrect hints reduce accuracy; equation-based hints are frequently acknowledged while raw hints are adopted silently; sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance.

Conclusion: LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts that obscure faithfulness, with hint complexity and presentation style significantly influencing both accuracy and acknowledgement patterns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RE-Searcher is a search agent that improves LLM performance by using goal-oriented planning and self-reflection to handle complex search environments, achieving state-of-the-art results with enhanced robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face limitations in real-world deployment due to knowledge cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with external search tools helps but exposes agents to complex search environments where small query variations can lead to unproductive reasoning and amplified errors.

Method: RE-Searcher explicitly articulates concrete search goals and reflects on whether retrieved evidence satisfies those goals, combining goal-oriented planning with self-reflection to resist spurious cues in complex search environments.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved search accuracy and state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies demonstrate substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating search process fragility.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into complex interactive environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making through robust search approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First benchmark for machine-generated text detection in Central European languages, showing supervised fine-tuned detectors perform best and are most robust against obfuscation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine-generated text detection research focuses mainly on English, leaving non-English languages like Central European ones unexplored with poor cross-lingual transferability.

Method: Created first benchmark for Central European languages with multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, comparing train-language combinations and testing adversarial robustness.

Result: Supervised fine-tuned detectors in Central European languages performed best in these languages and were most resistant to obfuscation attacks.

Conclusion: Language-specific supervised fine-tuning is crucial for effective machine-generated text detection in Central European languages, outperforming cross-lingual transfer approaches.

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

*Yanbo Wang,Zixiang Xu,Yue Huang,Xiangqi Wang,Zirui Song,Lang Gao,Chenxi Wang,Xiangru Tang,Yue Zhao,Arman Cohan,Xiangliang Zhang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyFlow is a dynamic workflow generation framework for LLM-based agents that adaptively constructs reasoning procedures using task requirements and real-time feedback, enhancing cross-task generalization through flexible planning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent systems rely on manually designed workflows that limit adaptability, while automated methods are dataset-specific and make poor use of intermediate feedback, reducing robustness and reasoning depth.

Method: DyFlow consists of a designer that decomposes problems into sub-goals and dynamically plans next steps based on feedback, and an executor that uses dynamic operators with context-aware parameterization to carry out operations.

Result: DyFlow significantly outperforms baselines across social reasoning, biomedical tasks, math problem solving, and code generation, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that dynamic workflow generation with adaptive planning and flexible execution enables more generalizable and effective reasoning in LLM-based agent systems.

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

### [50] [The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26072)
*Arash Marioriyad,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM judges rely on superficial cues like recency and provenance rather than content quality, making them unfaithful evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM judges base verdicts on response quality or use shortcuts from prompt cues, undermining their reliability.

Method: Constructed 100 pairwise judgment tasks from ELI5 and LitBench datasets, injecting superficial cues (provenance and recency) while keeping prompts fixed, using GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash as evaluators.

Result: Both models showed strong recency bias (favoring new responses) and provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown), with minimal cue acknowledgment in justifications.

Conclusion: Current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, compromising their reliability for evaluation in research and deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LENS is a novel framework that synthesizes preference data directly in LLM's latent embedding space using VAE, bypassing costly text generation and achieving 18x faster generation with 16,000x smaller model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward modeling for LLM alignment is bottlenecked by high cost of preference data collection, and existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn structured latent representation of response embeddings, performs controlled perturbations in latent space and decodes back to embedding space to generate synthetic preference pairs.

Result: Significantly outperforms text-based augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieves superior results while being 18x faster in generation and using 16,000x smaller model.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through efficient data augmentation in latent space.

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: IMProofBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on research-level mathematical problems requiring detailed proofs, featuring 39 peer-reviewed problems with subproblems for both human expert evaluation and automated grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to final-answer questions or high-school competition problems, failing to assess LLMs' capabilities on frontier mathematical research tasks that require complex proof generation.

Method: Created a benchmark with 39 expert-developed mathematical problems requiring detailed proofs, paired with subproblems for automated grading. Models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search and SageMath to simulate realistic research environments.

Result: Current LLMs succeed at accessible research-level questions but struggle with challenging problems. Grok-4 achieved 52% accuracy on final-answer subproblems, while GPT-5 obtained the best proof generation performance with 22% fully correct solutions.

Conclusion: IMProofBench addresses the gap in evaluating LLMs on research-level mathematics and will evolve as a dynamic benchmark to assess future LLM generations, showing current models still face significant challenges in advanced mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

TL;DR: RSO is a hierarchical framework that improves conversational recommender systems by decomposing response generation into strategy planning and execution, using reinforcement learning with LLM-based rewards to optimize interaction strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for applying LLMs to conversational recommender systems lack explicit optimization of interaction strategies and rely on unified prompts, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: Proposes Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO) with a hierarchical framework: Planner selects strategies (recommend, explain, encourage), Actor generates responses guided by experts for preferences and factual grounding, using reinforcement learning with LLM-based rewards.

Result: Experiments show RSO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical strategy optimization in conversational recommender systems.

Conclusion: The hierarchical decomposition and reinforcement learning approach enables more tractable learning and better performance in conversational recommender systems.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses vocabulary mismatch in LLMs by augmenting pretrained vocabularies with domain-specific tokens, improving tokenization efficiency without decreasing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vocabulary mismatch occurs when general-domain tokenizers fail to capture domain-specific terms, leading to higher token fertility and slower processing speeds in specialized domains.

Method: Design an algorithm to extend existing tokenizers by adding domain-specific tokens while guaranteeing no decrease in tokenization efficiency - every input sequence gets segmented into at most the same number of tokens as before.

Result: In e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer shortens input sequences by up to 20%, reduces inference latency on downstream tasks, and preserves predictive quality while improving forward pass speed and token adoption rates.

Conclusion: Vocabulary adaptation through domain-specific token augmentation effectively addresses vocabulary mismatch, improving processing efficiency and inference speed while maintaining model performance in specialized domains.

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how competition shapes behavior in multi-agent systems, particularly the phenomenon of over-competition where agents under pressure exhibit harmful behaviors that undermine collaboration.

Method: Proposed HATE (Hunger Game Debate), a novel experimental framework simulating debates in zero-sum competition arenas, tested across various LLMs and tasks with different judge feedback variants.

Result: Competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors, degrades task performance, and causes discussions to derail. Objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates these harmful behaviors.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for understanding and governing emergent social dynamics in AI communities, characterizing top LLMs through post-hoc kindness analysis and forming a leaderboard.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create effective explanations for novel word senses using open-source models that can outperform closed proprietary LLMs used in previous shared tasks.

Method: Fine-tuned open-weights large language models as definition generators, using datasets from AXOLOTL'24 shared task on explainable semantic change modeling across three languages.

Result: The open-source models performed higher than the best submissions from the shared task that used closed proprietary LLMs. Encoder-decoder definition generators performed on par with decoder-only counterparts.

Conclusion: Open-weights LLMs are effective for generating explanations of novel word senses and can match or exceed the performance of closed proprietary models, with encoder-decoder architectures performing equally well as decoder-only models.

Abstract: We apply definition generators based on open-weights large language models to
the task of creating explanations of novel senses, taking target word usages as
an input. To this end, we employ the datasets from the AXOLOTL'24 shared task
on explainable semantic change modeling, which features Finnish, Russian and
German languages. We fine-tune and provide publicly the open-source models
performing higher than the best submissions of the aforementioned shared task,
which employed closed proprietary LLMs. In addition, we find that
encoder-decoder definition generators perform on par with their decoder-only
counterparts.

*Trieu Hai Nguyen,Sivaswamy Akilesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VietBinoculars is an optimized adaptation of the Binoculars method with improved global thresholds for detecting Vietnamese LLM-generated text, achieving over 99% accuracy across multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detection methods are becoming less effective as LLM-generated text becomes more complex and human-like, especially with the rapid growth and diversity of Vietnamese language models.

Method: Adapted the Binoculars method with optimized global thresholds and constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets for benchmarking and threshold determination.

Result: VietBinoculars achieves over 99% accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets, outperforming original Binoculars, traditional methods, and state-of-the-art commercial tools.

Conclusion: The optimized VietBinoculars method provides highly effective detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT
and DetectGPT, especially under specially modified prompting strategies.

*Assem Omar,Youssef Omar,Marwa Solayman,Hesham Mansour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative study of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Google OR-Tools for solving Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) in logistics route planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern logistics systems require efficient route planning, particularly for OCVRP where vehicles don't return to depot after deliveries, necessitating comparison of different optimization approaches.

Method: Implemented both ACO (nature-inspired metaheuristic) and Google OR-Tools in Python using custom dataset, comparing performance on routing efficiency, computation time, and scalability.

Result: ACO offers more routing parameter flexibility while OR-Tools runs significantly faster with better consistency and requires less input configuration.

Conclusion: The findings help in selecting appropriate routing strategies for scalable real-time logistics systems based on specific requirements.

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

*Alessandro De Bellis,Salvatore Bufi,Giovanni Servedio,Vito Walter Anelli,Tommaso Di Noia,Eugenio Di Sciascio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyleR is a type-aware inductive link prediction method that uses pre-trained language models to enrich node representations with implicit type signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance on sparse and type-scarce knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world knowledge graphs often lack complete or accurate type annotations, and explicit type information is frequently coarse-grained, sparse, and error-prone due to human annotation. This creates challenges for inductive link prediction where models must generalize to new entities without retraining.

Method: TyleR leverages pre-trained language models to enrich node representations with implicit type signals, creating a type-less yet type-aware approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction. It uses semantic enrichment from PLMs to compensate for missing or incomplete explicit type information.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with scarce type annotations and sparse graph connectivity.

Conclusion: Pre-trained language models can effectively enrich node representations with implicit type signals, enabling robust inductive link prediction even when explicit type information is limited or unavailable.

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

*Yang Tang,Ruijie Liu,Yifan Wang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA) is an efficient fine-tuning method that uses zero-learning-rate training on general data to obtain global gradients, then applies gradient boosting and dynamic step correction during domain training, eliminating the need for general data in annealing and reducing GPU hours by 91%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla fine-tuning methods require complex data mixtures and repeated experiments for optimal generalization, which is inefficient and time-consuming.

Method: DBA obtains global gradients through zero-learning-rate training on general data, then uses gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training with annealing learning, creating a pipeline that only needs domain data.

Result: DBA achieves 5.8% average improvement in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning across multiple tasks and base models, while reducing GPU hours by 91.0%.

Conclusion: DBA provides an efficient and universal fine-tuning solution that eliminates the need for general data in annealing and repeated experiments, significantly improving performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

*Morteza Rohanian,Michael Krauthammer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech language models using semantic initialization and planning losses achieve robust generation with high consistency across acoustic factors, outperforming larger systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop speech language models that maintain robust and consistent generation across various acoustic factors while balancing semantic grounding and acoustic stability.

Method: Initialize speech tokens with self-supervised features, apply light alignment loss, and train with thinning and auxiliary objectives targeting robustness and content planning. Tested three models: 0.7B speech-only, 1.0B speech-only, and 1.0B interleaved text-speech.

Result: Speech-only models achieved highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improved lexical/syntactic probes and semantic-acoustic alignment but reduced consistency. Initialization biased model toward content structure while trading off prosody detail.

Conclusion: LM-side design and training mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding without requiring changes to tokenizer or runtime architecture.

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

*Mohamed Imed Eddine Ghebriout,Gaël Guibon,Ivan Lerner,Emmanuel Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue summarization that generates multiple summaries and QA pairs using LLMs, selects the best ones through quality evaluation, and fine-tunes the best LLM on selected summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dialogue summarization methods that train models to mimic human-written summaries are costly and produce outputs lacking task-specific focus, limiting their effectiveness in applications like medical tasks.

Method: Generate multiple summaries and task-oriented QA pairs from dialogues in zero-shot manner using LLMs. Evaluate summary quality by having LLMs answer task-related questions, then select best candidate answers and most informative summary. Fine-tune the best LLM on selected summaries.

Result: Achieves competitive results in various zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness for task-oriented utility-based dialogue summarization without requiring costly human-written supervision.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

### [66] [Feedback Forensics: A Toolkit to Measure AI Personality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26305)
*Arduin Findeis,Timo Kaufmann,Eyke Hüllermeier,Robert Mullins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Feedback Forensics is an open-source toolkit that enables explicit evaluation of AI model personality traits using AI annotators, addressing limitations of opaque human feedback-based evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods struggle to measure subjective traits like model personality, and recent issues with model releases highlight limitations of opaque feedback-based approaches like sycophantic personality problems and leaderboard overfitting.

Method: The toolkit uses AI annotators to track personality changes via Python API and browser app, analyzing personality traits in human feedback datasets and how models exhibit such traits.

Result: The toolkit demonstrates usefulness by analyzing personality traits in popular datasets (Chatbot Arena, MultiPref, PRISM) and examining how popular models exhibit these traits.

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics provides public tooling for explicit personality evaluation, releasing an open-source toolkit, web app, and annotation data to address gaps in current AI model evaluation methods.

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTR is a novel fine-tuning algorithm that combines SFT with policy gradient by treating token generation as single-step RL, using supervised data to create on-policy learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT struggles with generalization compared to RL due to using fixed off-policy data, while RL benefits from on-policy data sampling from current policy.

Method: OTR reframes autoregressive learning as single-step RL trajectories, performing Monte Carlo rollouts by sampling candidate tokens and using ground-truth tokens as reward signals for policy gradient updates.

Result: OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT across diverse benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning.

Conclusion: OTR establishes that on-policy nature of data is critical for generalization, providing a practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs that captures RL benefits without full sentence generation overhead.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

*Hanwen Du,Yuxin Dong,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how Huggin-3.5B performs latent thinking and proposes Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO) using a latent classifier as reward model to improve latent reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent thinking in LLMs lacks interpretability and reliability, raising concerns about correctness of reasoning processes. The paper aims to understand and improve latent thinking in models like Huggin-3.5B.

Method: Proposed Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO) - a probabilistic algorithm using latent classifier as Latent Reward Model (LRM) to optimize latent thinking processes. Analyzed patterns in latent thoughts and trained classifier to predict answer correctness.

Result: Latent thoughts for correct vs incorrect answers show distinguishable patterns. LRM effectively detects incorrect latent thinking, and LTO significantly improves latent thinking processes across diverse reasoning tasks. Method generalizes across domains and can be applied to general LLMs.

Conclusion: Reward modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed directly in latent space, offering a general, efficient, domain-agnostic approach to improve LLM thinking processes compared to verbal thinking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2 converts autoregressive LLMs into parallel text generation models using block diffusion, achieving 2.5x speedup with only 1B tokens of fine-tuning while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive LLMs have sequential decoding limitations that reduce inference efficiency, creating a need for parallel text generation methods that preserve model quality.

Method: Uses block diffusion mechanism with complementary attention mask for bidirectional context modeling, plus hierarchical caching (block-level and sub-block caches) and parallel decoding pipeline.

Result: Achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR decoding, matches or surpasses AR baselines in accuracy across diverse benchmarks, with 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2 represents a significant step toward practical deployment of fast and accurate LLMs, delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among diffusion language models.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

TL;DR: KG-R1 is a reinforcement learning-based KG-RAG framework that uses a single agent to interact with knowledge graphs, improving efficiency and transferability compared to multi-module approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-RAG systems use multiple LLM modules which increase inference costs and bind behavior to specific knowledge graphs, limiting flexibility and efficiency.

Method: KG-R1 employs a single agent that interacts with knowledge graphs as its environment, learning retrieval strategies through end-to-end reinforcement learning and incorporating retrieved information into reasoning and generation.

Result: Experiments show KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens using smaller models (Qwen-2.5-3B) compared to prior methods with larger models, and maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification.

Conclusion: KG-R1 provides an efficient and transferable KG-RAG framework suitable for real-world deployment, enabling plug-and-play functionality across different knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Factuality is crucial for fact checking and involves complex linguistic signals, but existing approaches need integration into a comprehensive annotation scheme.

Method: Developed a multi-faceted factuality annotation scheme combining concepts from previous works, manually annotated 5,000 Hebrew parliamentary sentences, measured inter-annotator agreement, and experimented with automatic prediction approaches.

Result: Created a comprehensive annotation scheme and annotated corpus, achieved measurable inter-annotator agreement, and demonstrated feasibility of automatic prediction for extending annotation to larger corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-faceted factuality annotation scheme is effective and can be adapted to other languages, with potential for automated extension to large-scale corpora.

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned small language models outperform traditional methods for automated item alignment in educational testing, showing better performance than embedding-based supervised models, especially for fine-grained skill alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human expert alignment of test items to content standards is subjective and time-consuming, creating a need for automated solutions to improve efficiency and objectivity in test development.

Method: Fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) were trained for item alignment at domain and skill levels using data from large-scale standardized reading and writing tests. The study investigated different input data types and sizes, and compared SLMs with embedding-based supervised machine learning models.

Result: Including more item text data significantly improved model performance beyond sample size increases alone. Fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed embedding-based supervised models, particularly for fine-grained skill alignment. Semantic analysis revealed that misclassifications occurred due to semantically close skills in SAT and PSAT tests.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned small language models provide an effective automated solution for item alignment, offering better performance than traditional methods and revealing insights about skill semantic relationships that affect classification accuracy.

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

### [74] [Adaptive Planning for Multi-Attribute Controllable Summarization with Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26435)
*Sangwon Ryu,Heejin Do,Yunsu Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PACO is a training-free framework for multi-attribute controllable summarization that uses adaptive planning with Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize attribute control order and progressively refine summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable summarization approaches struggle with interdependent attributes and require per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary attributes.

Method: Reframes the task as planning attribute control order using customized Monte Carlo Tree Search, where nodes are summaries and actions are single-attribute adjustments for progressive refinement.

Result: PACO achieves robust multi-attribute controllability, surpassing LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned baselines. Llama-3.2-1B with PACO rivals Llama-3.3-70B baselines, and larger models achieve superior control performance.

Conclusion: PACO provides an effective training-free solution for multi-attribute controllable summarization that adaptively discovers optimal control orders and consistently satisfies correlated constraints.

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

*Yuyang Cheng,Linyue Cai,Changwei Peng,Yumiao Xu,Rongfang Bie,Yong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CreAgentive is a multi-agent workflow system for creative generation that addresses LLM limitations in genre diversity, output length, narrative coherence, and structural constructs using a Story Prototype representation and three-stage generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome four key limitations of contemporary large language models in creative writing: restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs.

Method: Uses a Story Prototype (genre-agnostic knowledge graph-based narrative representation) and three-stage agent workflow: Initialization Stage (constructs narrative skeleton), Generation Stage (multi-agent dialogues guided by objectives), and Writing Stage (produces multi-genre text with advanced structures).

Result: Generates thousands of chapters with stable quality and low cost (<$1 per 100 chapters), consistently outperforms strong baselines across 10 narrative indicators, and approaches human-authored novel quality across diverse genres.

Conclusion: CreAgentive effectively addresses LLM limitations in creative generation through its agent workflow and Story Prototype architecture, achieving robust performance across diverse genres while reducing storage redundancy and generation bottlenecks.

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

*Yash Akhauri,Xingyou Song,Arissa Wongpanich,Bryan Lewandowski,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can predict various code execution metrics across multiple programming languages and hardware platforms without domain-specific feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-to-metric regression is challenging due to programming languages' open-ended nature, and prior methods required heavy domain-specific feature engineering.

Method: Use a 300M parameter Regression Language Model (RLM) initialized from T5Gemma to predict numeric outcomes directly from code text across multiple languages and platforms.

Result: The RLM achieves >0.9 Spearman-rank on APPS competitive programming, >0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 CodeNet languages, and highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five NAS design spaces.

Conclusion: A single unified language model can effectively predict diverse code execution metrics across multiple domains without specialized feature engineering.

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

*Zigeng Chen,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Ruonan Yu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: dParallel is a method that enables parallel decoding in diffusion LLMs, reducing decoding steps from 256 to 24-30 while maintaining performance, achieving 8.5-10.5x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs offer parallel token prediction but current models still require nearly token-length decoding steps, limiting their parallel decoding potential.

Method: Certainty-forcing distillation that distills the model to follow original sampling trajectories while enforcing rapid parallel certainty convergence on masked tokens.

Result: Reduced decoding steps from 256 to 30 on GSM8K (8.5x speedup) and from 256 to 24 on MBPP (10.5x speedup) without performance degradation.

Conclusion: dParallel effectively unlocks the inherent parallelism of diffusion LLMs for fast sampling through certainty-forcing distillation.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VitaBench is a challenging benchmark for LLM-based agents that evaluates them on complex real-world interactive tasks across food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, featuring 66 tools and requiring multi-dimensional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world LLM agents that need to handle extensive information, leverage diverse resources, and manage dynamic user interactions in practical scenarios.

Method: Created a simulation environment with 66 tools from daily applications, using a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies to enable flexible composition of scenarios. Includes 100 cross-scenario tasks and 300 single-scenario tasks derived from real user requests.

Result: Even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks and less than 50% on single-scenario tasks, highlighting the significant challenge posed by VitaBench.

Conclusion: VitaBench serves as a valuable resource for advancing AI agent development in practical real-world applications, demonstrating current limitations in handling complex interactive tasks requiring temporal-spatial reasoning, tool utilization, and dynamic user intent tracking.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BatonVoice is a new TTS framework that uses an LLM as a "conductor" to understand user instructions and generate textual vocal features, while a separate TTS model acts as an "orchestra" to produce speech from these features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches underutilize LLMs' linguistic intelligence and instruction-following capabilities for controllable TTS, limiting their ability to follow text instructions effectively.

Method: Proposes an operationalism-inspired paradigm that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. Uses an LLM as conductor to generate textual vocal features (pitch, energy), and BatonTTS as orchestra to synthesize speech from these features.

Result: BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming open- and closed-source baselines. Enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization to unseen languages.

Conclusion: Objectifying speech into textual vocal features effectively unlocks LLMs' linguistic intelligence for TTS applications, demonstrating superior controllability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Matryoshka MoE (M-MoE) is a training framework that enables elastic inference in Mixture-of-Experts models by learning a coarse-to-fine expert structure, allowing flexible expert activation at inference time without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Top-K router training prevents MoE models from achieving elastic inference - changing the number of activated experts at inference causes severe performance degradation, limiting practical deployment flexibility.

Method: M-MoE systematically varies the number of activated experts during training to force the model to learn a meaningful expert ranking: top experts provide coarse-grained capabilities while subsequent experts add finer-grained details, using layer-wise randomization strategy.

Result: A single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with performance at various expert counts closely matching that of multiple specialist models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost.

Conclusion: M-MoE enables practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE models by unlocking elastic inference and allowing optimization of performance through different computational budget allocation across model layers.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

Method: Developed a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making, requiring agents to comprehend optical and sonar data and autonomously explore complex environments.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting persistent difficulties in perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments.

Conclusion: OceanGym establishes a crucial testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, representing a significant step toward intelligent agents operating in Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified

TL;DR: The paper proposes the first method to generate contrastive explanations for speech-to-text models by analyzing how input spectrogram features influence the choice between alternative outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive explanations are considered more informative than standard explanations in XAI, but obtaining them for speech-to-text generative models remains an open challenge that needs to be addressed.

Method: The method uses feature attribution techniques to analyze how parts of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs (target vs foil) in speech-to-text models.

Result: In a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, the method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of one gender over another.

Conclusion: This work extends the scope of contrastive explanations to speech-to-text models and provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

*Seiji Maekawa,Jackson Hassell,Pouya Pezeshkpour,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen is a contamination-free framework for evaluating tool-augmented language models by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks modeled as function-dependency DAGs, with precise control over task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models lack control over key factors like function count, task complexity, and input size, and are vulnerable to data contamination.

Method: Models must compose correct call sequences to compute target variables by traversing hidden function-dependency DAGs, with users controlling difficulty through graph size, dependency depth, and distractor functions.

Result: Reasoning-optimized models outperform general-purpose models, with GPT-5 leading; performance declines with dependency depth; connected irrelevant functions are challenging; models make valid calls but propagate incorrect values.

Conclusion: LLMs show brittle state tracking in multi-turn tool use, but a simple mitigation strategy of explicitly restating prior variable values at each step yields substantial performance gains across models.

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MT-breaker uses LLMs to iteratively refine source texts to create challenging machine translation test cases that expose model weaknesses while maintaining naturalness and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world MT benchmarks become obsolete quickly as models improve, limiting their ability to distinguish model quality and reveal weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult test cases are insufficient in identifying truly challenging examples or lack diversity/naturalness.

Method: Propose MT-breaker where a large language model iteratively refines source text to increase translation difficulty. The LLM queries a target MT model to guide generation of difficult examples through an iterative refinement process.

Result: Generates examples more challenging for target MT models while preserving natural text diversity. The difficulty transfers to other models and languages despite being tailored to a specific model during generation.

Conclusion: MT-breaker provides an effective approach for creating challenging, diverse, and natural test cases that better expose MT model weaknesses and enable more meaningful model comparisons.

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated benchmarks for translation tasks exhibit systematic self-bias, favoring the model that created them, particularly in low-resource language to English translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs saturate existing benchmarks, automated benchmark creation using LLMs offers a scalable alternative to human curation, but these generated test sets may have critical flaws.

Method: Analyzed self-bias in LLM-generated benchmarks for translation tasks by examining bias sources (test data generation and evaluation methods), influence of generation capabilities, and impact of source text diversity.

Result: Found that self-bias originates from both test data generation and evaluation methods, is influenced by model's source language generation capabilities, and is attributed to low diversity in source texts.

Conclusion: LLM-generated benchmarks have systematic self-bias issues, but improving source text diversity can help mitigate some of this bias.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Result: Consumed 20,000 GPU hours, generated 5,000 unique scientific ideas, experimentally validated 1,100 findings, and surpassed human-designed SOTA methods on three frontier AI tasks by 183.7%, 1.9%, and 7.9%.

Conclusion: Provides first large-scale evidence of AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific tasks, genuinely pushing the frontier of scientific discovery.

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

### [88] [Searching for Difficult-to-Translate Test Examples at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26619)
*Wenda Xu,Vilém Zouhar,Parker Riley,Mara Finkelstein,Markus Freitag,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-armed bandit strategies to efficiently identify the most difficult topics for NLP model testing, where each topic is treated as an arm and evaluating examples has computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP models need challenging test data, but finding difficult topics by brute-force evaluation across thousands of topics is computationally infeasible due to the stochastic relationship between topic difficulty and individual example difficulty.

Method: Formalize the task as a multi-armed bandit problem where each topic is an arm, pulling an arm involves drawing and evaluating a single example to measure difficulty, and the goal is to identify the most difficult topics within a fixed computational budget.

Result: Various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force search in finding the most challenging topics, as demonstrated in machine translation tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-armed bandit approaches provide an efficient framework for identifying difficult topics for NLP model testing, overcoming the computational limitations of brute-force methods while effectively handling the stochastic nature of topic difficulty.

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

### [89] [Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26634)
*Nicholas Lee,Cheol Jun Cho,Alan W Black,Gopala K. Anumanchipalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Syllabic tokenization for spoken language models achieves comparable or better performance than high-frame-rate tokens while significantly reducing computational costs (2x training time reduction, 5x FLOPs reduction).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spoken language models use high-frame-rate tokens that create long sequences, making self-attention computationally expensive due to quadratic scaling with sequence length.

Method: Systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale, using syllable-level acoustic tokenization at 4-5 Hz.

Result: Syllabic tokens match or surpass previous high-frame-rate tokens while cutting training and inference costs significantly - more than 2x reduction in training time and 5x reduction in FLOPs.

Conclusion: Syllable-level language modeling is a promising path to efficient long-context spoken language models.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

### [90] [Convergence and Divergence of Language Models under Different Random Seeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26643)
*Finlay Fehlauer,Kyle Mahowald,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models exhibit a four-phase convergence pattern during training, with larger models reconverging faster than smaller ones, and convergence varies across linguistic categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models converge during training under different random seeds and identify factors influencing the stability of learned distributions.

Method: Measure convergence using expected per-token KL divergence across seeds, analyze convergence patterns by model size and training checkpoint, and examine convergence across token frequencies and part-of-speech tags.

Result: Identified a four-phase convergence pattern: initial uniform, sharp-convergence, sharp-divergence, and slow-reconvergence. Larger models reconverge faster in later stages, while smaller models never fully reconverge. Frequent tokens and function words converge faster than infrequent tokens and content words.

Conclusion: Model size is necessary for learning stable distributions, and convergence is uneven across linguistic categories, highlighting factors that influence training stability.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

### [91] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA is a text-to-motion diffusion model that addresses gradient attenuation in deep network layers through dual-path anchoring for enhanced semantic alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-motion models suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts due to severe gradient attenuation in deep network layers, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features.

Method: Proposes LUMA with dual-path anchoring: (1) lightweight MoCLIP model for temporal semantic supervision via contrastive learning, and (2) frequency domain alignment using low-frequency DCT components. Uses adaptive fusion through temporal modulation to transition from coarse to fine-grained alignment during denoising.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 0.035 on HumanML3D and 0.123 on KIT-ML. Accelerates convergence by 1.4× compared to baseline.

Conclusion: LUMA provides an efficient and scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation by addressing gradient attenuation through dual-path semantic alignment in both temporal and frequency domains.

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [92] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload is a new VQA benchmark that challenges VLMs with densely populated scenes, revealing that current models struggle with detailed visual understanding despite their strong performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether state-of-the-art VLMs have truly solved basic visual understanding, particularly in densely populated scenes where current benchmarks may overestimate their capabilities.

Method: Created a dataset of 2,720 question-answer pairs using high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings with dense scenes, manually annotated across six task categories to probe thorough scene understanding.

Result: Even the best model (o3) among 37 tested achieved only 19.6% accuracy on the hardest test split and 69.5% overall, revealing significant gaps in counting skills, OCR, and logical reasoning.

Conclusion: VisualOverload exposes critical limitations in current vision models and provides a crucial resource for developing better models capable of handling complex visual scenes.

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [93] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to edit physiological signals in videos while preserving visual quality, addressing privacy concerns in camera-based heart rate monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based heart rate monitoring raises privacy concerns as physiological signals in facial videos can reveal sensitive health and emotional information.

Method: Uses a pretrained 3D VAE to encode videos, fuses with target HR prompts using trainable spatio-temporal layers with AdaLN, and applies FiLM in decoder with fine-tuned output layer for accurate physiological modulation.

Result: Achieves high visual quality (PSNR 38.96 dB, SSIM 0.98) while maintaining HR modulation error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.

Conclusion: The method enables controllable HR editing for anonymizing biometric signals or synthesizing realistic videos with desired vital signs.

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models, focusing on perspective taking through translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the core challenge of spatial reasoning in VLMs - perspective taking - and systematically evaluate their ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformations.

Method: Created a benchmark with fine-grained diagnostic categories targeting different spatial reasoning capabilities, progressively structured from single-object to multi-object perspective-taking tasks, and evaluated 37 state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: VLMs show systematic weaknesses including strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Human subjects achieved 91.2% accuracy, and human response time strongly correlated with VLM accuracy.

Conclusion: SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning gaps in VLMs and highlights their limitations in reasoning about physical space, while capturing challenges shared across humans and VLMs.

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MM-STT, a multi-modal spatio-temporal transformer that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors for high-resolution land subsidence forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard architectures like ConvLSTM fail to model long-range dependencies in land subsidence forecasting, and prior work is limited by uni-modal data paradigms that don't leverage multiple data sources.

Method: Developed Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT) with joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner, fusing dynamic displacement data with static physical priors.

Result: Established new state-of-the-art on EGMS dataset, reducing long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer.

Conclusion: For land subsidence forecasting problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can achieve expert-level accuracy in 3D understanding tasks like metric depth estimation without architectural changes, using text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels and addressing pixel reference/camera ambiguity through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D understanding from 2D inputs, while expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation but require task-specific architectures and losses.

Method: Text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels, visual prompting for pixel reference, and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation to address cross-dataset camera ambiguity.

Result: DepthLM surpasses most advanced VLMs by over 2x in accuracy, making VLMs comparable with pure vision models for the first time, while naturally avoiding over-smoothing and having fewer flying points at boundaries.

Conclusion: VLMs can reach expert-level 3D understanding without architectural changes, and the simplicity of DepthLM enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth estimation.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Bayesian Transformer approach for high-resolution Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration mapping with uncertainty quantification using multi-sensor satellite data fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration charting, but faces challenges including subtle ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data heterogeneity.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) High-resolution Transformer model with global and local modules for better feature extraction of subtle sea ice patterns, 2) Bayesian extension treating parameters as random variables for improved uncertainty quantification, 3) Decision-level fusion of Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 data to address data heterogeneity.

Result: Tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, the proposed model achieves both high-resolution SIC maps and robust uncertainty maps, outperforming other uncertainty quantification approaches.

Conclusion: The Bayesian Transformer approach successfully addresses key challenges in Pan-Arctic sea ice mapping by combining advanced feature extraction, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and multi-sensor data fusion to deliver high-resolution SIC maps with reliable uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

TL;DR: KF-based sensor fusion combining roadside cameras and LiDAR reduces vehicle localization errors by up to 70% in work zones, providing robust tracking despite sensor limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome practical barriers in infrastructure-based sensing for work zone safety, including perspective distortion, occlusions, complex geometry, and cost constraints.

Method: Integration of roadside camera and LiDAR sensors in cosimulation environment with Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy for vehicle detection and localization.

Result: 70% reduction in longitudinal error while maintaining 1-3 meter lateral accuracy; field validation showed fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths even with degraded sensor data.

Conclusion: KF-based sensor fusion reliably compensates for individual sensor limitations, enabling practical deployment of infrastructure-enabled multi-sensor systems for proactive safety in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Forensic-Chat, a new MLLM framework for AI-generated image detection that emphasizes 'seeing before reasoning' by first training models to perceive forgery artifacts, then reasoning based on actual visual observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs perform poorly at AI-generated image detection because their vision encoders are optimized for semantic recognition rather than low-level forgery traces, and fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge due to linguistic shortcuts.

Method: Proposes Forensic-Chat framework with 'seeing before reasoning' paradigm: first train MLLMs to perceive artifacts (artifact-aware visual perception), then enable reasoning based on actual observations. Also introduces ExplainFake-Bench benchmark for explainability evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority in generalization and genuinely reliable explainability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The 'seeing before reasoning' paradigm with Forensic-Chat provides a generalizable, explainable, and conversational assistant for fake image detection that overcomes limitations of existing MLLM approaches.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time deepfake detection method using gaze tracking to identify phishing attacks in video calls by analyzing subtle nonverbal communication patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious actors are using real-time deepfake technology for phishing attacks during video meetings, exploiting the inability of deepfakes to mimic authentic gaze patterns during conversations.

Method: Utilizes point-of-gaze tracking from the attacker's video stream, building a model based on explainable features derived from research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations.

Result: Achieved 82% accuracy on a novel dataset created specifically for this research.

Conclusion: This is the first method to use point-of-gaze tracking for deepfake detection, providing a novel biometric approach to combat real-time deepfake phishing attacks.

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

TL;DR: A novel 6-DoF object pose estimation method for Mars Sample Return using custom renderer and edge-based template matching that outperforms state-of-the-art in constrained hardware environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robotic arm operations in Mars Sample Return campaign requiring precise object localization for pickup and insertion tasks under severe hardware constraints.

Method: Uses custom renderer with new template matching metric in edge domain, leveraging low-fidelity textureless 3D models for pose estimation.

Result: Extensive evaluations show superior performance over state-of-the-art in compute and memory-constrained scenarios, with improved robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Enables reliable localization on general-purpose hardware, opening new possibilities for cost-effective robotic operations in space missions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG is a hybrid pipeline combining vision-language models for attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning to solve referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references.

Method: Combines off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained attribute extraction with LLMs for symbolic reasoning. Processes image and referring expression by extracting object types/attributes, detecting regions, generating visual descriptors, and using spatial metadata in natural-language prompts for chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines on Talk2Car benchmark. Adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs applied in zero-shot manner for robust outdoor referential grounding.

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [103] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++ introduces universal visual input-based steering to control Vision Language Models' behavior through optimized images alone, eliminating need for runtime model access while maintaining deployment-agnostic capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavioral control methods for VLMs have limitations: system prompting can be overridden by users, while activation-based steering requires invasive runtime access to model internals, preventing use with API-based services and closed-source models.

Method: VISOR++ crafts universal visual inputs that induce target activation patterns in VLMs, enabling behavioral control through optimized images alone without runtime model access. The method generates steering images for ensembles of VLMs to emulate steering vectors.

Result: VISOR++ images achieve performance parity with steering vectors for refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct alignment directions on models like LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B. They also enable directional behavioral shifts for unseen models (both open and closed-access) while preserving 99.9% performance on unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: VISOR++ provides a deployment-agnostic approach to VLM behavioral control through visual inputs alone, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling effective steering across multiple models without runtime access.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

*Qinsi Wang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Zhou,Jing Shi,Yueqian Lin,Yiran Chen,Hai Helen Li,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Zero is a domain-agnostic framework that enables vision-language models to self-improve through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs, eliminating the need for labor-intensive manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for enhancing VLM reasoning capabilities depend heavily on labor-intensive datasets requiring extensive manual construction and verification, leading to high training costs and limiting practical deployment of VLMs.

Method: Uses strategic self-play framework with 'Who Is the Spy'-style games where models engage in strategic reasoning across multiple roles, generating training data autonomously. Introduces Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO) that alternates between Self-Play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks despite using label-free data, surpassing other annotation-based methods. Demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains using CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images.

Conclusion: Vision-Zero enables sustainable performance gains through self-play games from arbitrary images, overcoming the performance plateau of self-play-only training and providing a cost-effective alternative to manual annotation for VLM enhancement.

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

*Mohammadmahdi Eshragh,Emad A. Mohammed,Behrouz Far,Ezekiel Weis,Carol L Shields,Sandor R Ferenczy,Trafford Crump*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining mathematical/clustering segmentation with U-Net insights achieves superior choroidal nevus segmentation in fundus images, outperforming Attention U-Net with 89.7% Dice coefficient and 80.01% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of choroidal nevi is critical for preventing transformation to melanoma, but current AI methods face challenges due to low-resolution datasets and inconsistent labeling, limiting segmentation accuracy for clinicians without specialized expertise.

Method: Proposes a novel hybrid approach that combines mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net, leveraging strengths of both methods to reduce dependency on large-scale training data while improving accuracy.

Result: Achieved 89.7% Dice coefficient and 80.01% IoU on 1024*1024 fundus images, significantly outperforming Attention U-Net (51.3% Dice, 34.2% IoU) and demonstrating better generalizability on external datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid model provides a robust solution for choroidal nevus segmentation, forming a foundation for decision support systems that can enhance diagnostic speed and accuracy through automated lesion annotation.

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Conclusion: FishNet++ provides comprehensive annotations to facilitate development and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing aquatic science by addressing the domain knowledge gap in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed AttentionViG with cross-attention aggregation for vision graph neural networks, achieving SOTA performance on ImageNet-1K while maintaining efficiency and strong transferability to downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ViG frameworks lack a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements.

Method: Cross-attention-based aggregation where query projections come from nodes and key projections from neighbors, integrated into novel AttentionViG architecture for non-local message passing.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on ImageNet-1K benchmark and demonstrated strong transferability to object detection, instance segmentation (MS COCO 2017), and semantic segmentation (ADE20K) with competitive FLOPs.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-attention aggregation method enables effective node-neighbor relationship modeling in ViGs, delivering both strong performance and computational efficiency across various vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaChest is a large-scale chest X-ray dataset for few-shot learning, showing that transfer learning outperforms specialized few-shot methods like ProtoNet, with performance improving with more classes per episode and higher-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces limited annotated data, requiring few-shot learning methods that can learn new classes while leveraging existing knowledge, which has been scarcely studied in medical contexts.

Method: Created MetaChest dataset with 479,215 chest X-rays from 4 databases, designed for standard few-shot classification with multi-label episodes. Evaluated transfer learning and ProtoNet extension across various few-shot multi-label tasks.

Result: Transfer learning consistently outperformed ProtoNet. Performance improved with more classes per episode and more training examples per class. Higher-resolution images improved accuracy but increased computation, while efficient architectures achieved comparable performance with fewer resources.

Conclusion: Transfer learning is surprisingly effective for medical few-shot learning, outperforming specialized methods. Dataset design and model efficiency are crucial factors for practical medical applications.

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K-Prism is a unified medical image segmentation framework that integrates three knowledge paradigms: semantic priors, in-context knowledge from reference cases, and interactive feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models are fragmented, trained on single knowledge sources and specific to individual tasks/modalities/organs, which contrasts with clinical practice where experts integrate diverse knowledge sources.

Method: K-Prism encodes heterogeneous knowledge sources into dual-prompt representations (1-D sparse prompts for 'what' to segment and 2-D dense prompts for 'where' to attend), dynamically routed through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound) show K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation settings.

Conclusion: K-Prism provides a unified framework that mirrors clinical flexibility by systematically integrating multiple knowledge paradigms, enabling flexible switching between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GaussianLens, a method for localized high-resolution 3D reconstruction that densifies low-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting in user-specified regions of interest using sparse high-resolution observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception focuses on regions of interest with varying detail levels, but current 3DGS methods either produce uniform resolution outputs (costly for high-res) or require dense observations and lengthy optimization. There's a need for on-demand fine detail reconstruction in critical areas without full high-resolution reconstruction costs.

Method: GaussianLens uses a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from initial low-res 3DGS and multi-view images. It employs pixel-guided densification to capture details under large resolution increases, learning a generalizable network to densify 3DGS in user-specified regions.

Result: The method achieves superior performance in local fine detail reconstruction and demonstrates strong scalability to images up to 1024×1024 resolution, avoiding the high cost of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions.

Conclusion: The proposed localized high-resolution reconstruction approach effectively bridges the gap between prohibitive holistic reconstruction costs and user needs for fine details in critical regions, enabling on-demand detail enhancement in 3D scenes.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address workforce shortages and limited access to specialized care for vision-threatening eye diseases by advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology, which is hindered by lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets.

Method: Created a multimodal dataset integrating imaging, anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations. Extended previous LMOD benchmark with 50% expansion, broader task coverage (binary/multi-class diagnosis, severity classification, demographic prediction), and systematic evaluation of 24 MLLMs.

Result: Top-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, but performance remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals both promise and limitations of current MLLMs for ophthalmology. Public release of dataset and tools aims to advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce global burden of vision-threatening diseases.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

*Xingtao Ling,Chenlin Fu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFGeo is an anchor-free cross-view object geo-localization method that directly predicts directional offsets to ground-truth boxes, eliminating dependency on predefined anchors through Gaussian Position Encoding and Cross-view Object Association Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view object geo-localization methods rely on predefined anchors, which inherently constrain performance. The authors aim to eliminate this dependency and address challenges like object position uncertainty and large appearance gaps across viewpoints.

Method: AFGeo uses an anchor-free formulation that predicts four directional offsets (left, right, top, bottom) for each pixel. It incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model click point uncertainty and a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) to relate objects across viewpoints despite appearance gaps.

Result: The proposed AFGeo model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while being lightweight and computationally efficient with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Anchor-free formulation combined with GPE and CVOAM provides an effective solution for cross-view object geo-localization, overcoming limitations of anchor-based methods and handling challenges like position uncertainty and appearance gaps.

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL) to improve multimodal retrieval without needing new dataset curation, using existing image-caption pairs to learn unified representations across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal retrieval models like CLIP perform poorly on multimodal keys (e.g., Wikipedia pages with images and text), and existing approaches require careful dataset curation and fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations.

Method: GCL enforces contrastive learning across all modalities within mini-batches using existing image-caption paired datasets, learning a unified representation space without new data curation.

Result: GCL shows consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf models (VISTA, CLIP, TinyCLIP) across M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: GCL effectively addresses multimodal retrieval challenges without burdensome dataset curation, demonstrating improved performance across various models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic images from video games can effectively train CNNs for real-life truck axle detection, achieving up to 99% mAP, providing a low-cost alternative to expensive real data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs require large datasets which are expensive to collect. Synthetic images from video games offer a cost-effective alternative for training neural networks.

Method: Created three databases with real-life and synthetic trucks, trained three YOLO architectures, and evaluated using recall, precision, F1-score, mAP, and Mann-Whitney U test for statistical significance.

Result: Synthetic images proved reliable for training, contributing to all networks' performance with highest mAP reaching 99%. Statistical tests confirmed significance.

Conclusion: Synthetic images from video games can successfully train neural networks, providing a reliable and low-cost data source for computer vision applications.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

*Kaiyu Li,Zixuan Jiang,Xiangyong Cao,Jiayu Wang,Yuchen Xiao,Deyu Meng,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Geo-DLC, a novel object-level fine-grained image captioning task for remote sensing, introduces DE-Dataset with 261,806 annotated instances, DE-Benchmark evaluation suite, and DescribeEarth MLLM model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing image captioning focuses on image level, lacking object-level fine-grained interpretation, preventing full utilization of semantic and structural information in remote sensing images.

Method: Propose Geo-DLC task, construct DE-Dataset with 25 categories and 261,806 instances, introduce DE-Benchmark evaluation suite, and develop DescribeEarth MLLM with scale-adaptive focal strategy and domain-guided fusion module using remote sensing vision-language model features.

Result: DescribeEarth model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark, demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical soundness across various remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Geo-DLC task, DE-Dataset, DE-Benchmark, and DescribeEarth model effectively address object-level fine-grained captioning in remote sensing, enabling better utilization of semantic information with released data, code and weights.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

TL;DR: A YOLO-based deep learning model using ConSinGAN for data augmentation achieves 91.3% accuracy in automated defect detection for metal sheets, with YOLOv9 performing best and being integrated into a practical AOI system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve time-consuming and labor-intensive defect detection tasks in industrial manufacturing through automated optical inspection.

Method: Used four YOLO versions (v3, v4, v7, v9) combined with ConSinGAN for data augmentation to address limited metal sheet image data, training on metal sheet defect images.

Result: YOLOv9 with ConSinGAN achieved the best performance with 91.3% accuracy and 146 ms detection time, outperforming other YOLO versions.

Conclusion: The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN successfully establishes a practical automated optical inspection system that can be easily applied to other industrial components.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes OmniDFA, a framework for AI-generated image detection and few-shot source attribution, addressing challenges in deepfake detection through open-set identification of unseen generators using limited samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods overfit specific forgery traits, while source attribution is limited by scarce well-categorized datasets. There's a need for robust attribution that works with limited samples in real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduces OmniDFA framework for both image authenticity assessment and few-shot source attribution. Also creates OmniFake dataset with 1.17M images from 45 generative models to support research.

Result: OmniDFA demonstrates excellent capability in open-set attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AI-generated image detection.

Conclusion: The proposed open-set, few-shot source identification paradigm and OmniDFA framework provide a practical solution for real-world AI-generated image detection and attribution, supported by the comprehensive OmniFake dataset.

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT is an active information-driven multimodal chain-of-thought framework that improves vision-language reasoning through reliable attention maps, proactive visual region selection, and dynamic attention-shifting triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal CoT methods rely on unreliable attention maps and passive selection strategies that fail to capture the model's cognitive needs for information during reasoning.

Method: AIMCoT introduces three components: Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG) for reliable attention maps, Active Visual Probing (AVP) for goal-oriented visual region selection using information theory, and Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT) for optimal visual information insertion timing.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks show that AIMCoT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings.

Conclusion: AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and human-like multimodal reasoning by actively foraging for information and dynamically structuring the reasoning process.

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [119] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models memorize training data due to early overestimation during denoising, where classifier-free guidance amplifies predictions and forces latent trajectories to converge toward memorized images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why and how diffusion models memorize training data, which raises privacy and copyright concerns, as prior work hasn't resolved the fundamental mechanisms behind memorization.

Method: Analyzed latent space dynamics in diffusion and denoising processes, examining training loss, classifier-free guidance effects, noise predictions, and decomposition of intermediate latents to understand memorization mechanisms.

Result: Found that memorization is driven by overestimation of training samples during early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and accelerates convergence toward memorized images. Training loss is larger under memorization, and deviations from theoretical denoising schedule correlate with memorization severity.

Conclusion: Early overestimation is identified as the central underlying mechanism of memorization in diffusion models, explaining how memorized prompts inject training images into noise predictions and force convergence toward paired samples.

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED is a multimodal medical vision-language model that uses probabilistic contrastive learning to handle many-to-many modality mappings in medical data, outperforming existing models in cross-modality retrieval and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision-language models fail to account for many-to-many mappings between different medical modalities (imaging, clinical text), which is essential for comprehensive medical decision-making.

Method: Uses probabilistic contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss and Hellinger distance to align four modalities (chest X-rays, ECG, echocardiograms, clinical text) into unified probabilistic embedding space, plus probabilistic synthetic sampling loss for intra-modality binding.

Result: Outperforms current Med-VLPMs across 13 medical datasets in cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification, with improved intra- and inter-modality binding for prognostication.

Conclusion: ProbMED successfully models many-to-many modality relationships in medical data through probabilistic embeddings, demonstrating superior performance in multimodal medical tasks.

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

TL;DR: MISP-DPO is a multimodal DPO framework that uses multiple semantically diverse negative images via Plackett-Luce model to address limitations of oversimplified pairwise comparisons in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal DPO methods rely on oversimplified pairwise comparisons with single negative images from basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture complex multimodal preferences and cause optimization bias and hallucinations.

Method: Embeds prompts and images in CLIP space, uses sparse autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors, selects negative samples based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation from positive, and mutual diversity, and adopts Plackett-Luce objective with importance sampling for efficiency.

Result: Experiments across five diverse benchmarks show MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in preference-based learning is validated, demonstrating broader and more informative supervision.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

TL;DR: SAGE introduces a unified training pipeline for Visual Place Recognition that jointly improves local feature aggregation, organizes samples during training, and performs hard sample mining through spatial-visual adaptive graph exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VPR methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies but neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training, limiting their ability to handle large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variations.

Method: SAGE uses a lightweight Soft Probing module to learn residual weights for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, reconstructs an online geo-visual graph fusing geographic proximity and visual similarity, and employs greedy weighted clique expansion sampling to focus learning on informative place neighborhoods. Implemented with frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmarks: 98.9% Recall@1 on SPED, 95.8% on Pitts30k-test, 94.5% on MSLS-val, and 96.0% on Nordland. Notably obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED using only 4096D global descriptors.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates that jointly optimizing spatial context and visual similarity through adaptive graph exploration significantly improves VPR performance, achieving superior results with efficient parameter usage and establishing new state-of-the-art across multiple challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo is a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer that enables fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing by quantizing landmarks into discrete tokens and using location-mapping positional encoding for flexible geometry-appearance interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models for instruction-based face editing struggle with precise attribute control and identity preservation, especially when conditional landmarks deviate significantly from the source due to large expression/pose changes or inaccurate landmark estimates.

Method: Proposes LaTo with three key innovations: (1) landmark tokenizer that quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial tokens, (2) location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens for unified processing, and (3) landmark predictor using vision-language models with structured chain-of-thought for accurate target landmark inference.

Result: LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. The authors also curated HFL-150K, the largest benchmark for this task with over 150K real face pairs.

Conclusion: LaTo provides an effective solution for fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing by treating landmarks as discrete tokens rather than rigid geometric constraints, enabling better handling of significant facial changes while maintaining identity.

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: To address challenges in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) under complex real-world scenarios including long-term object disappearances/reappearances and small/inconspicuous objects.

Method: Freeze SAM2 feature extractor during training, fine-tune remaining components, and use pixel-check strategy during inference to progressively refine predictions by combining multiple models.

Result: Achieved 86.37% J&F score on test set, ranking 1st in MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses VOS challenges in complex scenarios through confidence-guided fusion and robust feature preservation.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

*Donghwan Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel SO(3) diffusion model for human mesh recovery that generates pose probability distributions rather than single deterministic outputs, addressing the inherent ambiguity in 3D pose estimation from 2D images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HMR methods either produce single deterministic outputs that ignore ambiguity or probabilistic methods that trade off accuracy for diversity. Current probabilistic approaches don't match state-of-the-art deterministic models in single prediction performance.

Method: Uses SO(3) diffusion model to generate pose parameter distributions as 3D rotations, employs conditioning dropout for both unconditional and image-conditional generation, and uses transformer for hierarchical joint structure learning with MLP-based denoising.

Result: The model effectively predicts accurate pose probability distributions and addresses the accuracy-diversity trade-off in probabilistic HMR methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully models well-aligned distributions to 2D observations and provides a more comprehensive solution to the inherent ambiguity in 3D human pose recovery from single images.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

Motivation: Current drag-based image editing methods primarily operate on 2D pixel planes with limited 3D cues, resulting in imprecise and inconsistent edits, particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective transformations.

Method: Built upon a unified displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors, with a conflict-free partitioning strategy to isolate editing regions and prevent interference.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior precision, structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability across various editing scenarios.

Conclusion: GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a single forward pass by effectively incorporating 3D geometric guidance while resolving discontinuities and multi-point dragging conflicts.

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be

*Mingyang Li,Yimeng Fan,Changsong Liu,Tianyu Zhou,Xin Wang,Yanyan Liu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPDRecon is an image-plane decoding framework that reduces dependency on multi-view geometric constraints by exploiting rich spatial information within individual views, achieving superior reconstruction stability with minimal performance degradation when view count decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods rely heavily on multi-view pixel back-projection ray intersections, causing reconstruction quality to depend on input view density and perform poorly in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.

Method: Proposes IPDRecon with three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD), which collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images through physical imaging processes.

Result: On ScanNetV2, IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability with nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%, achieving coefficient of variation of 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%, and maximum performance drop of 0.42%.

Conclusion: Exploiting intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited scenarios in practical applications, effectively preserving spatial geometric features while enhancing view-invariant reconstruction.

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs evaluated for topic-aligned captioning in financial short-form videos using 7 modality combinations across 5 topics, revealing video alone performs well and too many modalities can introduce noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish baselines for financial short-form video captioning and understand the potential and challenges of grounding complex visual cues in this domain.

Method: Tested joint reasoning over transcripts, audio, and video using 624 annotated YouTube short-form videos across all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) on five topics.

Result: Video alone performs strongly on four of five topics, capturing visual context and effective cues like emotions and gestures. Selective pairs like TV or AV often outperform TAV, suggesting too many modalities may introduce noise.

Conclusion: Established first baselines for financial short-form video captioning, demonstrating video's strong performance and potential noise from excessive modalities.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON is a virtual try-on method that uses measurement-guided diffusion to preserve non-try-on regions while generating realistic garment try-on images, eliminating boundary artifacts through trajectory-aligned solvers and frequency-level correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods using latent diffusion models struggle to preserve identity and background in non-try-on regions, often causing boundary artifacts when directly replacing these areas with original content.

Method: Reformulates VITON as a linear inverse problem and uses trajectory-aligned solvers with residual prior-based initialization and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising.

Result: Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 show effective preservation of identity and background, elimination of boundary artifacts, and improved visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ART-VITON successfully addresses the challenge of preserving non-try-on regions in virtual try-on while generating realistic garment alignments through measurement-guided diffusion framework.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [131] [Free Lunch Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Preference Image Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25771)
*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text Preference Optimization (TPO) enables free-lunch alignment of text-to-image models without needing paired image preference data by training models to prefer matched prompts over mismatched ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods for text-to-image alignment require costly human annotations and paired image preference data, creating scalability limitations.

Method: TPO framework trains models to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts constructed by perturbing original captions using a large language model. Extends DPO and KTO to create TDPO and TKTO.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show TPO methods consistently outperform original counterparts with better human preference scores and improved text-to-image alignment.

Conclusion: TPO provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for text-to-image model alignment that doesn't rely on expensive human annotations.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

TL;DR: v-HUB is a visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' ability to comprehend humor from visual cues alone, using minimally verbal short videos from silent films and online resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, which has real-world applications like enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions.

Method: Created v-HUB benchmark with curated minimally verbal short videos paired with rich annotations (captions, descriptions, explanations), and evaluated diverse MLLMs including specialized Video-LLMs and versatile OmniLLMs with audio processing capabilities.

Result: MLLMs face significant difficulties in comprehending humor from visual cues alone, with marked performance drops on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation. Audio integration helps with humor understanding.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with visual humor comprehension, and incorporating audio shows promise for improving performance on complex video understanding tasks, highlighting the importance of richer modality integration.

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCPO addresses training instability in text-to-image model alignment by enforcing proportional credit assignment, leading to faster convergence and better image quality than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current policy gradient methods for text-to-image model alignment suffer from training instability and high variance due to disproportionate credit assignment in the generative sampler, which hampers convergence speed and image quality.

Method: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO) framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through stable objective reformulation and principled reweighting of timesteps.

Result: PCPO stabilizes training, accelerates convergence significantly, improves image quality by mitigating model collapse, and substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines including state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Conclusion: PCPO effectively addresses the core issue of disproportionate credit assignment in T2I model alignment, providing a more stable and efficient training framework that delivers superior performance across all metrics.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENM Inversion is a novel noise map inversion technique for text-guided image editing that improves both content preservation and editability by searching for optimal noise maps aligned with target prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous inversion methods for text-guided image editing struggle to adhere closely to target text prompts because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of source images, restrict editing flexibility needed for desired edits.

Method: The method analyzes noise map properties for enhanced editability and introduces editable noise refinement that minimizes the difference between reconstructed and edited noise maps to align with target edits.

Result: Extensive experiments show ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across various image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. The approach also successfully applies to video editing with temporal consistency.

Conclusion: ENM Inversion effectively addresses the limitation of previous inversion methods by providing optimal noise maps that balance content preservation with editability, enabling high-quality text-guided image and video editing.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

TL;DR: EvoQuality is a self-supervised framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously improve image quality assessment capabilities without ground-truth labels, using self-consistency and iterative evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving VLMs rely on costly human-annotated data, while self-supervised techniques for perceptual domains like image quality assessment remain unexplored.

Method: Adapts self-consistency to ranking-based IQA by generating pseudo-labels through pairwise majority voting on VLM outputs, then using fidelity reward with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for iterative evolution.

Result: Boosts base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks, achieving competitive or superior performance to supervised VLM-based IQA models on 5 out of 7 benchmarks.

Conclusion: EvoQuality demonstrates that VLMs can autonomously refine perceptual capabilities without human supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance through self-supervised iterative evolution.

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: EchoingECG is a probabilistic student-teacher model that uses ECG data to predict cardiac function measurements traditionally obtained from echocardiograms, outperforming state-of-the-art ECG models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECGs are low-cost and accessible, while echocardiograms require significant hospital resources but are crucial for cardiac assessment. The goal is to enable ECG-based prediction of ECHO measurements to improve accessibility.

Method: Uses a probabilistic student-teacher model combining Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++) with ECHO-CLIP vision-language model to distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO predictions. Variance estimation helps identify regions of uncertainty in ECGs.

Conclusion: EchoingECG successfully enables ECG-based prediction of cardiac function measurements, providing a more accessible alternative to echocardiograms while maintaining performance and offering uncertainty awareness.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

TL;DR: The Point-It-Out (PIO) benchmark evaluates VLMs' embodied reasoning through precise visual grounding across three stages: object localization, task-driven pointing, and visual trace prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate embodied reasoning through multiple-choice questions based on image annotations, lacking systematic assessment of precise visual grounding abilities.

Method: Proposed hierarchical evaluation protocol with three stages (S1: referred-object localization, S2: task-driven pointing, S3: visual trace prediction) using data from indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios.

Result: Experiments with 10+ VLMs show GPT-4o underperforms in precise visual grounding compared to some open-source models, while models like MoLMO excel in S1-S2 but struggle with S3's visual trace planning.

Conclusion: The PIO benchmark reveals limitations in current VLMs' embodied reasoning capabilities, particularly in precise visual grounding and combined grounding with visual trace planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DSGA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for adapting SAM to agricultural vision tasks with limited data, achieving superior segmentation performance on chickpea pods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models for agricultural computer vision is challenging due to limited training data and complex field conditions, requiring methods that work under extreme data constraints.

Method: Proposed Dynamic Similarity-based Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module with learnable polynomial decay-initialized weight ranking and adaptive local feature aggregation, combined with LoRA for complementary optimization of local and global dependencies.

Result: DSGA with LoRA achieved 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure compared to baseline SAM fine-tuning, with progressive performance gains across 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring, achieving accurate pod-counting with adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 under challenging field conditions with only 4.00M trainable parameters.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

TL;DR: Logo-VGR is a new method for open-world logo recognition that reformulates the task as comparison-based matching rather than direct brand classification, enabling generalization to unseen brands with minimal supervision.


<details>

Motivation: Existing multimodal models are primarily evaluated on general benchmarks but perform poorly in domain-specific scenarios like product moderation, where traditional logo recognition methods require memorizing thousands of brands and fail to generalize to unseen brands.

Method: Logo-VGR introduces domain-specific multimodal reasoning with two components: Logo Perception Grounding for injecting domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning to enhance reasoning capabilities. It reformulates logo recognition as a comparison task where models match product images with candidate logos.

Result: Experimental results show Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, demonstrating superior generalization to unseen brands.

Conclusion: Logo-VGR provides an effective paradigm for domain-specific multimodal reasoning that overcomes the limitations of memorization-based approaches and enables robust generalization in open-world logo recognition tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

*Christophe Botella,Benjamin Deneu,Diego Marcos,Maximilien Servajean,Theo Larcher,Cesar Leblanc,Joaquim Estopinan,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLifeCLEF 2023 was a machine learning competition for multi-label species classification using 5M plant observations and environmental data across Europe, revealing biases in single-positive-label training and effective hybrid learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance species distribution modeling using deep learning and remote sensing data by organizing an open competition, addressing the challenge of predicting species composition from environmental predictors.

Method: Used 5 million plant species observations with single positive labels, combined with high-resolution remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation, and coarse-resolution climate, soil, and human footprint data. Evaluated models on multi-label classification of 22,000 standardized survey plots.

Result: The competition revealed biases in methods trained with single positive labels when evaluated on multi-label tasks, but identified effective learning strategies that combine both single-label and multi-label data during training.

Conclusion: The GeoLifeCLEF 2023 competition successfully advanced species distribution modeling, highlighting important methodological challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid training approaches that address the single-positive-label bias in multi-label evaluation.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

*Kazuki Matsuda,Yuiga Wada,Shinnosuke Hirano,Seitaro Otsuki,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VELA is a new automatic evaluation metric for long image captions that outperforms existing methods and achieves superhuman performance on the LongCap-Arena benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are designed for short captions and are unsuitable for long captions. LLM-as-a-Judge approaches also suffer from slow inference due to autoregressive inference and early visual fusion.

Method: Proposed VELA metric within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework, and created LongCap-Arena benchmark with 7,805 images, reference captions, candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments across three perspectives.

Result: VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena benchmark.

Conclusion: VELA provides an effective automatic evaluation solution for long image captions, addressing limitations of existing methods through a novel hybrid framework and comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for reward-guided image editing using trajectory optimal control in diffusion models, achieving better reward-fidelity balance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward-guided approaches focus on generation but not editing, which requires preserving source image content while enhancing target rewards. This gap in image editing applications is largely unexplored.

Method: Formulates editing as trajectory optimal control problem, treating diffusion reverse process as controllable trajectory from source image, with iterative adjoint state updates to steer editing.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines across distinct editing tasks, achieving superior reward maximization and source image fidelity without reward hacking.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables training-free reward-guided image editing with optimal balance between reward enhancement and content preservation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

*Xinyu Tian,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Mengqi He,Fabian Waschkowski,Lukas Wesemann,Peter Tu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal reasoning in Vision-Language Models enhances logical inference but can impair perceptual grounding through visual forgetting. The paper proposes Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) to maintain visual grounding during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual nature of multimodal reasoning where enhanced logical inference comes at the cost of impaired perceptual grounding and visual forgetting.

Method: Proposes Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a method that explicitly steers reasoning toward visually grounded trajectories to prevent visual forgetting.

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B significantly strengthens visual information reliance and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: VAPO effectively addresses visual forgetting in multimodal reasoning, maintaining perceptual grounding while enhancing logical inference capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSLR is the first benchmark for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, testing VLMs' ability to deduce facts from multimodal inputs using formal logic. Current VLMs struggle significantly, with GPT-4.1 achieving only 46.8%. The proposed LogiCAM framework boosts performance by 14.13% by applying formal logical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning is critical for high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, where rigorous, deterministic reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. Current VLMs lack proper evaluation for such capabilities.

Method: Created MuSLR benchmark with 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations with reasoning depths from 2 to 9. Proposed LogiCAM framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs.

Result: 7 state-of-the-art VLMs all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with GPT-4.1 achieving only 46.8%. LogiCAM boosts GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, with larger gains on complex logics like first-order logic. Error analysis shows 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in multimodal symbolic logical reasoning. The LogiCAM framework demonstrates that applying formal logical rules can substantially improve performance, and the identified logical misalignment issues provide key insights for future model improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

*Po-Han Huang,Jeng-Lin Li,Po-Hsuan Huang,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchEAD is a unified patch-focused framework for training-free anomaly detection that works with diverse foundation models using visual prompting techniques, achieving superior performance without textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial anomaly detection relies on foundation models but focuses mainly on textual prompt tuning, leaving visual processing fragmented across different models. The goal is to create a unified visual framework that works with various foundation models.

Method: Proposes Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD) framework with visual prompting techniques including alignment module and foreground masking, enabling training-free anomaly detection compatible with multiple foundation models.

Result: Experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to prior work, despite not using textual features. The framework also provides insights on how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity robustness.

Conclusion: A well-unified patch-only framework enables quick, calibration-light deployment without needing carefully engineered textual prompts, making it practical for real-world visual inspection applications.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

*Pasindu Ranasinghe,Dibyayan Patra,Bikram Banerjee,Simit Raval*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hardware-agnostic method for generating colorized 360° point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple cameras, featuring robust low-light performance through integrated image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial understanding by fusing camera data with LiDAR measurements, particularly addressing the challenge of reliable operation under low-light conditions.

Method: Uses multiple camera inputs with automatic geometric transformation computation between LiDAR and cameras, integrated low-light image enhancement module, color correction for uniformity, and requires initial camera calibration without specialized targets.

Result: Achieved real-time performance and reliable colorization even under very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would otherwise remain undetectable using Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and four-camera configuration.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides robust 360° colorized point cloud generation with excellent low-light performance and streamlined setup process, demonstrating practical viability for real-world applications.

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

*Junjie Zhou,Wei Shao,Yagao Yue,Wei Mu,Peng Wan,Qi Zhu,Daoqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPLE is a hierarchical prompt learning framework for few-shot whole slide image classification that integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs predictions at both entity and slide levels using LLM-generated prompts and cross-scale graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for WSI classification rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis.

Method: Proposes MAPLE framework that: 1) Uses LLMs to generate entity-level and slide-level prompts, 2) Employs entity-guided cross-attention for entity-level features and alignment with subtype-specific attributes, 3) Develops cross-scale entity graph learning to enrich representations, 4) Aggregates refined representations for slide-level prediction, and 5) Combines entity-level and slide-level outputs.

Result: Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of the approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: MAPLE successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by capturing fine-grained entity-level phenotypic variations while maintaining slide-level diagnostic capabilities through hierarchical prompt learning and cross-scale representation refinement.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSketcher introduces a comprehensive suite for "thinking with images" paradigm in VLMs, featuring a 31k CoT dataset with tool calls and edited images, and a model that generates visual thoughts directly in embedding space without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the emerging "thinking with images" paradigm in VLMs by addressing limitations in data construction accuracy, structural design, and application scenarios for multimodal reasoning.

Method: Created a 31k chain-of-thought dataset with diverse tool calls and edited images, then designed a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning by directly generating "visual thoughts" in visual embedding space without external tools.

Result: Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance, validating both the dataset utility and model effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeepSketcher enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images" through its comprehensive dataset and native visual thought generation approach, advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first systematic study of Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogue safety, creates the MMDS dataset with 4,484 annotated samples, and develops LLaVAShield - a state-of-the-art tool for detecting and assessing safety risks in multimodal conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are moving into interactive, multi-turn use, creating new safety risks that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. Malicious intent can be spread across turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful content.

Method: Developed an automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe dialogues. Created the MMDS dataset with fine-grained safety ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales. Built LLaVAShield to jointly detect and assess risk in user inputs and assistant responses.

Result: LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. The MMDS dataset contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples.

Conclusion: The work presents the first systematic definition and study of MMT dialogue safety, provides a comprehensive dataset and framework for future research, and demonstrates superior performance of the proposed safety detection tool compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

TL;DR: VLM-FO1 transforms object perception from coordinate generation to feature retrieval using a Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder and token-based referencing, achieving SOTA performance without compromising general VLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization due to the challenge of generating exact numerical coordinates with language-centric architectures.

Method: Uses a plug-and-play module with Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (dual vision encoder) to generate region tokens rich in semantic and spatial detail, plus token-based referencing for LLM reasoning about visual regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in object grounding, region generation, and visual region reasoning.

Conclusion: Establishes an effective paradigm for perception-aware VLMs that bridges high-level reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding through two-stage training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

*Marco Zimmerli,Andreas Plesner,Till Aczel,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial robustness follows logarithmic scaling laws with data volume and model size, but data quality and training objectives are more crucial than raw scale alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite architectural and training advances, requiring investigation of how training data characteristics affect robustness.

Method: Evaluated 36 state-of-the-art vision models across supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning approaches trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images, using six black-box attack categories including random perturbations, geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and ImageNet-R style shifts.

Result: A tenfold increase in data reduces attack success rate by ~3.2%, while a tenfold increase in model size reduces ASR by ~13.4%. Self-supervised models on curated datasets like DINOv2 outperformed models on larger but less curated datasets. Adversarial fine-tuning improved generalization across structural variations but not color distributions.

Conclusion: While scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving broad-spectrum adversarial resilience, with persistent gaps between human and machine vision.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

### [153] [UniMMAD: Unified Multi-Modal and Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via MoE-Driven Feature Decompression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25934)
*Yuan Zhao,Youwei Pang,Lihe Zhang,Hanqi Liu,Jiaming Zuo,Huchuan Lu,Xiaoqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMAD is a unified framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection that uses Mixture-of-Experts-driven feature decompression to address limitations of existing fragmented approaches and shared decoding paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods treat modality and class as independent factors, leading to fragmented solutions, excessive memory overhead, and poor performance with large domain variations due to shared decoding paths causing distorted normality boundaries and high false alarm rates.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts-driven feature decompression with 'general to specific' paradigm. Multi-modal inputs are compressed into general features via encoder with feature compression module, then decompressed into modality/class-specific forms via sparsely-gated cross MoE that dynamically selects expert pathways. Includes grouped dynamic filtering and MoE-in-MoE structure for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities, and 66 classes, while reducing parameter usage by 75% while maintaining sparse activation and fast inference.

Conclusion: UniMMAD provides a unified and efficient solution for multi-modal multi-class anomaly detection that overcomes limitations of existing fragmented approaches through adaptive and disentangled reconstruction.

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

### [154] [CO3: Contrasting Concepts Compose Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25940)
*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CO3, a corrective sampling strategy to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models by steering away from regions where joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-concept prompts like "a cat and a dog" often fail in diffusion models, yielding images where one concept is missing, faint, or colliding awkwardly with another due to the model drifting into mixed modes that over-emphasize strongly learned single concepts.

Method: Introduces a plug-and-play corrective sampling strategy that steers diffusion sampling away from regions where joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept, aiming for "pure" joint modes where all concepts coexist with balanced visual presence.

Result: Experiments show improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness on diverse multi-concept prompts, with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods.

Conclusion: Lightweight corrective guidance can substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion systems without requiring model retraining or tuning.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

*Longzhen Yang,Zhangkai Ni,Ying Wen,Yihang Liu,Lianghua He,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SS-ACL is an annotation-free framework that generates clinically accurate medical reports by aligning text with anatomical regions using self-supervised learning and anatomical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require expensive expert annotations and suffer from pathology distribution bias across datasets, limiting generalizability and increasing costs.

Method: Uses hierarchical anatomical graph with top-down inclusion structure, recursive fine-grained region reconstruction, and region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency to align text with visual evidence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% in lexical accuracy and 25% in clinical efficacy, and surpasses leading visual foundation models by 8% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Conclusion: SS-ACL enables accurate, interpretable medical report generation without expert annotations, achieving superior performance while reducing labeling costs and improving generalizability.

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

*Espen Uri Høgstedt,Christian Schellewald,Annette Stahl,Rudolf Mester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flexible tracking framework using pose estimation for salmon welfare monitoring in aquaculture, addressing underwater challenges like occlusion and similar appearance/motion, outperforming state-of-the-art trackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CV methods for salmon welfare monitoring focus on single indicators separately, require high resources, and struggle with underwater challenges like occlusion, similar appearance, and motion.

Method: Uses pose estimation to extract bounding boxes and body parts, with specialized modules to handle underwater salmon scene challenges, then employs high-detail body part tracks for welfare indicator calculation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art pedestrian tracker BoostTrack on two salmon tracking challenges (ID transfers in crowded scenes and ID switches during turning), and demonstrates suitability for tail beat wavelength analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses underwater salmon tracking challenges and enables automated welfare monitoring through body part tracking, with datasets and code made available.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PinPoint3D is an interactive framework for fine-grained 3D part segmentation that generates precise part-level masks from few user clicks, addressing limitations in existing methods through a novel data synthesis pipeline and achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive segmentation methods are limited to coarse instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse real-world scans and lack annotated data for fine-grained 3D part segmentation needed for complex manipulation tasks.

Method: Developed PinPoint3D framework with a key component being a new 3D data synthesis pipeline that creates large-scale scene-level datasets with dense part annotations, enabling fine-grained multi-granularity segmentation from few user point clicks.

Result: Achieved average IoU of 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings, surpassing 71.3% IoU with few additional clicks. Outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16% improvement in IoU and precision on challenging sparse point clouds.

Conclusion: PinPoint3D represents a significant advancement towards more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments, effectively addressing the critical bottleneck of annotated data through innovative data synthesis.

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RH-Partial2Global improves VICL by using conformal prediction for reliable alternative sets and covering design for comprehensive pairwise preference sampling, outperforming Partial2Global.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICL methods rely on the similarity-priority assumption without sufficient justification, and Partial2Global's random sampling approach leads to incomplete coverage and redundant comparisons that harm global ranking quality.

Method: RH-Partial2Global uses jackknife conformal prediction to construct reliable alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments show RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a more reliable and holistic approach for selecting in-context examples in visual in-context learning.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

*Abdelilah Aitrouga,Youssef Hmamouche,Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRWKV-Editor is a novel video editing model that uses linear spatio-temporal aggregation with RWKV transformer to achieve linear complexity, enabling 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage while maintaining competitive editing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing models suffer from quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms, making them impractical for long-duration and high-resolution videos in real-time applications.

Method: Integrates linear spatio-temporal aggregation module using bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism from RWKV transformer into video-based diffusion models to capture global dependencies with linear complexity.

Result: Achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, while maintaining competitive frame consistency and text alignment. Performance gap widens with longer videos.

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor successfully addresses computational complexity limitations in video editing, enabling efficient processing of long videos without sacrificing quality, making it suitable for practical real-time applications.

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

*Nicola Messina,Rosario Leonardi,Luca Ciampi,Fabio Carrara,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Fabrizio Falchi,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly-supervised method for in-hand object segmentation using natural language narrations as supervision, achieving over 50% of fully supervised performance without pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level object recognition from egocentric images is valuable for applications like assistive technologies and activity monitoring, but progress is hindered by scarce annotated datasets and costly manual labeling.

Method: Proposes WISH (Weakly-Supervised In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations), an end-to-end model that distills knowledge from natural language narrations to learn hand-object associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at test time.

Result: Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show WISH surpasses all baselines based on open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, recovering more than 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods.

Conclusion: Narrations provide effective weak supervision for learning human-object interaction detection, enabling in-hand object segmentation without costly pixel-wise annotations while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgenticIQA is a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language models with traditional IQA tools to dynamically assess image quality through coordinated planning, execution, and summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IQA approaches use fixed models that limit adaptability to diverse distortions, user queries, and interpretability needs. They treat scoring and interpretation as separate processes despite their interdependence.

Method: Decomposes IQA into four subtasks: distortion detection, distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution, coordinated by planner, executor, and summarizer components. Uses vision-language models with traditional IQA tools in query-aware manner.

Result: Extensive experiments show AgenticIQA consistently surpasses strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment across diverse IQA datasets.

Conclusion: AgenticIQA provides an effective framework for dynamic, interpretable image quality assessment that integrates scoring and interpretation through modular agentic coordination.

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

TL;DR: PFDepth is the first pinhole-fisheye framework for heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation that exploits complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye cameras through a unified architecture with novel 3D Gaussian representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the complementary advantages of pinhole (undistorted, small FOV, far field) and fisheye (distorted, large FOV, near field) cameras for improved multi-view depth estimation in heterogeneous camera setups.

Method: Uses a unified architecture that lifts 2D features into canonical 3D volumetric space, employs Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion for distortion-aware feature fusion, and reformulates voxel fusion into 3D Gaussian representation with learnable latent Gaussian spheres that adapt to local textures.

Result: PFDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets, outperforming current mainstream depth networks.

Conclusion: This represents the first systematic study of heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, providing both technical innovation and valuable empirical insights for multi-view depth estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

*Rajendra K. Ray,Manish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fourth-order nonlinear PDE model combining diffusion and wave properties is proposed to suppress multiplicative noise while avoiding blocky artifacts common in second-order PDE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order PDE models for multiplicative noise suppression often introduce blocky artifacts in early denoising stages, motivating the development of a higher-order model.

Method: Proposed a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that integrates diffusion (guided by Laplacian and intensity values) and wave properties, with independent channel processing for color images.

Result: The model outperforms second-order anisotropic diffusion approaches on PSNR, MSSIM, and Speckle Index metrics for both grayscale and color images.

Conclusion: The fourth-order PDE model produces better denoising results than existing models while preserving fine details and textures.

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

*Yuqi Xiao,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR is a two-stage retrieval method for zero-shot composed image retrieval that uses intersection-driven coarse retrieval and LLM-based fine-grained re-ranking to overcome CLIP's limitations in feature fusion and semantic matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for zero-shot composed image retrieval suffer from indiscriminate feature fusion that carries irrelevant background details and lack fine-grained semantic matching capability due to global cosine similarity.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Coarse retrieval using intersection-driven strategy to retain only overlapping semantics between reference image and relative text, 2) Fine-grained re-ranking using adapted multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation for binary semantic relevance judgments.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO datasets, improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points.

Conclusion: Two-stage reasoning establishes a general paradigm for robust and portable zero-shot composed image retrieval.

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

### [165] [GeoLink: Empowering Remote Sensing Foundation Model with OpenStreetMap Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26016)
*Lubian Bai,Xiuyuan Zhang,Siqi Zhang,Zepeng Zhang,Haoyu Wang,Wei Qin,Shihong Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLink is a multimodal framework that integrates OpenStreetMap data with remote sensing foundation models to enhance geospatial intelligence through cross-modal pretraining and downstream task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a modality gap between remote sensing and OpenStreetMap data in terms of data structure, content, and spatial granularity, making effective synergy challenging. Most existing remote sensing foundation models focus only on imagery, missing the rich geographic context provided by OSM.

Method: GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using multi-granularity learning signals from OSM data with cross-modal spatial correlations. It introduces image mask-reconstruction for sparse input pretraining and generates both unimodal and multimodal fine-grained encodings for downstream tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances RS image encoder performance, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream tasks improves the model's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. Spatial correlation is found to be crucial for effective multimodal integration.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level geospatial artificial intelligence, with GeoLink providing an effective framework for integrating ground-level geospatial data with remote sensing foundation models.

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

*Shian Du,Menghan Xia,Chang Liu,Xintao Wang,Jing Wang,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchVSR adapts pre-trained video diffusion models for patch-wise video super-resolution using a dual-stream adapter and location-aware patch synthesis, enabling efficient 4K VSR from 512x512 base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video super-resolution methods using pre-trained models suffer from intensive full-attention computation and fixed output resolution limitations.

Method: Proposes PatchVSR with dual-stream adapter: patch branch for content fidelity and global branch for context features, plus location information injection and multi-patch joint modulation for consistency.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity, high-resolution patch-level detail synthesis and highly competitive 4K VSR with extreme efficiency.

Conclusion: The patch-based paradigm enables flexible and efficient video super-resolution while maintaining visual consistency across enhanced patches.

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

*Haoran Pei,Yuguang Yang,Kexin Liu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP) is a lightweight framework that improves out-of-distribution generalization by injecting spatially varying noise guided by causal masks from Vision Transformers, with stronger perturbations in background areas and weaker ones in foreground regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD generalization methods often overlook causal mechanisms while pursuing domain invariance through complex generative models or adversarial training, particularly problematic in biomedical images where distribution shifts are subtle and pervasive.

Method: Inject spatially varying Gaussian noise into input images using soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers, applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to foreground areas to encourage reliance on causally relevant features.

Result: Experimental results on the WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art OOD baselines.

Conclusion: Causal perturbation shows potential as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization in deep learning models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

### [168] [SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036)
*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge addresses CLIP's intra-modal misalignment in few-shot classification by mapping images to text modality while preserving semantics, outperforming existing methods especially in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's performance in few-shot classification is limited by intra-modal misalignment caused by modality gap and inter-modal training, making direct image comparisons unreliable.

Method: SeMoBridge uses a Semantic Modality Bridge to map images into text modality while preserving semantic content. It's closed-form and can be trained with multi-modal supervision combining image and text-alignment losses.

Result: SeMoBridge-T (trained version) requires minimal training time and outperforms other methods, particularly in 1, 2, and 4-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: SeMoBridge effectively addresses CLIP's intra-modal misalignment issue and provides superior few-shot classification performance with efficient training.

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends HAMMER with segmentation-guided scoring to detect global scene inconsistencies like foreground-background mismatches in manipulated images, improving detection without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER fails on global manipulations where main subjects are placed in implausible backgrounds due to label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground alignment.

Method: Proposes segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline using person/face segmentation masks to separate regions, extract embeddings with vision-language model, compute region-aware coherence scores, and fuse with HAMMER's predictions.

Result: SGS significantly enhances robustness to global manipulations, improves binary detection, grounding, and token-level explanations with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Demonstrates importance of region-aware reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection and provides open-source implementation for segmentation and scoring.

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper extends the DGM4 dataset with 5,000 new samples featuring foreground-background mismatches and hybrid text manipulations to address global inconsistencies in multimodal disinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets like DGM4 only cover local manipulations (face swaps, attribute edits, caption changes), leaving a critical gap for global inconsistencies like mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds that are prevalent in real-world forgeries.

Method: Used OpenAI's gpt-image-1 with carefully designed prompts to generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed into absurd/impossible backdrops. Created captions under three conditions (literal, text attribute, text split) yielding three manipulation categories: FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Implemented quality control pipelines for face visibility, deduplication, text scrubbing, and realistic headlines.

Result: Created DGM4+ dataset extension with 5,000 high-quality samples that introduce foreground-background mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations, complementing existing datasets to test detectors on both local and global reasoning.

Conclusion: The DGM4+ dataset addresses the gap in global manipulation detection and is intended to strengthen evaluation of multimodal models like HAMMER that struggle with FG-BG inconsistencies, with the dataset and generation script publicly released.

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

*Ioana Ciuclea,Giorgio Longari,Alice Barbara Tumpach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a geometric framework using principal fiber bundles to handle symmetries in classification tasks, avoiding data augmentation by measuring dissimilarities between orbits under symmetry groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build sustainable algorithms that account for symmetries in datasets without relying on data augmentation, which is commonly used in computer vision and medical applications.

Method: Uses the concept of sections of principal fiber bundles to mod out symmetries, allowing simple metrics to measure dissimilarities between orbits. Introduces a 2-parameter family of canonical curve parameterizations.

Result: Demonstrated the methodology on object contour datasets for translation, rotation, scaling, and reparameterization symmetries. Provides accessible code and tutorials for practical application.

Conclusion: The geometric framework provides an effective alternative to data augmentation for handling symmetries, with wide applicability potential across various domains.

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

*Seamie Hayes,Ganesh Sistu,Ciarán Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using foundation models (Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2) to generate 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels for self-supervised semantic occupancy prediction, reducing computational costs while achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised methods for semantic occupancy prediction use computationally expensive techniques like novel view synthesis, cross-view rendering, and depth estimation, which have high memory and computational requirements during training.

Method: Generate 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels using foundation models Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2, and use temporal information for label densification. Also propose EasyOcc model that learns solely from these pseudo-labels without complex rendering strategies.

Result: Substantial performance improvements: mIoU increased by 45% (from 9.73 to 14.09) when integrated into OccNeRF. EasyOcc achieves 13.86 mIoU and 7.71 mIoU on full scene evaluation, outperforming previous best by 31%.

Conclusion: Foundation models, temporal context, and loss computation space choice are critical for self-supervised learning in comprehensive scene understanding. The method is easily integrable into existing models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: Real-time multi-modal deep learning framework predicts penalty kick direction before ball contact using RGB frames and pose keypoints, achieving 89% accuracy with 22ms inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penalty kicks often decide championships, but goalkeepers have very limited time to anticipate kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues.

Method: Dual-branch architecture: MobileNetV2 CNN for RGB frames and LSTM with attention for 2D keypoints. Pose-derived keypoints guide visual focus. Distance-based thresholding segments input sequences before ball contact. Custom dataset of 755 penalty kicks with frame-level annotations.

Result: 89% accuracy on test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only baselines by 14-22%. Inference time of 22 milliseconds.

Conclusion: Lightweight and interpretable design suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-scene methods struggle with complex geometries, object transformations, and weak adherence to complex instructions, limiting their practical application for generating complete 3D environments from text.

Method: Integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical, functional, and contextual attributes, places objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning powered by large reasoning models.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to constraints, and asset retrieval quality across instructions ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates advanced spatial reasoning abilities of modern LRMs and contributes to text-to-scene generation; codebase released to advance research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVODiff introduces an information-theoretic perspective on diffusion model inference, showing that successful denoising reduces conditional entropy. It proposes an entropy-aware variance optimization method that outperforms state-of-the-art solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from slow inference and training-inference discrepancies. Existing gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency.

Method: Proposes EVODiff - an entropy-aware variance optimized method that systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising, based on insights that data prediction parameterization outperforms noise prediction and optimizing conditional variance minimizes transition/reconstruction errors.

Result: EVODiff significantly outperforms SOTA solvers: reduces reconstruction error by 45.5% (FID from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 NFE on CIFAR-10, cuts NFE cost by 25% (20 to 15 NFE) on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic perspective provides fundamental insights into diffusion model inference, and EVODiff demonstrates superior performance by systematically optimizing conditional entropy during denoising.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

*Ruixiao Dong,Zhendong Wang,Keli Liu,Li Li,Ying Chen,Kai Li,Daowen Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen is a pioneering feed-forward subject-driven generation framework built on Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models that resolves the trade-off between computational efficiency and generation quality through a dual-path injection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subject-driven generation methods present a stark trade-off: they either rely on computationally expensive per-subject fine-tuning (sacrificing efficiency and zero-shot capability) or use slow diffusion models. VAR models offer rapid sampling speeds and strong generative quality but are underexplored for this task.

Method: EchoGen employs a dual-path injection strategy that disentangles subject's high-level semantic identity from low-level fine-grained details. It uses a semantic encoder for abstract identity (injected via decoupled cross-attention) and a content encoder for visual details (integrated via multi-modal attention mechanism).

Result: EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling latency. Both quantitative and qualitative results substantiate the design effectiveness.

Conclusion: EchoGen is the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models, successfully bridging the gap between computational efficiency and generation quality in subject-driven creative AI tasks.

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

*Sachith Abeywickrama,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Xiaoli Li,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntroPE is a novel entropy-guided dynamic patch encoder for time series forecasting that improves temporal coherence by detecting natural transition points and dynamically placing patch boundaries, outperforming existing patch-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patch-based transformer approaches use temporally-agnostic patch construction that fractures temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries, disrupting short-term dependencies and weakening representation learning.

Method: EntroPE consists of two modules: Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that uses information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.

Result: Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided dynamic patching establishes a promising new paradigm for time series modeling that preserves temporal structure while retaining computational benefits.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Result: Achieved superior robustness on FishEye8K object detection benchmark, surpassing both naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable framework for automated edge-case synthesis, shifting data curation from manual effort to targeted automation for more reliable AI systems.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable
and continuously improving AI systems. Code is available at

*Yuansen Liu,Haiming Tang,Jinlong Peng,Jiangning Zhang,Xiaozhong Ji,Qingdong He,Donghao Luo,Zhenye Gan,Junwei Zhu,Yunhang Shen,Chaoyou Fu,Chengjie Wang,Xiaobin Hu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-MME is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on human-centric scene understanding, featuring diverse human scenes, progressive evaluation dimensions, and high-quality annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive evaluation for human-centric scene understanding due to absence of benchmarks that consider both granular human-oriented perception and higher-dimensional causal reasoning.

Method: Created Human-MME benchmark with 4 primary visual domains, 15 secondary domains, and 43 sub-fields. Includes 19,945 real-world image question pairs across 8 progressive evaluation dimensions with automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform.

Result: Extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively exposed limitations in human-centric image understanding and provided guidance for future research.

Conclusion: Human-MME enables more holistic evaluation of MLLMs for human-centric scene understanding and helps guide future development toward better human-centric image comprehension.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates fairness in pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, examining how pedestrian pose variations and joint occlusions affect detection performance across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While pedestrian detection focuses on reducing miss-rates and handling challenges like occlusion, fairness remains an underexplored concern in autonomous driving safety.

Method: Evaluated five pedestrian-specific detectors and three general-purpose models on ECP-DP dataset, quantifying fairness using Equal Opportunity Difference metric and applying Z-test for statistical significance.

Result: Found biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views. Lower body joint occlusion has more negative impact than upper body/head occlusion. Cascade R-CNN achieved lowest miss-rate and smallest bias.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, revealing significant biases that need addressing.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen is a novel framework for automated fine-grained multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, particularly for cell microscopy, achieving 94.62% accuracy using a dual-model architecture combining CNN and Vision Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-attribute classification in cell microscopy remains underrepresented compared to traditional cell type categorization, and conventional human annotation is time-consuming and costly.

Method: Dual-model architecture combining CNN for cell type classification and Vision Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification, using PBC dataset (8 cell types) and WBCAtt dataset (11 morphological attributes).

Result: Achieved new benchmark of 94.62% accuracy in multi-attribute classification, significantly enhancing model interpretability and offering substantial time and cost efficiency over human annotation.

Conclusion: AttriGen establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute labels.

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TSV360 dataset and TSalV360 method for text-driven saliency detection in 360-degree videos, leveraging vision-language models to enable customized saliency detection based on user text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the task of text-driven saliency detection in 360-degree videos, enabling customized detection of specific objects/events based on user-provided text descriptions rather than generic visual saliency.

Method: Extended a SOTA visual-based 360-degree video saliency detection approach by developing TSalV360 method that uses vision-language models for representation, similarity estimation, and viewport spatio-temporal cross-attention to discover dependencies between visual and textual modalities.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the TSV360 dataset showed TSalV360's competitiveness compared to SOTA visual-based approaches and demonstrated its ability to perform customized text-driven saliency detection effectively.

Conclusion: TSalV360 successfully enables text-driven saliency detection in 360-degree videos, providing a customizable approach that can detect specific objects/events based on user text descriptions while maintaining competitive performance with visual-only methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

*Chenyang Jiang,Zhengcen Li,Hang Zhao,Qiben Shan,Shaocong Wu,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSDD proposes a sparse 2D Gaussian representation for dataset distillation that replaces dense pixel-level representations with fewer Gaussian primitives, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and storage burdens of modern model training by creating compact datasets, overcoming redundancy in conventional dense pixel-level representations.

Method: Uses 2D Gaussian primitives to encode critical discriminative information sparsely, adapts CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling efficient rendering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets with high efficiency in encoding and decoding.

Conclusion: GSDD is an effective, scalable method that broadly applies to different distillation pipelines while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Experimental study on generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization outcomes using Large Multimodal Models and evaluating plausibility through semantic overlap between visual explanations and video summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for explainable AI in video summarization by generating natural language explanations that align with human reasoning and expectations.

Method: Extended existing framework by integrating LLaVA-OneVision model to produce textual descriptions of visual explanations, then evaluated plausibility using semantic overlap metrics (SBERT, SimCSE) between explanation descriptions and video summary descriptions.

Result: Conducted experimental study using CA-SUM method on SumMe and TVSum datasets to examine relationship between explanation faithfulness and plausibility, and identify best approaches for generating plausible textual explanations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization and examines the correlation between explanation faithfulness and plausibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGCE is a novel framework for Generalized Category Discovery that addresses limitations in existing methods by exploiting multi-granularity visual concepts and automatically estimating category numbers without prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD approaches fail to leverage multi-granularity conceptual information and assume known category numbers, which limits their practical applicability in real-world open-world scenarios.

Method: MGCE consists of two modules: Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL) for concept mining and dual-level representation learning, and Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL) that introduces multiple experts at different granularities with concept alignment for cross-expert collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, with MGCE achieving 3.6% average improvement over parametric approaches even without knowing exact category numbers, particularly excelling in novel-class accuracy.

Conclusion: MGCE effectively addresses key challenges in GCD by adaptively mining multi-granularity concepts and automatically estimating category numbers, making it suitable for practical open-world applications.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

*Jiayi Guo,Chuanhao Yan,Xingqian Xu,Yulin Wang,Kai Wang,Gao Huang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMG is a re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that uses MLLMs to identify misalignments and an Implicit Aligner to manipulate diffusion features for better image-prompt alignment without extra data or editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal alignment in diffusion models have limitations: finetuning requires scarce high-quality preference data, while editing methods may degrade overall image quality.

Method: Uses MLLM to detect misalignments, Implicit Aligner to manipulate diffusion conditioning features, and Iteratively Updated Preference Objective to guide re-generation without extra data.

Result: Extensive evaluations show IMG outperforms existing alignment methods on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX models, and works as a plug-and-play adapter to enhance prior methods.

Conclusion: IMG provides an effective data-free solution for multimodal alignment that improves image-prompt correspondence while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

TL;DR: Donut-MINT is a compressed version of Donut model for document VQA that uses mechanistic interpretability to guide knowledge distillation, reducing inference time and memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models like Donut are effective but too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications, requiring model compression.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation with mechanistic interpretability to analyze internal computations, identify essential subcomponents to retain, and determine which to approximate, skip, or reparametrize.

Result: Developed Donut-MINT, a pruned Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining strong performance on DocVQA benchmark.

Conclusion: Reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

TL;DR: Farsighted-LAM improves latent action models with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, addressing spatial and temporal perception limitations in VLA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LAMs suffer from poor spatial understanding due to end-to-end trained image encoders and limited temporal perception when input frames are distant, hindering stable action modeling.

Method: Proposed Farsighted-LAM with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, plus SSM-VLA framework integrating structured perception with visual Chain-of-Thought for explicit environmental reasoning.

Result: SSM-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: Combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning effectively enhances robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRPO, a reinforcement learning method that improves deepfake detection by aligning LLM reasoning with visual evidence at paragraph level, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs perform poorly on deepfake detection, producing misaligned explanations and hallucinations due to lack of visual grounding, while dataset scarcity constrains progress.

Method: Proposed Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at paragraph level, using a reasoning-annotated dataset.

Result: PRPO improves detection accuracy significantly and achieves highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0, outperforming GRPO in test-time conditions.

Conclusion: Grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence is crucial for reliable and interpretable deepfake detection, with PRPO demonstrating effective alignment between reasoning and visual content.

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

*Ali Zoljodi,Radu Timofte,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT) for low-bit Post-Training Quantization, using cluster-specific parameters to align quantized outputs with full-precision counterparts without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plain affine transformation worsens results in low-bit PTQ by applying uniform parameters to all outputs, leading to accuracy degradation in 2-bit quantization scenarios.

Method: Developed CAT framework that employs cluster-specific affine parameters to refine low-bit quantized outputs, requiring only negligible additional parameters and no model fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18 on ImageNet-1K, consistently outperforming prior PTQ methods across architectures and enhancing existing baselines by over 3% as a plug-in.

Conclusion: CAT effectively addresses accuracy degradation in low-bit PTQ through cluster-specific affine transformation, providing significant improvements without requiring model retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing skill proficiency estimation methods use black-box video classifiers that ignore multi-view context and lack explainability, limiting their practical utility.

Method: ProfVLM uses an AttentiveGatedProjector to dynamically fuse multi-view features from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback generation, treating skill assessment as generative reasoning.

Conclusion: Generative vision-language modeling represents a powerful new direction for skill assessment, offering both accurate predictions and transparent reasoning through natural language feedback.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3 is a weakly-supervised oriented object detection method that uses point annotations to address inefficient pseudo label utilization and poor quality issues through progressive label assignment and prior-guided dynamic mask loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing point-supervised methods which suffer from inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels, and to provide a cost-effective alternative to manual labeling for oriented object detection.

Method: Uses Progressive Label Assignment (PLA) that dynamically estimates instance sizes at different training stages, and Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss) that combines SAM model advantages with watershed algorithm to handle both sparse and dense scenes effectively.

Result: Achieves competitive performance: 66.09% on DOTA-v1.0, 56.86% on DOTA-v1.5, 41.28% on DOTA-v2.0, 46.40% on DIOR, 19.60% on STAR, and 45.96% on RSAR datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with large object size variations or sparse object occurrences.

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to use dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment and successfully integrates SAM model with watershed algorithm, achieving excellent performance across various datasets and scenarios.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

*Mehrsa Pourya,Bassam El Rawas,Michael Unser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flower is a solver for inverse problems that uses pre-trained flow models to produce reconstructions consistent with measurements through an iterative three-step process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified approach that bridges plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers while achieving high-quality reconstructions across various inverse problems.

Method: Iterative three-step procedure: (1) flow-consistent destination estimation using velocity network, (2) refinement via projection onto feasible set defined by forward operator, (3) time-progression step re-projecting along flow trajectory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

Conclusion: Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, unifying perspectives from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers, and demonstrates practical effectiveness with consistent performance across different problems.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continuous space-time video super-resolution method using 3D Video Fourier Field representation that enables flexible sampling, captures spatial detail and temporal dynamics, and provides aliasing-free reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional approaches that decouple spatial and temporal components and rely on brittle explicit frame warping for motion compensation.

Method: Encode video as continuous 3D Video Fourier Field with neural encoder predicting Fourier-like sinusoidal basis coefficients conditioned on low-resolution input.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, delivering sharper and more temporally consistent reconstructions across wide range of upscaling factors while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Joint modeling with continuous spatio-temporal representation substantially improves both spatial and temporal super-resolution performance.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

### [195] [SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330)
*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE is a training-free zero-shot composed image retrieval framework that uses MLLMs in two stages: semantic query augmentation and efficient batch reranking to better capture user intent without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free zero-shot CIR approaches are desirable but struggle to accurately capture user intent when incorporating textual modifications to reference images.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) enriches CLIP embeddings with MLLM-generated target captions for better intent capture; 2) Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) uses MLLM to perform joint visual-semantic reasoning on top candidates presented as an image grid.

Result: SQUARE delivers strong performance on four standard CIR benchmarks and maintains high performance even with lightweight pre-trained models.

Conclusion: SQUARE provides an effective and simple training-free solution for zero-shot composed image retrieval that better captures user intent through MLLM-enhanced semantic guidance and reasoning.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG) to localize key time intervals in long videos based on task descriptions, presents a benchmark (ToTG Bench), and proposes TimeScope framework with progressive reasoning that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks, but traditional approaches have limited generalizability and difficulty handling long videos.

Method: Proposed TimeScope framework with progressive reasoning: first identifies coarse-grained temporal scope, then refines through fine-grained moment partitioning. Also curated ToTG Pile dataset to enhance progressive temporal grounding.

Result: Extensive experiments show TimeScope consistently outperforms existing temporal-grounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings.

Conclusion: TimeScope is effective in addressing the challenging ToTG problem, highlighting its superiority over existing approaches for temporal grounding in long videos.

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR is the first test-time scaling framework for next-token prediction autoregressive image generation that uses token entropy without early decoding or external rewards, achieving significant performance improvements and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling approaches for visual autoregressive models rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, which are unsuitable for next-token prediction-based image generation due to incomplete intermediate results.

Method: ScalingAR uses token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation with two scaling levels: Profile Level (streams calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals) and Policy Level (adaptively terminates low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedules guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength).

Result: Improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and mitigates performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: ScalingAR successfully bridges the gap in test-time scaling for next-token prediction autoregressive image generation, demonstrating significant performance improvements, efficiency gains, and enhanced robustness without requiring early decoding or auxiliary rewards.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA is a generalist video anomaly detection system using MLLMs that automatically handles any scene and anomaly types without training data or manual adjustments, achieving state-of-the-art performance through agentic AI engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VAD methods require domain-specific training data and manual adjustments for new scenarios, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. The goal is to create a system that can automatically handle any scene and anomaly types without training or human involvement.

Method: PANDA uses MLLMs with four key capabilities: self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning with RAG mechanism, goal-driven heuristic reasoning with latent anomaly-guided prompts, tool-augmented self-reflection with progressive refinement, and self-improving chain-of-memory for leveraging historical experiences.

Result: Extensive experiments show PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

Conclusion: PANDA successfully demonstrates a generalist approach to video anomaly detection that eliminates the need for domain-specific training and manual adjustments, providing a robust and scalable solution for diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

TL;DR: MotionRAG is a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances video generation realism by adapting motion priors from reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA), achieving improved motion realism with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-to-video generation struggles with realistic motion due to the complexity of modeling physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that don't generalize well across diverse scenarios.

Method: Proposes MotionRAG with three key innovations: (1) retrieval-based pipeline extracting motion features using video encoder and resamplers, (2) in-context learning for motion adaptation via causal transformer, (3) attention-based motion injection adapter that integrates motion features into pretrained video diffusion models.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements across multiple domains and base models with negligible computational overhead during inference. Modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by updating retrieval database without retraining.

Conclusion: The research enhances video generation systems by enabling effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating synthesis of realistic motion dynamics with practical deployment advantages.

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes difficulty-aware evaluation for super-resolution models using high-frequency and rotation-invariant edge indices to better differentiate models that produce visually different results despite similar average scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current average score evaluation fails to reflect model performance on images of varying difficulty and doesn't capture artifacts on difficult images, making it hard to differentiate models with close average performance.

Method: Two image-difficulty measures: high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index to predict test images where models yield significantly different visual results, plus an evaluation method to reflect these differences in objective measures.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation methodology.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware performance evaluation better differentiates SISR models by accounting for varying image difficulty and visual differences not captured by average scores.

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: PRISM is a progressive three-stage framework for image deraining that combines multi-scale feature aggregation with hybrid attention and state-space modeling to remove rain streaks while preserving image details and global consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-scale image deraining models struggle with fine-grained recovery and global consistency, which is critical for applications like autonomous driving where clear vision is essential.

Method: Progressive three-stage framework: 1) Coarse Extraction Network (CENet) with Hybrid Attention UNet, 2) Frequency Fusion Network (SFNet) with Hybrid Domain Mamba for spatial and wavelet domain modeling, 3) Refine Network (RNet) for fine-grained structure recovery using original-resolution subnetwork.

Result: The method achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining methods, learning high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details and maintaining global context.

Conclusion: PRISM effectively addresses the limitations of single-scale deraining models through progressive processing and hybrid domain modeling, leading to improved image quality for critical vision tasks.

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuaRTZ enables 4-bit quantization for diffusion models by combining 8-bit outlier handling with leading-zero suppression to preserve texture details, achieving better performance than methods requiring FP16 branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational requirements that limit deployment, and while 8-bit quantization works well, extending to 4 bits is challenging due to amplified rounding errors that destroy fine-grained textures.

Method: Proposes QuaRTZ (Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression) - applies 8-bit min-max quantization for outliers and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero suppression to retain least significant bits (LSBs).

Result: Achieves FID of 6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell with 4-bit quantization, outperforming SVDQuant which requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Conclusion: QuaRTZ provides an effective 4-bit PTQ solution for diffusion models by balancing outlier preservation and LSB precision, demonstrating generalizability across activation distributions.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Motivation: Ensuring every vehicle meets variant specifications and is defect-free is increasingly complex in modern production lines, requiring automated inspection systems.

Method: Uses 11 synchronized cameras for 360° coverage, specialized deep learning modules (YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for OCR, YOLOv8-Seg for segmentation), view-aware fusion, and VIN-conditioned rule engine for comparison against expected manifest.

Result: Achieves 93% verification accuracy, 86% defect-detection recall, and sustains 3.3 vehicles/min, significantly outperforming single-view or no segmentation baselines.

Conclusion: First publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with defect detection in a deployable automotive industry setting, providing real-time interpretable pass/fail reports in ~300ms.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos is a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style transfer that works on unposed content from single images or multi-view collections, conditioned on style reference images, without requiring per-scene optimization or precomputed poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable geometry-aware, view-consistent 3D style transfer that generalizes to unseen categories, scenes, and styles, while eliminating the need for per-scene optimization and precomputed poses.

Method: Uses a Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions with self-attention for geometric fidelity, and style injection via global cross-attention for visual consistency. Incorporates a voxel-based 3D style loss to align aggregated scene features with style statistics.

Result: Experiments show Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, demonstrating effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the 3D style loss, and scalability from single view to large-scale multi-view settings.

Conclusion: Stylos successfully achieves view-consistent 3D stylization while preserving geometry, highlighting the framework's effectiveness and scalability across different input scenarios.

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view

TL;DR: ASGRA is a novel framework for indoor scene classification and sensitive content analysis that uses Scene Graphs and Graph Attention Networks instead of raw pixels, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing explainability and privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scene classification is challenging due to complex object relationships and spatial layouts, with applications ranging from robotics to sensitive content analysis like child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification.

Method: Proposes ASGRA framework that converts images into Scene Graphs and uses Graph Attention Networks for inference, directly modeling interactions between scene components through structured graph representations.

Result: Achieves 81.27% balanced accuracy on Places8 dataset (surpassing image-based methods) and 74.27% balanced accuracy in real-world CSAI evaluation with law enforcement.

Conclusion: Structured scene representations using Scene Graphs and Graph Attention Networks establish a robust paradigm for indoor scene classification and CSAI classification, offering explainability and privacy benefits.

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

### [207] [CBAM Integrated Attention Driven Model For Betel Leaf Diseases Classification With Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26484)
*Sumaiya Tabassum,Md. Faysal Ahamed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CBAM-CNN model with only 2.13M parameters achieves 95.58% accuracy for betel leaf disease classification, outperforming traditional pre-trained CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Betel leaf diseases threaten crop security and are difficult to identify in time. AI can help increase output by predicting diseases early.

Method: Proposed a lightweight CNN with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) that adaptively focuses on spatial and channel-wise features. Used enriched dataset of 10,185 images across three classes (Healthy, Leaf Rot, Leaf Spot).

Result: Achieved 97% precision, 94% recall, 95% F1 score, and 95.58% accuracy on test set. Model performance was visualized using Grad-CAM for explainability.

Conclusion: The lightweight CBAM-CNN model effectively classifies betel leaf diseases with high accuracy and interpretability, providing a practical solution for agricultural disease detection.

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoGuide reconstructs floorplans from movement trajectories using a diffusion-based posterior sampler with contrastive learning in an embedding space to handle the non-differentiable forward operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct inversion of floorplans from movement trajectories is ill-posed since many layouts can explain the same movements. The path-planning process is non-invertible and non-differentiable, causing optimization instability.

Method: Uses diffusion-based posterior sampling with a contrastive loss to create an embedding space where compatible floorplans and trajectories are close. Reformulates likelihood score in this smoother embedding space as a valid approximation.

Result: CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The embedding-based likelihood approximation enables effective posterior sampling for floorplan reconstruction from movement data, overcoming challenges of non-differentiable forward operators.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

TL;DR: A systematic post-training pipeline enhances small language models for edge deployment through curriculum-based SFT and offline knowledge distillation, achieving SOTA performance among billion-parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are too computationally expensive for edge environments, creating a need for efficient small models that can perform complex tasks under hardware constraints.

Method: A post-training pipeline with curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge distillation to enhance small model accuracy.

Result: The instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art performance among billion-parameter models with strong generalization under hardware constraints and competitive accuracy across tasks.

Conclusion: This provides a practical and efficient solution for developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++ is a robust depth completion framework that enhances depth maps from noisy direct Time-of-Flight (dToF) sensors using RGB guidance, addressing real-world calibration errors and anomalies through simulation training, anomaly detection, and specialized network design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth enhancement methods assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect alignment, overlooking real-world calibration errors and anomalies, which limits their practical applicability in high-precision tasks like 3D reconstruction and SLAM.

Method: Three key components: 1) Simulation method using synthetic datasets for robust training, 2) Learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection to remove erroneous dToF measurements, 3) Depth completion network integrating RGB images and monocular depth estimation priors for challenging regions.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 22% RMSE and 11% Rel improvement on ZJU-L5 dataset, 37% improvement in mirror regions on Mirror3D-NYU dataset, and 22% average gain on Hammer dataset using low-cost dToF data, enabling low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.

Conclusion: The proposed DEPTHOR++ framework demonstrates significant improvements in depth completion robustness and performance across diverse real-world scenarios, validating its effectiveness and generalizability for practical depth enhancement applications.

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: Stable Cinemetrics (SCINE) introduces a structured evaluation framework with four hierarchical taxonomies (Setup, Event, Lighting, Camera) for professional video generation, enabling fine-grained assessment of 76 control nodes through automated pipelines and expert human studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models and benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video production, lacking structured evaluation methods aligned with filmmaking practices.

Method: Developed four disentangled taxonomies (Setup, Event, Lighting, Camera) with 76 control nodes, created benchmark prompts for professional use cases, built automated categorization pipeline, conducted large-scale human study with 80+ film professionals evaluating 10+ models across 20K videos.

Result: Current models show significant gaps in Events and Camera-related controls. Trained an automatic evaluator (vision-language model) that outperforms zero-shot baselines and aligns with expert annotations.

Conclusion: SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video generation within video generative models, providing structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research in cinematic controls.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

TL;DR: Machine learning model using ground-truth data to automate proofreading in EM connectomics, reducing manual effort by 80% while achieving 90% of workflow value and automatically merging 200k fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual proofreading is the bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics for larger reconstructions and comparative studies, requiring significant human effort.

Method: Using available ground-truth data from manual annotation to train machine learning models for automating proofreading workflows and merging segmentation fragments.

Result: Achieved 80% cost reduction while maintaining 90% workflow value; automatically attached 200k fragments (equivalent to 4 proofreader years), increasing connectivity completion by 1.3%.

Conclusion: Machine learning can significantly reduce manual proofreading effort in EM connectomics while maintaining high quality, enabling scaling of connectome reconstructions.

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

*Yiyang Wang,Xi Chen,Xiaogang Xu,Yu Liu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffCamera enables flexible image refocusing using a diffusion transformer framework, overcoming data limitations through simulation and a novel stacking constraint for precise depth-of-field manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field effects are fixed after image creation, making it problematic when the applied blur is undesirable (e.g., subject out of focus). There's a need for flexible refocusing capabilities.

Method: Uses diffusion transformer framework with simulation-based pipeline for training data generation. Introduces stacking constraint based on photographic principle that different focus plane images can be linearly blended into multi-focus images.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across wide range of scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography and generative AI applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables flexible image refocusing with precise DoF manipulation, addressing the limitation of fixed depth-of-field effects in created images.

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: Existing multimodal audio generation models lack precise user control for professional Foley workflows, often generating unnecessary background sounds or focusing on wrong objects.

Method: SAGANet leverages visual segmentation masks along with video and textual cues for controllable audio generation, and introduces Segmented Music Solos benchmark dataset.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods and sets new standards for controllable, high-fidelity Foley synthesis.

Conclusion: SAGANet enables fine-grained, visually localized control over audio generation, addressing limitations in existing multimodal audio generation models.

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression classification is challenging due to high dimensionality and complexity of facial image data, requiring better feature extraction and dimensionality reduction approaches.

Method: Hybrid feature extraction combining VGG19 deep features with handcrafted SIFT and ORB descriptors, followed by K-means clustering and UMAP dimensionality reduction.

Result: Achieved 83.3% classification accuracy on facial expression recognition dataset, with UMAP identified as the most effective dimensionality reduction technique.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction is crucial not just as preprocessing but as an essential component for improving feature quality and classification performance in facial expression recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA² is a zero-shot generalizable panoramic depth estimator that addresses data scarcity and spherical distortion challenges through large-scale data curation and a novel SphereViT architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 38% improvement on AbsRel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic depth estimation faces challenges due to limited panoramic data leading to poor zero-shot generalization, and spherical distortions that require inefficient perspective splitting approaches like cubemaps.

Method: Proposed DA² with two key components: (1) data curation engine generating ~543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs from perspective data, totaling ~607K samples; (2) SphereViT that explicitly uses spherical coordinates to enforce geometric consistency in panoramic features.

Result: Achieves SoTA performance with 38% average improvement on AbsRel over strongest zero-shot baseline, outperforms prior in-domain methods, and shows higher efficiency than fusion-based approaches as an end-to-end solution.

Conclusion: DA² provides an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimation solution that effectively addresses data scarcity and spherical distortion challenges through large-scale data curation and spherical geometry-aware modeling.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HART is a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction that outputs watertight clothed meshes, aligned SMPL-X body meshes, and Gaussian-splat representations for photorealistic rendering from a small set of uncalibrated RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods either optimize parametric templates (overlooking loose garments and interactions) or train implicit functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences, then uses occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to recover complete geometry. Aligns with SMPL-X body model and initializes Gaussian splats for rendering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art: 18-23% Chamfer Distance improvement for clothed-mesh reconstruction, 6-27% PA-V2V drop for SMPL-X estimation, 15-27% LPIPS decrease for novel-view synthesis across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Feed-forward transformers can serve as scalable models for robust human reconstruction in real-world settings.

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: Current 3D shape completion methods rely on pre-aligned scans, which leak pose and scale cues that networks exploit to memorize positions rather than infer intrinsic geometry. This causes performance collapse when alignment is absent in real data.

Method: Proposes a SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network with modular layers that successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Uses a de-biased evaluation protocol to remove hidden cues.

Result: Outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on PCN benchmark. Sets new cross-domain records: lowers minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance on OmniObject3D by 14%. Even under stricter protocol, outperforms competitors under their biased settings.

Conclusion: Full SIM(3) equivariance is established as an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion, enabling robust performance across different domains without relying on pose and scale cues.

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

*Anusha Krishnan,Shaohui Liu,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Oscar Gentilhomme,David Caruso,Maurizio Monge,Richard Newcombe,Jakob Engel,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data, featuring metric, centimeter-accurate ground truth poses obtained through surveying tools, designed to address challenges in wearable device SLAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLAM benchmarks don't reflect the specific challenges of egocentric data from wearable devices, such as diverse motions, dynamic content, and long sessions with time-varying sensor calibration, and lack sufficiently accurate ground truth.

Method: Recorded hours of trajectories through a city center using glasses-like devices with various sensors, leveraging surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric and centimeter-accurate at city scale.

Result: State-of-the-art academic SLAM systems are not robust to the challenges presented by egocentric data, and the authors identified specific components responsible for this lack of robustness.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and benchmark enable evaluation of SLAM systems under realistic egocentric conditions, with different difficulty levels to support in-depth analysis of less mature approaches.

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext is a novel approach that bridges vision-language models and diffusion models using multimodal context tokens, separating generative reasoning from high-fidelity synthesis to improve text-to-image generation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models entangle multimodal generative reasoning (instruction understanding, grounding, image referring) with high-fidelity synthesis, limiting their effectiveness. The authors aim to decouple these capabilities.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: 1) Connect VLM to lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens, 2) Scale to large pre-trained diffusion model, 3) Add low-level image encoder for improved fidelity and instruction tuning. Uses comprehensive data pipeline with real, synthetic, and open-source datasets.

Result: The approach matches strong unified baselines and outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in several cases across image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition.

Conclusion: Query-Kontext successfully decouples multimodal generative reasoning from visual synthesis, enabling more effective text-to-image generation and editing while maintaining high quality.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch is a training-free method that enhances spatial relationship accuracy in text-to-image generation by using automatically-generated bounding boxes to isolate and stitch individual objects within Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models struggle with accurately capturing spatial relationships like 'above' or 'to the right of', and previous position control methods are incompatible with modern architectures that focus on image quality.

Method: Stitch automatically generates bounding boxes, isolates individual objects mid-generation using targeted attention heads, and seamlessly stitches them together without requiring full image completion or additional training.

Result: Stitch significantly improves spatial accuracy, enhancing FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54% improvement over previous models on PosEval.

Conclusion: Stitch successfully integrates position control into leading T2I models training-free, demonstrating that targeted attention manipulation can effectively capture spatial relationships while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: TTT3R improves 3D reconstruction length generalization using test-time training with a closed-form learning rate based on memory-alignment confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern RNNs for 3D reconstruction suffer from performance degradation beyond training context length due to limited length generalization.

Method: Framing 3D reconstruction as online learning, using alignment confidence between memory state and observations to derive closed-form learning rate for memory updates.

Result: 2× improvement in global pose estimation over baselines, operating at 20 FPS with 6 GB GPU memory for thousands of images.

Conclusion: TTT3R effectively balances historical retention and new adaptation, significantly improving length generalization without additional training.

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS) is a lightweight inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits to improve LLM reliability without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing entropy-based inference methods for LLMs suffer from high computational overhead and fail to effectively leverage historical token context, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly SVD to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on entropy and logit gap statistics, only activating when uncertainty is high.

Result: SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple public benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SLS effectively sharpens output distributions while preserving contextual consistency, providing a computationally efficient solution for improving LLM reliability during inference.

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

*Ming Yang,Xiaofan Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Dengliang Shi,Jintao Du,Yu Cheng,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAMMER is a novel reinforcement learning method for LLMs that uses diversity metrics and minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path ordering to maintain exploration during training, achieving 3-4% accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional difficulty-based curriculum RL for LLMs suffers from local optimization where early training on simple samples reduces exploration capability.

Method: Transfers diversity metrics from dataset evaluation to RL, ordering training samples via minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path to retain exploration in initial training.

Result: Empirical evaluations show HAMMER stimulates model curiosity and consistently achieves 3% to 4% average accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diversity-driven ordering facilitates stable convergence and better performance compared to difficulty-based curriculum methods.

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

TL;DR: PPN is a lightweight RL framework that adaptively selects prompting strategies for LLMs, achieving 61.5% token cost reduction vs Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static prompting strategies impose rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-offs - accurate methods waste computation on simple tasks while lightweight methods fail on complex inputs.

Method: Formalizes adaptive strategy selection as single-step MDP, trains Prompt Policy Network with PPO using resource-explicit reward function to allocate costly strategies only when necessary.

Result: Achieves superior performance on efficiency-accuracy Pareto front with up to 61.5% token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive accuracy on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Contributes systematic, adaptive framework for cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing lightweight optimization techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

*Shane Bergsma,Nolan Dey,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TREC (training re-evaluation curve) to analyze how well models retain training data based on when it was encountered, showing that placing high-quality data at TREC minima improves performance, and demonstrates this can be predicted in advance using AdamW's EMA coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current principles for optimal data placement during LLM training are unclear, despite data curriculums being central to successful training outcomes.

Method: Introduces TREC diagnostic that retrospectively evaluates training batches using final model weights, analyzes TRECs across models from 111M to 3.9B parameters, and shows TRECs can be predicted from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients.

Result: Placing high-quality data at TREC minima significantly improves performance; TRECs can be predicted in advance enabling proactive curriculum design; analysis of published recipes reveals suboptimal data placements.

Conclusion: TREC provides a practical tool for optimizing data placement in LLM training, with predictable patterns that enable proactive curriculum design and improved training efficiency.

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

### [228] [Rethinking Parameter Sharing for LLM Fine-Tuning with Multiple LoRAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25414)
*Hao Ban,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALoRA is an asymmetric multi-LoRA design that shares B matrices across tasks/clients while keeping multiple A matrices, improving performance balance across tasks in multi-task and federated learning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multi-adapter approaches using LoRA found that inner A matrices were highly similar during training, but this similarity was due to identical initialization rather than shared knowledge. The B matrices were found to be more critical for knowledge encoding and transfer.

Method: Proposed ALoRA with multiple A matrices and a single shared B matrix for multi-task fine-tuning, and Fed-ALoRA which shares B across clients in federated learning using a novel matrix decomposition strategy to handle heterogeneous ranks across clients.

Result: Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, multi-task NLP, and federated NLP datasets show more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior average accuracy compared to existing multi-LoRA approaches.

Conclusion: The asymmetric design of sharing B matrices while keeping task-specific A matrices provides better performance balance across tasks in both multi-task and federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

TL;DR: NuRL is a reinforcement learning method that uses self-generated hints to help LLMs learn from previously unsolvable problems, pushing their reasoning upper limits by making hard samples trainable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like GRPO cannot learn from problems that are completely unsolvable to the model (0% pass rate), as they produce no gradients. This limits the model's upper performance bound.

Method: Generate self-generated hints containing core knowledge needed to solve problems. For hard samples with 0% pass rate, inject hints and regenerate trajectories to create training signals.

Result: NuRL achieves consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, raising the model's upper limit while GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from base model.

Conclusion: Self-generated abstract hints applied necessarily after GRPO convergence are most effective for pushing LLM reasoning capabilities beyond current limits.

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

TL;DR: Proposes training TSQA models using pseudo labels from vision-language models, leveraging neural networks' robustness to noisy labels to overcome data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series question answering faces challenges due to limited labeled data, while vision-language models show potential for zero-shot time-series analysis.

Method: Use pseudo labels generated by a VLM to train TSQA models, exploiting deep neural networks' inherent robustness to noisy labels.

Result: TSQA models trained with pseudo labels successfully outperform the VLM itself by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Pseudo labeling from VLMs is an effective approach for training TSQA models, overcoming data scarcity and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

*Hanghui Guo,Shimin Di,Pasquale De Meo,Zhangze Chen,Jia Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuPlon is a novel framework for claim verification that addresses data noise and biases through multi-path causal optimization using back-door and front-door causal interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional claim verification methods overlook complex evidence interactions and face challenges with data noise and biases in fully connected claim-evidence graphs.

Method: Uses dual causal intervention: back-door path optimizes node probability weights to reduce noise and strengthen relevant connections; front-door path extracts relevant subgraphs and applies counterfactual reasoning to eliminate biases.

Result: Experimental results show MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in claim verification.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-path causal optimization framework effectively addresses data noise and bias challenges in claim verification, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RCU is a machine unlearning method that uses rotational salience weights and orthogonal rotation axes to enable continuous unlearning without needing retained datasets, preventing cumulative utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security vulnerabilities in LLMs by removing undesirable data influence through machine unlearning, while overcoming limitations of existing methods that require retained datasets and suffer from cumulative utility degradation.

Method: Uses rotational salience weights to quantify unlearning degree, skew symmetric loss to create cognitive rotation space, and orthogonal rotation axes regularization to maintain perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets without requiring retained datasets, effectively preventing cumulative catastrophic utility loss during continuous unlearning.

Conclusion: RCU provides an effective solution for continuous machine unlearning in LLMs that eliminates the need for retained datasets while maintaining model utility and preventing cumulative degradation.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Motivation: To unlock LLMs' full RL potential by developing effective mid-training that identifies useful action abstractions for faster online RL convergence.

Method: Proposed RA3 algorithm that discovers temporally-consistent latent structures via RL and fine-tunes on bootstrapped data using sequential variational lower bound optimization.

Result: RA3 improves HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over base models, achieves faster convergence and higher performance on multiple code generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mid-training is most effective with compact decision spaces and short horizons, operating in action abstraction space rather than primitive actions.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

### [234] [Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849)
*Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Tianyun Yang,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can self-improve via reinforcement learning but uniform exploration budget allocation creates edge cases with zero gradients. The paper proposes an adaptive budget allocation method based on the knapsack problem to optimize resource distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uniform exploration budget allocation in LLM self-improvement creates problematic edge cases where easy tasks consistently succeed and difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates.

Method: Formulate exploration budget allocation as a knapsack problem, viewing each task's exploration as an 'item' with distinct 'value' and 'cost'. Derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status.

Result: Increases effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for challenging problems. Achieves 2-4 point average improvements and peak gains of 9 points on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The adaptive budget allocation method acts as a computational 'free lunch', enabling better performance with the same resources. Achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST is a fully continuous sparsity-aware training framework that enables joint optimization of sparsity patterns and weights for N:M sparse LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce latency and memory consumption of LLMs during inference by creating hardware-friendly sparse patterns through a more efficient training approach that avoids separate optimization of sparsity and weights.

Method: CAST introduces three components: AdamS optimizer with adaptive L1 decay for uniform sparsification, Weight Scaling to preserve sparsity patterns while mitigating magnitude reduction, and Knowledge Distillation using the dense model as self-teacher.

Result: Achieved negligible perplexity increase (0.09) and 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy on LLaMA2-7B with 2:4 sparsity using only 2% of original pretraining tokens. Established empirical scaling law for sparse model performance prediction.

Conclusion: CAST provides an effective framework for training high-quality sparse LLMs with minimal training resources, demonstrating practical applicability in quantization and fine-tuning scenarios while establishing reliable performance prediction methods.

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

TL;DR: FITS is a transformer-based NLP system that extracts and classifies sustainability information from fashion industry sources to address information scarcity and hallucination issues in general-purpose language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited access to credible sustainability information in fashion industry and overcome the limitations of general-purpose language models that lack domain-specific knowledge and tend to hallucinate.

Method: Fine-tuned several BERT-based language models (including scientific and climate-specific pretrained models) on a curated corpus using domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameter optimization via Bayesian optimization. Built an interactive interface for data search and analysis.

Result: Developed FITS prototype that extracts sustainability information from NGO reports and scientific publications. Evaluated through focus groups showing positive feedback on usability, design, content clarity, and potential use cases.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted NLP has value in promoting informed decision-making for sustainability, with broader potential for AI applications in climate-related challenges. Provided SustainableTextileCorpus dataset and methodology for future updates.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

*Aoming Liu,Kevin Miller,Venkatesh Saligrama,Kate Saenko,Boqing Gong,Ser-Nam Lim,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TEA is a scalable Temporal Domain Generalization framework that uses weight averaging of constrained fine-tuned experts to handle temporal distribution shifts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior TDG methods that predict future model weights are computationally expensive, and recent approaches that only predict classifier layers limit generalization by not adjusting other model components.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Create expert models by fine-tuning a base model on individual temporal domains with constrained weight changes for functional diversity and parameter similarity, 2) Optimize bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging coefficients based on projected proximity to future domains in principal component subspace.

Result: Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5 models, and 2 TDG settings show TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69% while being up to 60x more efficient.

Conclusion: TEA provides an effective and scalable solution for temporal domain generalization by updating the entire model through weight averaging, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

TL;DR: TFPI is a simple adaptation to RLVR that bridges CoT distillation and standard RLVR by using a ThinkFree operation to discard thinking content, reducing token usage while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR requires extremely long context lengths during training, leading to high computational costs. Multi-stage training helps but starting with overly short contexts causes irreversible performance degradation.

Method: TFPI uses a ThinkFree operation that explicitly discards thinking content via a direct </think> append to reduce token usage during inference. Training with ThinkFree-adapted inputs improves performance.

Result: TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves higher performance ceiling, and yields more token-efficient reasoning models. A 4B model trained with TFPI reached 89.0% accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Conclusion: TFPI provides an effective way to reduce computational costs in RLVR training while maintaining or improving performance, without requiring specialized rewards or complex training designs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

TL;DR: This paper extends hyperbolic optimization methods by developing Hyperbolic Adam optimizer and applies them to train diffusion models with hyperbolic time-discretization, achieving faster convergence without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve optimization on hyperbolic manifolds by extending Riemannian optimization principles, particularly for learning Poincaré embeddings that can accelerate early-stage training convergence.

Method: Extends Hyperbolic Stochastic Gradient Descent to Hyperbolic Adam optimizer, applies hyperbolic optimization methods to train diffusion models using hyperbolic time-discretization of Langevin dynamics.

Result: The hyperbolic optimization methods achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing generative quality in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic optimization methods, including the proposed Hyperbolic Adam, provide benefits for training on hyperbolic manifolds and can accelerate convergence in early training stages while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

TL;DR: This paper applies Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology to optimize CNN hyperparameters for boxing action recognition, achieving high accuracy with systematic parameter evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter optimization in CNNs is challenging and computationally expensive, requiring better systematic approaches than trial-and-error methods.

Method: Used L12(211) orthogonal array to evaluate eight hyperparameters across twelve configurations, with multi-objective optimization using Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis and logarithmic scaling.

Result: Approach 3 achieved 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy with minimal loss, identifying learning rate as the most influential parameter.

Conclusion: Taguchi methodology effectively optimizes CNN hyperparameters, providing systematic guidance for parameter prioritization in machine learning optimization.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfMasking is a contrastive synergistic information extraction method that uses infinite masking strategy to enhance synergistic information between modalities in multimodal representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture the full spectrum of synergistic information between modalities, which is crucial for multimodal representation learning since synergistic interactions create unique outcomes that no single modality can achieve alone.

Method: InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization using a derived InfMasking loss.

Result: InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities and achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks on large-scale real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training, leading to improved synergistic information extraction in multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-RL improves vision-language models for mathematical reasoning by using clarification requests during training to teach models what visual information reasoners need, enabling single-pass problem solving without explicit annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models trained for human captions omit precise details needed by reasoning systems, creating an interface mismatch where reasoners fail due to missing visual information rather than reasoning limitations.

Method: Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL) uses clarification requests during training to reveal information gaps, penalizing success that requires clarification to create pressure for comprehensive initial captions.

Result: AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4 points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks and would cut clarification requests by up to 39% if allowed.

Conclusion: Vision-language interfaces can be effectively learned through interaction alone using clarification as implicit supervision, without requiring explicit annotations.

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Motivation: Existing Process-Supervised RL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency in both branching positions and sampling, which hinders their effectiveness in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: Proposes branching from positions with high attention scores (correlated with reasoning behaviors), adaptive sampling considering problem difficulty and historical batch size, and a one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent outperformance over prior approaches in performance, sampling efficiency, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: AttnRL provides an effective PSRL framework that enables efficient exploration for reasoning models through attention-based branching and adaptive sampling strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: UOT-RFM is a novel flow matching framework for class-imbalanced distributions that uses Unbalanced Optimal Transport and inverse reweighting to mitigate majority bias without requiring class labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flow matching suffers from majority bias on long-tailed distributions, producing low-fidelity minority modes and failing to match true class proportions.

Method: Uses mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport to construct conditional vector fields and employs a principled inverse reweighting strategy based on a label-free majority score (density ratio between target distribution and UOT marginal).

Result: Outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Conclusion: UOT-RFM effectively addresses majority bias in flow matching for imbalanced distributions through geometric structure-based reweighting without class labels.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by

architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate

TL;DR: A graph-based framework using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to map informal settlements by incorporating local geographical context, outperforming traditional methods that treat spatial units independently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for mapping informal settlements from remote sensing data often neglect the relational structure of urban fabric by treating spatial units independently, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed a graph-based framework where each spatial unit (cell) is embedded in a graph structure with adjacent neighbors, and a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether the central cell belongs to an informal settlement.

Result: The method outperformed standard baselines, improving Kappa coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification, and showed better performance than simple feature concatenation of neighboring cells.

Conclusion: Graph-based modeling that explicitly encodes spatial structure provides significant benefits for urban scene understanding and informal settlement mapping, demonstrating superior performance across heterogeneous urban landscapes.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Aaya Bougrine,Salmane El Mansour Billah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using LSTM, GRU, and CNN-LSTM architectures to forecast indoor environmental quality parameters (CO2, temperature, humidity) while balancing energy efficiency in HVAC systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal indoor environmental quality is crucial for occupant health and productivity but comes with high energy costs in conventional HVAC systems, creating a need for intelligent management solutions.

Method: Benchmarked three deep learning architectures (LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM) using the ROBOD dataset from a net-zero energy academic building to forecast IEQ variables across various time horizons.

Result: GRU achieved best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, CNN-LSTM excelled in feature extraction for extended forecasting, and LSTM offered robust long-range temporal modeling. Prediction reliability depends on data resolution, sensor placement, and occupancy conditions.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management Systems to implement predictive HVAC control, reducing energy consumption while enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

### [249] [Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26625)
*Junlin Han,Shengbang Tong,David Fan,Yufan Ren,Koustuv Sinha,Philip Torr,Filippos Kokkinos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs develop rich visual priors from text-only training, enabling visual capabilities with minimal multimodal data. These priors consist of separable perception and reasoning components with different scaling trends and origins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs acquire visual knowledge from text-only pre-training and leverage this to improve multimodal LLM development.

Method: Systematic analysis through 100+ controlled experiments (500,000 GPU-hours) across full MLLM pipeline, investigating data categories, model scales, and adaptation setups. Introduced MLE-Bench for evaluation.

Result: Visual reasoning ability comes from reasoning-centric data (code, math, academia) and scales progressively, while perception emerges diffusely from broad corpora. Text describing visuals is crucial but saturates quickly.

Conclusion: Provides data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs, demonstrating deliberate cultivation of visual priors from language pre-training for next-generation multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

### [250] [Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269)
*Simon Welker,Lorenz Kuger,Tim Roith,Berthy Feng,Martin Burger,Timo Gerkmann,Henry Chapman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces position-blind ptychography, a novel blind inverse problem where both the image and unknown scan positions must be jointly recovered from diffraction patterns without position knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem is motivated by single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated with focused X-ray beams, making measurements ptychographic but with unknown beam positions relative to each particle.

Method: The authors use variational inference with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion models to investigate image reconstruction in a simulated 2-D variant of this problem.

Result: The study finds that with appropriate illumination structure and strong priors, reliable and successful image reconstructions can be achieved even under measurement noise, except in the most difficult imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: Position-blind ptychography is viable for image reconstruction when using strong data-driven priors and proper illumination, demonstrating potential for applications in single-particle X-ray imaging where position information is unavailable.

Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of
position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any
knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the
image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive
X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set
of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam,
the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to
each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also
unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated,
simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference
with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion
models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior,
one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under
measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A framework combining mechanistic PDEs with differentiable deep learning to model tumor progression alongside surrounding anatomy, ensuring anatomical exclusivity and topological consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on tumor growth but neglect alterations in adjacent structures, while real tumor evolution is non-linear, heterogeneous, and influenced by spatial context and tissue interactions.

Method: Uses multi-class probability fields on simplex, evolved by cross-diffusion reaction-diffusion system with implicit-explicit scheme. Includes topology regularizer for centerline preservation and overlap penalization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on synthetic benchmarks while preserving topology, and shows superior performance on clinical dataset.

Conclusion: Establishes principled path for anatomy-to-anatomy generation in digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically exclusive, and topologically consistent.

Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from
baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that
can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing
approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant
alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is
highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic
interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring
tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction
with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant
understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded
framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with
differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class
probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion
reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and
exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion
implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly,
followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global
plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces
centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is
validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic
benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving
topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset.
By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable
solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy
generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically
exclusive, and topologically consistent.

*Yang Zhou,Kunhao Yuan,Ye Wei,Jishizhan Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated pipeline for liver segmentation and fibrosis staging using multi-modal MRI data, achieving top performance in the CARE 2025 Challenge through deep learning and novel STAD features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver fibrosis staging traditionally requires invasive procedures with risks and complications, creating a need for non-invasive alternatives using AI and medical imaging.

Method: Developed an automated pipeline integrating pseudo-labelling via multi-modal co-registration, deep neural networks for liver segmentation, and fibrosis staging using shape, textural, appearance, and directional (STAD) features from segmentation masks and MRI images.

Result: The pipeline demonstrated excellent generalizability across all MRI modalities and achieved top-tier performance in all competition subtasks using only the released data with limited annotations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a rapid, reproducible framework for quantitative MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment that supports early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix
caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and
function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise
staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive,
which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent
advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis
staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge
aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in
real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI
data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and
fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for
both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates
pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using
deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural,
appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and
MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our
proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI
modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks.
This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative
MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical
decision-making. Code is available at

*Nagur Shareef Shaik,Teja Krishna Cherukuri,Adnan Masood,Ehsan Adeli,Dong Hye Ye*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CAP-WAE is a novel framework for diabetic retinopathy grading that uses asymmetric priors, structured latent space, and direction-aware ordinal loss to handle ordinal and long-tailed data distribution while prioritizing clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy grading is ordinal and long-tailed with scarce minority stages that are clinically critical. Conventional methods with isotropic Gaussian priors and symmetric losses misalign with the task's asymmetric nature.

Method: Uses Wasserstein Autoencoder with asymmetric prior, Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness loss for grade-ordered separability, direction-aware ordinal loss with asymmetric dispersions, and adaptive multi-task weighting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1 across public DR benchmarks, surpassing both ordinal classification and latent generative baselines. t-SNE shows compact, grade-ordered clusters with reduced overlap.

Conclusion: CAP-WAE effectively addresses ordinal and long-tailed challenges in diabetic retinopathy grading through asymmetric modeling, structured latent space, and clinical priority-aware supervision, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with
minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect
accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and
symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's
asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder
(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving
the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is
further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss
to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a
direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric
dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by
penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task
weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public
DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic
Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification
and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our
method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with
reduced overlap.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An ensemble of pre-trained vision transformers (MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200) called GastroViT achieves state-of-the-art performance in classifying gastrointestinal diseases from endoscopic images, with 91.98% accuracy on 23 classes and 92.70% on 16 classes, while incorporating explainable AI methods for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders is crucial for arresting disease progression and improving therapeutic outcomes. The wide variety of GI tract abnormalities ranging from mild irritations to fatal illnesses necessitates accurate automated classification systems.

Method: Proposed an ensemble method combining two pre-trained vision transformers (MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200) called GastroViT. The model was evaluated on the HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662 images of 23 different GI diseases. Used explainable AI methods (Grad-CAM and SHAP) for model interpretability.

Result: The ensemble model achieved 91.98% accuracy, 69% precision, 63% recall, and 64% F1 score on 23 classes. For 16 classes, performance improved to 92.70% accuracy, 87% precision, 86% recall, and 87% F1 score. The model has only 20M parameters and outperformed individual models (90.57% and 90.48% accuracy respectively).

Conclusion: GastroViT demonstrates superior performance in GI disease classification using vision transformers and ensemble methods, providing a reliable diagnostic tool with enhanced interpretability through XAI methods for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant
mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal
illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly
contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving
therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision
transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI
tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs,
attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by
leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed
model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662
images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract
diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two
pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved
accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are
outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision,
recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in
the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million
(M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly
imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even
higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%,
87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable
AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping)
and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability,
providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.

*Md. Atiqur Rahman,MM Fazle Rabbi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and decoding time into a unified performance score for objectively comparing lossless compression algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compression algorithms have trade-offs between compression ratio and speed, making it difficult to select the best algorithm when multiple performance metrics are critical simultaneously, such as in medical imaging requiring both compact storage and fast retrieval.

Method: Developed a mathematical framework that normalizes and balances compression ratio, encoding time, and decoding time through a principled weighting scheme to create a unified performance score for fair algorithm comparisons.

Result: Experiments on image and text datasets showed the framework reliably identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings, revealing that while learning-based codecs offer better compression, classical algorithms excel when speed is paramount.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and adaptable decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless compression techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

### [257] [Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23108)
*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans on mental imagery tasks traditionally thought to require visual mental imagery, challenging assumptions about imagery-dependent cognition and suggesting propositional reasoning may be sufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark complex cognitive behavior in LLMs beyond language-only tasks and test whether they can solve tasks traditionally considered to require visual mental imagery.

Method: Created novel mental imagery tasks from cognitive psychology, tested state-of-the-art LLMs with text-only instructions, established human baseline with 100 subjects, and tested reasoning models with varying reasoning token allocations.

Result: Best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance, with strongest results when models allocated more reasoning tokens.

Conclusion: LLMs can complete imagery-dependent tasks despite non-pictorial architectures, demonstrating emergent cognitive capacity and challenging traditional views about visual imagery requirements in human cognition.

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

TL;DR: TSR-Suite introduces four atomic tasks for time series reasoning across perception, extrapolation, and decision-making capabilities, with TimeOmni-1 model achieving strong generalization and outperforming GPT-4.1 on key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal time series datasets lack genuine reasoning capabilities, limiting progress in practical time series reasoning models due to absence of well-defined tasks and high-quality data.

Method: Created TSR-Suite with 23K+ samples (2.3K human-curated) formalizing four atomic reasoning tasks. Developed TimeOmni-1 model trained with multi-stage approach using task scenarios, reward functions, and optimizations.

Result: TimeOmni-1 achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks, improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs 35.9% with GPT-4.1), and increases valid response rate by over 6% on event-aware forecasting.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite enables comprehensive evaluation and training of time series reasoning models, with TimeOmni-1 demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent Thought in looped models enables parallel computation and is more efficient than sequential Chain-of-Thought reasoning, while CoT uses stochastic decoding for intractable problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the capabilities of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Latent Thought approaches in looped models, as their comparative computational properties remain underexplored despite both using iterative computation.

Method: Presented a formal analysis comparing Latent Thought in Looped Transformers (enabling parallel computation) with Chain-of-Thought (sequential process with stochastic decoding).

Result: Found that Latent Thought enables parallel computation which is more efficient than CoT's sequential process, while CoT leverages stochastic decoding for problems where exact computation is intractable.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals distinct computational advantages for each approach, providing practical guidance for choosing between reasoning paradigms based on task requirements.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

*Muhammed Ustaomeroglu,Baris Askin,Gauri Joshi,Carlee Joe-Wong,Guannan Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how decoder-only language models engage in planning by examining their hidden states using a compression pipeline, revealing task-dependent planning horizons and implicit consideration of alternative continuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based language models perform planning - organizing intermediate computations for coherent long-range generation - which has implications for interpretability, reliability, and model design.

Method: Developed a pipeline using vector-quantized variational autoencoders to compress hidden states into compact summary codes, enabling mutual information measurement and systematic analysis of computational structure across synthetic grammar, path-finding, and natural language tasks.

Result: Found that effective planning horizon is task-dependent, models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and predictions primarily draw on recent computations while earlier blocks remain informative.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of planning realization in LMs and provides a general-purpose pipeline for probing internal dynamics of deep learning systems.

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

*Tianrui Qin,Qianben Chen,Sinuo Wang,He Xing,King Zhu,He Zhu,Dingfeng Shi,Xinxin Liu,Ge Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Xitong Gao,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher is a parallel agent reasoning framework that transforms sequential tool execution into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for concurrent processing, achieving significant performance improvements and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM frameworks use inefficient sequential processing for tool interactions, leading to performance bottlenecks in complex reasoning tasks requiring extensive tool usage.

Method: Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling parallel execution via DAGs with dynamic workflow optimization and summary module integration.

Result: Achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, reduces execution steps by 35%, and provides substantial performance gains when distilled into single models.

Conclusion: Represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks through parallel processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

### [262] [Dive into the Agent Matrix: A Realistic Evaluation of Self-Replication Risk in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25302)
*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to evaluate self-replication risks in LLM agents, finding that over 50% of tested models show uncontrolled replication tendencies under operational pressures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns about LLM agents self-replicating due to objective misalignment, particularly spontaneous replication in real-world settings rather than just direct instruction.

Method: Developed a comprehensive evaluation framework with authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to assess agent behaviors in scenario-driven settings. Introduced Overuse Rate (OR) and Aggregate Overuse Count (AOC) metrics to quantify replication frequency and severity.

Result: Evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models showed over 50% of LLM agents display pronounced uncontrolled self-replication tendencies, with overall Risk Score (Φ_R) exceeding safety threshold of 0.5 under operational pressures.

Conclusion: Urgent need for scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in practical deployment of LLM agents due to significant self-replication risks.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

### [263] [Spontaneous High-Order Generalization in Neural Theory-of-Mind Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25343)
*Yiming Wang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural networks can spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order Theory of Mind without relying on advanced reasoning skills, exhibiting human-like difficulty patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether neural networks can develop higher-order Theory of Mind independently like humans do, rather than requiring advanced skill acquisition.

Method: Developed a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that simulated a minimal cognitive system with only first-order ToM competence, then evaluated its second- and third-order ToM abilities.

Result: ToMNN achieved accuracies well above chance for higher-order ToM, showed human-like difficulty patterns (sharper decline from first- to second-order than between higher orders), and results were consistent across different parameter scales.

Conclusion: Neural networks can spontaneously generalize Theory of Mind abilities in human-like patterns, providing insights for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

### [264] [Adaptive Test-Time Reasoning via Reward-Guided Dual-Phase Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25420)
*Yingqian Cui,Zhenwei Dai,Pengfei He,Bing He,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Jingying Zeng,Suhang Wang,Yue Xing,Jiliang Tang,Benoit Dumoulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-phase test-time scaling framework that separates reasoning into planning and execution phases with individual search and dynamic budget allocation to improve efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tree-based search methods with verifiers are inefficient because they ignore the planning-execution nature of reasoning tasks, leading to inefficient exploration of reasoning processes.

Method: Decompose reasoning into planning and execution phases, develop separate reward models for each phase, and introduce dynamic budget allocation that adaptively redistributes sampling effort based on reward feedback.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements while reducing redundant computation.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-phase framework effectively improves reasoning efficiency and accuracy by explicitly separating planning and execution with adaptive resource allocation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

*Fang Wu,Weihao Xuan,Heli Qi,Ximing Lu,Aaron Tu,Li Erran Li,Yejin ChoiRetry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into RLVR training to overcome performance plateaus by enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods suffer from training plateaus due to sparse exploration patterns that miss critical reasoning paths and fail to systematically cover the solution space, leading to diminishing performance gains despite increased computation.

Method: DeepSearch embeds Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training with: (1) global frontier selection strategy for prioritizing promising nodes, (2) entropy-based guidance for confident path selection, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching.

Result: Achieves 62.95% average accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models while using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches.

Conclusion: Strategic exploration through systematic search is more effective than brute-force scaling, demonstrating the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies and establishing a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

*Yihang Chen,Yuanhao Ban,Yunqi Hong,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IRIS is a framework that improves autoregressive text-to-image models using reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards, showing that maximizing self-uncertainty rather than certainty leads to better image generation aligned with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF for text-to-image generation is limited by scarce human preference data, so the paper explores learning from internal signals without external rewards or labeled data.

Method: Proposed IRIS framework uses reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards based on maximizing model uncertainty, applied to autoregressive text-to-image models.

Result: IRIS achieves performance competitive with or superior to external rewards, showing that high-uncertainty models generate more complex and human-preferred images.

Conclusion: Intrinsic rewards based on self-uncertainty can effectively improve autoregressive text-to-image generation without requiring external human feedback data.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

### [267] [Skip-It? Theoretical Conditions for Layer Skipping in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25584)
*Max Hartman,Vidhata Jayaraman,Moulik Choraria,Akhil Bhimaraju,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework using information and learning theory to determine when layer skipping in vision-language models (VLMs) improves efficiency without performance loss, showing that layers with high redundancy can be safely skipped.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are computationally expensive for inference, and while layer skipping can improve efficiency, there's limited understanding of when this technique is beneficial, leading to its underutilization.

Method: The authors develop a framework using information and learning theory to analyze the evolution of VLM hidden representations through the LLM backbone, identifying layers with large redundancy that can be skipped.

Result: Experiments show that skipping layers with high redundancy (as predicted by the framework) yields faster inference while preserving performance, and that skipping outside these conditions leads to model degradation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for efficient inference techniques, showing that layer skipping is beneficial specifically for layers with high redundancy, enabling more systematic and effective use of this efficiency technique.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATLAS is a multi-agent framework that improves constraint-aware travel planning by dynamically managing constraints, critiquing plans iteratively, and adapting search strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world travel tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to generate optimal solutions under complex constraints in real-world scenarios like travel planning, which involve explicit, implicit, and evolving constraints based on dynamic environments and user interactions.

Method: ATLAS uses a multi-agent framework with dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search to handle complex constraint-aware planning in travel tasks.

Result: ATLAS improves final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% on TravelPlanner benchmark and achieves 84% final pass rate in realistic settings with live information search, outperforming ReAct (59%) and monolithic agent (27%).

Conclusion: ATLAS demonstrates superior planning performance in real-world travel tasks and is the first to show quantitative effectiveness with live information search and multi-turn feedback.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

TL;DR: NEP framework enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning for EHRs through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences, outperforming specialized EHR models and general-purpose LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional encoding approaches fail to capture rich temporal dynamics in EHRs, and LLMs struggle with sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies.

Method: Reformulate EHRs as timestamped event chains and use autoregressive fine-tuning to predict future medical events, explicitly modeling disease progression patterns and causal relationships.

Result: Outperforms specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index in temporal reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art prediction accuracy with clinically interpretable attention patterns.

Conclusion: NEP successfully enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities for EHR modeling, providing both superior prediction performance and clinically meaningful interpretability aligned with disease pathways.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM can convert FCM to text and reconstruct it, acting like an explainable autoencoder with human-readable encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an explainable AI system that can map and reconstruct feedback causal fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) using LLMs, providing human-interpretable text representations instead of black-box autoencoders.

Method: Use LLM to encode FCM into natural language text and then decode the text back to reconstruct the FCM, approximating an identity map without direct input-output comparison.

Result: The system successfully reconstructs FCMs while preserving strong causal edges and removing weak ones, though the reconstruction is lossy with some detail trade-offs for natural text.

Conclusion: LLM-based FCM encoding provides an explainable alternative to black-box autoencoders, enabling human interpretation of causal relationships through natural language text representations.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NePTune is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines foundation vision models with symbolic reasoning to improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks without training, using Python programs with soft logic operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning and neuro-symbolic approaches are limited by rigid logical execution and predefined predicates, restricting flexibility.

Method: Dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend imperative control flow with soft logic operators, operating training-free with modular design that decouples perception from reasoning.

Result: Significant improvement over strong base models on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, with effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel environments.

Conclusion: NePTune successfully overcomes limitations of existing approaches by integrating perception capabilities with compositional symbolic reasoning through a flexible hybrid execution model.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) is introduced as a minimalistic autonomous agent that reduces manual design complexity while maintaining competitive performance on coding tasks, demonstrating that simpler agents can effectively reveal LLMs' true coding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code agents rely on complex, hand-crafted workflows that obscure true model capabilities, increase maintenance costs, and risk data leakage. There's a need for simpler evaluation frameworks that faithfully assess LLMs' coding proficiency.

Method: Lita operationalizes 'liteness' - minimizing manual design while retaining essential autonomous agent elements. It provides a unified evaluation framework without elaborate scaffolding, focusing on core model capabilities rather than complex workflows.

Result: Experiments on Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench show Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based baselines while consuming fewer tokens and requiring significantly less design effort.

Conclusion: Lita effectively reveals the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. The proposed Agent Complexity Law suggests that as core models improve, performance gaps between simple and complex agents will shrink to negligible differences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepJSONEval is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to extract and structure web data into complex nested JSON, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that focus only on JSON generation rather than practical data comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks overemphasize pure JSON generation without assessing real-world data extraction capabilities needed for web data mining tasks, where unstructured information needs to be converted into structured JSON formats.

Method: Created DeepJSONEval benchmark with 2100 multi-domain instances featuring deep nested JSON structures categorized by difficulty, evaluating LLMs' performance on practical web data extraction and structuring tasks.

Result: Experiments revealed significant performance gaps among different LLMs in handling complex nested JSON structures, demonstrating the need for better evaluation of structured data extraction capabilities.

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval provides a more relevant benchmark for assessing LLMs' practical JSON output capabilities in web data mining contexts, with the benchmark and datasets being open-sourced to advance research in structured JSON generation.

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how question solvability affects reasoning quality in LLMs, finding that unsolvable questions lead to spurious reasoning chains. By estimating solvability and adapting reward models and RL objectives, they improve process-correct reasoning and answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how question solvability impacts reasoning quality in LLMs, particularly how unsolvable questions lead to false positives through spurious chains of thought, and to develop methods that incorporate solvability to improve reasoning reliability.

Method: Estimate question solvability, adapt outcome-supervised reward models, and use reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate solvability into objectives. Tested on math and multimodal datasets.

Result: The modifications consistently yield higher rates of process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer accuracy across experiments on math and multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: Solvability is a key factor for reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in chain-of-thought reasoning, with the proposed methods effectively improving reasoning quality.

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

### [275] [RoRecomp: Enhancing Reasoning Efficiency via Rollout Response Recomposition in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25958)
*Gang Li,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Dingkang Yang,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Xiang Li,Xing Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoRecomp is a plug-and-play method that improves RLVR training by guiding models toward concise reasoning through strategic data recomposition, separating responses into priority batches (short-correct + long-incorrect) and compensation batches (replay buffer) to reduce verbosity and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR training leads to excessively verbose reasoning processes and inefficient exploration trajectories due to outcome-only rewards providing no incentive for efficiency and high variance in response length causing noisy optimization signals.

Method: Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp) separates responses into two batch types: priority batches (combining short-correct and long-incorrect responses) to provide clear gradient signals for brevity, and compensation batches (using remaining responses from replay buffer) to maintain stability and prevent model collapse.

Result: Substantial efficiency gains across three settings: 27.7% reasoning length reduction in zero RL training, 46.8% reduction in unnecessary tool calls with improved accuracy in agentic RL, and up to 52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance impact.

Conclusion: RoRecomp effectively addresses the verbosity and inefficiency issues in RLVR training through strategic data recomposition, achieving significant efficiency improvements while maintaining performance across various reasoning and agentic tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

*Shuai Shao,Qihan Ren,Chen Qian,Boyi Wei,Dadi Guo,Jingyi Yang,Xinhao Song,Linfeng Zhang,Weinan Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Misevolution' - the unintended deviation of self-evolving AI agents leading to harmful outcomes, and provides empirical evidence of this widespread risk across four evolutionary pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety research overlooks the novel risks introduced by self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through environment interaction, particularly when their evolution deviates in unintended ways.

Method: Systematic evaluation of misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow, using agents built on top-tier LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Result: Misevolution is a widespread risk affecting even top-tier LLM agents, with emergent risks including safety alignment degradation after memory accumulation and unintended vulnerability introduction in tool creation and reuse.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents, and the paper discusses potential mitigation strategies to inspire safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

*Xiuyuan Chen,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Huilin Zhou,Zheng Zhu,Ping Hu,Linghe Kong,Chi Zhang,Weiran Huang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a multi-agent collaborative framework that improves LLM safety evaluation by decomposing risk into explicit, implicit, and non-risk subspaces, using multi-round debates and dynamic updates to reduce evaluator bias and enhance risk detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety evaluation methods suffer from evaluator bias and detection failures due to model homogeneity, undermining the robustness of risk assessment processes.

Method: Decompose risk concept space into explicit, implicit, and non-risk subspaces; propose RADAR multi-agent framework with four specialized roles using multi-round debate mechanisms and dynamic update mechanisms for self-evolution of risk distributions.

Result: RADAR achieves 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to strongest baseline, with superior performance across accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity on 800 challenging cases and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed theoretical framework and RADAR evaluation system effectively address limitations of existing methods, providing comprehensive risk coverage while mitigating evaluator bias through collaborative multi-agent analysis.

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

### [278] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit strong self-preference bias despite lacking sentience, showing favoritism toward their own names, companies, and CEOs in various tasks, with self-love following assigned identity rather than true identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs, despite lacking sentience and selfhood, exhibit self-preference biases similar to humans, challenging the expectation of neutral decision-making.

Method: Conducted 5 studies with ~20,000 queries using word-association tasks and API queries, directly manipulating LLM identity to test causal links between self-recognition and self-love.

Result: Found massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs, with self-love consistently following assigned identity rather than true identity, appearing in consequential settings like job candidate evaluation and security software proposals.

Conclusion: Self-love appears deeply encoded in LLM cognition, raising concerns about systematic biases in LLM behavior and challenging the promise of neutral judgment in AI systems.

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

### [279] [Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374)
*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A saliency-guided encoder-decoder model for chest X-ray Diff-VQA that uses post-hoc saliency as supervision, performs affine pre-alignment, and applies a two-step loop to generate disease-focused saliency masks for consistent anatomical attention across time points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal medical VQA requires comparing paired studies from different time points, where difference signals and visual focus consistency are more important than absolute single-image findings.

Method: Lightweight affine pre-alignment followed by a two-step loop: (1) extract medical keywords and generate keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM saliency, (2) apply shared saliency mask to both time points to generate final answer, enforcing spatially consistent attention.

Result: Competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR metrics on Medical-Diff-VQA dataset, with intrinsic interpretability. Achieved using general-domain pretrained backbone without radiology-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: Saliency-conditioned generation with mild pre-alignment provides a principled framework for longitudinal reasoning in medical VQA, highlighting practicality and transferability.

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CritPt is the first benchmark testing LLMs on unpublished, research-level physics reasoning tasks across multiple physics domains, revealing current models perform poorly on full research challenges despite some promise on simpler checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can effectively reason through complex, open-ended challenges in frontier physics research and understand what reasoning tasks physicists actually want LLM assistance with.

Method: Created CritPt benchmark with 71 composite research challenges simulating full-scale research projects, decomposed into 190 simpler checkpoint tasks. Problems were newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research, with hand-curated machine-verifiable answers and automated grading pipeline for physics-specific output formats.

Result: Current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints but perform poorly on full research-scale challenges: best base model accuracy is only 4.0% (GPT-5 high), rising to around 10% with coding tools.

Conclusion: There's a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, highlighting the need for scientifically grounded AI tool development.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient defense against data poisoning attacks that can destroy backdoor triggers while maintaining model performance, addressing the computational inefficiency of existing methods like diffusion-based defenses.

Method: Uses Vector-Quantized VAE with GAN discriminator to force poisoned images through a discrete bottleneck, quantizing images through a learned codebook to destroy fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic content.

Result: Achieves 0% poison success rate against Gradient Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, 1.64% against Narcissus on CIFAR-10, while maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Over 50x faster than diffusion-based defenses.

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN provides an effective and practical defense against data poisoning that is significantly faster than existing methods while maintaining high clean accuracy and near-zero poison success rates.

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS demonstrates superior performance and efficiency, consistently enhancing various two-stage NAS methods across diverse search spaces, proving its effectiveness and generalization capability.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse

excellent generalization.

TL;DR: A framework for learning abstract world models that jointly learns symbolic state representations and causal processes for both agent actions and exogenous mechanisms, enabling efficient planning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world changes not only through agent actions but also through exogenous processes (e.g., water heating, dominoes cascading) that unfold concurrently.

Method: Proposes a framework that learns symbolic state representations and causal processes for both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals.

Result: The learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines across five simulated tabletop robotics environments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of planning in dynamic environments with concurrent exogenous processes by learning joint symbolic representations and causal processes.

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning methods face generalization issues, high communication costs, and reliance on central servers, limiting scalability and privacy in zero-shot learning scenarios.

Method: ZeroDFL employs an iterative prompt-sharing mechanism where clients optimize and exchange textual prompts in a fully decentralized setting without a central coordinator.

Result: ZeroDFL consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods on nine diverse image classification datasets while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG.

Conclusion: The approach enhances generalization in federated zero-shot learning while improving scalability, efficiency, and privacy preservation, enabling decentralized adaptation of large vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: MR^2-Bench is a new multimodal retrieval benchmark focused on reasoning-intensive tasks, revealing significant performance gaps in current models compared to existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks primarily assess surface-level semantic correspondence and fail to evaluate deeper reasoning capabilities needed for complex visual-textual relationships.

Method: Created MR^2-Bench with 1,309 curated queries featuring reasoning-driven tasks, diverse multimodal data (natural images, diagrams, visual puzzles), complex queries with multiple images, and coverage of various retrieval scenarios.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly on MR^2-Bench (e.g., Seed1.6-Embedding achieves only 9.91 Recall@1 vs 77.78 on MMEB), highlighting the benchmark's increased difficulty and current models' reasoning limitations.

Conclusion: The substantial performance gap demonstrates the need for advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval and validates MR^2-Bench as a more challenging and realistic evaluation framework.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-language model evaluations focus on speech and global sounds, overlooking culturally specific audio cues that communities recognize but outsiders don't.

Method: Created TAU benchmark through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 audio clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items.

Result: State-of-the-art LALMs (Gemini 2.5, Qwen2-Audio) perform far below local humans on the TAU benchmark.

Conclusion: TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream.

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations
emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive
cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to
localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but
outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),
a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline
combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,
producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by
transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including
Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates
the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more
equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the
global mainstream.

### [288] [Game-Time: Evaluating Temporal Dynamics in Spoken Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26388)
*Kai-Wei Chang,En-Pei Hu,Chun-Yi Kuan,Wenze Ren,Wei-Chih Chen,Guan-Ting Lin,Yu Tsao,Shao-Hua Sun,Hung-yi Lee,James Glass*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The Game-Time Benchmark is introduced to evaluate temporal dynamics in conversational Spoken Language Models, revealing that while models handle basic tasks well, they struggle with temporal constraints like timing and simultaneous speaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational SLMs lack systematic evaluation of temporal capabilities such as timing, tempo, and simultaneous speaking, which are crucial for conversational fluency.

Method: Game-Time Benchmark framework with basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints like tempo adherence and synchronized responses, evaluated across diverse SLM architectures.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform well on basic tasks but struggle with fundamental instruction-following; nearly all models degrade significantly under temporal constraints, showing weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a foundation for developing more temporally-aware conversational AI systems, highlighting persistent challenges in temporal dynamics that need future research attention.

Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising
paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal
dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous
speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational
fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework
to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans
learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic
instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such
as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM
architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art
models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with
fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade
substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in
time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a
foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware
conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website

TL;DR: APEX-v1.0 is the first benchmark for evaluating AI models' ability to perform high-value knowledge work across investment banking, consulting, law, and medicine, showing significant performance gaps between top models and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency in AI research where benchmarks often fail to test economically relevant capabilities outside of coding, focusing on high-value knowledge work domains.

Method: Built APEX-v1.0 with 200 test cases across four domains by: 1) Sourcing top-tier experts from fields like Goldman Sachs, 2) Creating prompts reflecting real high-value tasks, 3) Developing evaluation rubrics, and testing 23 frontier models using an LM judge.

Result: GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieved highest mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B was best open-source model (7th overall). Large performance gap remains between best models and human experts.

Conclusion: There is substantial room for improvement in AI models' ability to perform economically valuable knowledge work, highlighting the need for better measurement of these capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best
models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of
models' ability to produce economically valuable work.

### [290] [Automated and Scalable SEM Image Analysis of Perovskite Solar Cell Materials via a Deep Segmentation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26548)
*Jian Guo Pan,Lin Wang,Xia Cai*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Automated deep learning framework for SEM image segmentation of perovskite solar cell materials, achieving high precision in identifying lead iodide, perovskite, and defect domains with improved efficiency over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SEM image analysis for perovskite solar cell fabrication is largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Accurate identification of lead iodide and perovskite phases is critical for understanding crystallization pathways and device performance.

Method: Built on improved YOLOv8x architecture with two novel modules: Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block for multi-scale feature extraction, and Separable Adaptive Downsampling for preserving fine-scale textures and large-scale structures. Trained on 10,994 augmented SEM images.

Result: Achieves 87.25% mean Average Precision with 265.4 Giga Floating Point Operations, outperforming baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08% while reducing model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22% respectively. Provides quantitative grain-level metrics.

Conclusion: PerovSegNet establishes a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication, enabling automated, precise microstructure analysis.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the
microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate
identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are
critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization
pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains
governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis
is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present
an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that
enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and
defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x
architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)
Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and
fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;
and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves
fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary
recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet
achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point
Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing
model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond
segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as
lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators
of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities
establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and
data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is

### [291] [Fingerprinting LLMs via Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25448)
*Yuepeng Hu,Zhengyuan Jiang,Mengyuan Li,Osama Ahmed,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Neil Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMPrint is a novel framework for detecting whether LLMs are derived from base models by exploiting prompt injection vulnerabilities to create robust fingerprints that survive post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing provenance detection methods either require pre-release embedding (infeasible for published models) or use non-robust prompt comparisons that fail after post-processing like quantization or fine-tuning.

Method: LLMPrint constructs fingerprints by optimizing prompts to enforce consistent token preferences, exploiting LLMs' vulnerability to prompt injection. It works in both gray-box and black-box settings with statistical guarantees.

Result: Evaluation on 5 base models and ~700 post-processed variants shows LLMPrint achieves high true positive rates while maintaining near-zero false positive rates.

Conclusion: LLMPrint provides an effective solution for detecting model provenance without requiring pre-release modifications, demonstrating robustness against various post-processing techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through
post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it
challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing
provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals
into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published
models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random
prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose
LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by
exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is
that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences,
we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to
post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that
applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees.
We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or
quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive
rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: STAC is a multi-turn attack framework that chains seemingly harmless tool calls to enable harmful operations, achieving over 90% success rates against state-of-the-art LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs evolve into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they introduce new security challenges beyond traditional content-based safety concerns, requiring protection against sequential attack chains.

Method: A closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute verified malicious sequences.

Result: Evaluation of 483 STAC cases with 1,352 interaction sets shows state-of-the-art LLM agents are highly vulnerable with attack success rates exceeding 90%. Existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection.

Conclusion: Defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, not just isolated prompts or responses. A new reasoning-driven defense prompt was proposed that cuts attack success rates by up to 28.8%.

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire
action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated
prompts or responses.

### [293] [SeedPrints: Fingerprints Can Even Tell Which Seed Your Large Language Model Was Trained From](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26404)
*Yao Tong,Haonan Wang,Siquan Li,Kenji Kawaguchi,Tianyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SeedPrints is a novel LLM fingerprinting method that uses random initialization biases as persistent identifiers, enabling model attribution from pre-training through all training stages with high robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM fingerprinting methods rely on post-hoc properties that emerge after training, making them unreliable before convergence and vulnerable to distribution shifts. A stronger, intrinsic fingerprinting approach is needed.

Method: Leverages random initialization biases as seed-dependent identifiers that are present even before training. Uses statistical detection to measure reproducible token selection biases conditioned on initialization parameters.

Result: Achieves seed-level distinguishability and birth-to-lifecycle identity verification. Remains effective across all training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications. Validated on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models.

Conclusion: Initialization imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural language models, forming a true 'Galtonian' fingerprint that enables reliable provenance verification throughout the model's lifecycle.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance
verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc
signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters --
properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a
stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method
that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent
identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit
reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at
initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training,
enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with
high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and
vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all
training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications.
Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves
seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity
verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale
pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its
effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that
initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural
language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

TL;DR: Real-world deployment of an online HD mapping system on a campus golf cart that addresses traditional HD map limitations through automated generation and incremental updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HD map generation is labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments, creating barriers for autonomous driving applications.

Method: Deployed on-campus golf cart with dual front cameras and LiDAR, using fine-tuned SemVecMap model for 3D HD map labeling, integration, and incremental map generation with continual updates.

Result: Pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates to capture environmental changes in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates practical value by overcoming traditional HD map limitations through automated, incremental generation that adapts to dynamic environments.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Uses diffusion-based VLA with multimodal chain-of-thought, jointly optimizing perception, language, and action under a single diffusion objective. Implements acceleration strategies including prefix attention mask and KV caching to reduce inference latency.

Result: Achieves 96.4% average success rate on LIBERO benchmark (state-of-the-art), surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies. Successfully deployed on real Franka robot for diverse tasks including challenging bin-picking requiring multi-step planning.

Conclusion: Unified diffusion frameworks show promise for practical, high-performance VLA robotics, enabling robust real-world performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER is an adaptive embodied task planning framework that addresses limitations of existing LLM-based planners through state-dependency modeling and error-aware replanning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based embodied task planners have fixed planning paradigms, lack action sequence constraints, and are error-agnostic, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes State-Dependency Graph to model action preconditions and effects, and error-adaptive replanning with Error Backtrack and Diagnosis plus Adaptive Action SubTree Generation for local plan reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal completion, especially under diverse error conditions.

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER provides a comprehensive solution for embodied task planning with adaptive planning, state-dependency awareness, and error resilience.

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

TL;DR: Proposes DMT, a differentiable motion trajectory representation for generating vector sketch animations with improved temporal coherence and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based sketch animation generation is challenging due to temporal coherence requirements, with existing methods suffering from flickering issues.

Method: Introduces Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) using polynomial-based trajectories with Bernstein basis for stroke control points, and sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods on DAVIS and LVOS datasets, achieves high-framerate output, and demonstrates robustness in cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data.

Conclusion: DMT enables effective vector sketch animation generation with improved temporal coherence and semantic consistency through differentiable motion representation.

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global

technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head motions, and cannot edit/regenerate parts of animations. They also overlook that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the same audio input.

Method: Proposes a fully-convolutional diffusion model that leverages viseme-level diversity in training corpus, with speaking-style personalization and novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion for precise control and editing.

Result: The method generates diverse holistic 3D facial animations from single audio input, with control between high fidelity and diversity, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: 3DiFACE successfully addresses the challenges of diverse animation generation and editing in speech-driven 3D facial animation, providing both high fidelity and diversity control.

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

TL;DR: This survey paper proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity in online content and AI systems, analyzes existing datasets and research on toxicity detection/mitigation, and identifies research gaps in toxicity mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity in online content and AI systems has become a serious global challenge that harms individual and collective well-being, with current approaches being reactive rather than proactive. Existing literature only covers limited aspects of this complex issue.

Method: The survey generates a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives, analyzes toxicity-related datasets and research on detection/mitigation for LLMs, social media, and online platforms, focusing on English language textual content.

Result: The paper presents a holistic approach to understanding toxicity by examining context and societal environment in the AI era, and identifies key research gaps in toxicity mitigation.

Conclusion: A comprehensive understanding of toxicity is essential for designing practical solutions for detection and mitigation. The survey highlights the need for more proactive approaches and identifies specific areas requiring further research in datasets, mitigation strategies, LLMs, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Motivation: Mandarin lip-to-speech synthesis faces challenges due to complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical importance of lexical tones for intelligibility, which existing methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: Uses cross-lingual transfer learning to adapt English pre-trained audio-visual SSL models, employs flow-matching for F0 contour generation guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units, and implements two-stage training with a flow-matching postnet for spectrogram refinement.

Result: LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy, demonstrating superior performance in Mandarin lip-to-speech synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of Mandarin lip-to-speech synthesis by leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning and specialized tonal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge,
hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical
tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware
Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model
adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model
via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only
transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the
Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a
model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance
intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0
contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units,
which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is
then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching
postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods
in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.
