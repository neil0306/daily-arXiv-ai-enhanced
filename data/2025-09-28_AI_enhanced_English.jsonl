Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number\nof queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To\naddress these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called\nHybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous\nselection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques\nwith GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection\nalgorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining\nthe generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each\nselection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of\nqueries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of\nBinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best\nmethod(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required\nqueries per attack up 25.82\\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,\nwithout losing the effectiveness of the attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes Hybrid and Dynamic Select strategies to reduce query costs in black-box adversarial text attacks by combining BinarySelect and GreedySelect methods, achieving up to 25.82% query reduction while maintaining attack effectiveness.", "motivation": "Transformer-based architectures have increased computational costs for adversarial testing, making existing black-box attack methods inefficient due to high query requirements, especially for researchers with limited GPU resources.", "method": "Two new attack selection strategies: Hybrid Select (merges BinarySelect and GreedySelect using size threshold) and Dynamic Select (learns optimal application lengths for each selection method).", "result": "Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, sentence-level Hybrid Select reduces required queries per attack by up to 25.82% on average against both encoder models and LLMs, while maintaining attack effectiveness.", "conclusion": "The proposed selection strategies significantly reduce computational costs of adversarial text attacks without compromising effectiveness, making attack testing more accessible to researchers with limited resources."}}

Existing deep learning methods,\nparticularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive\npredictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of\nphysical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously\ncapture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:\nlocal, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,\nwe propose the\n{\\textbf{\\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\\textbf{\\underline{I}}}ntegral\n{\\textbf{\\underline{N}}}eural {\\textbf{\\underline{O}}}perator (\\method{}), a\nnovel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator\ndecomposition. \\method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through\nparallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential\noperator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably\nconverges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a\nTransformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This\nphysics-based decomposition endows \\method{} with exceptional stability and\nrobustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow\nbenchmark, we demonstrate that \\method{} significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting.
