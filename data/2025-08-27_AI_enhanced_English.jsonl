Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit\n\\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling\nirony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a\nsemantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical\ncomputation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward\nstability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,\ntensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a\nmodel of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,\nbut also philosophically significant.

A reliable model\nshould perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does\nnot. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by\nevaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer\nconsistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three\nLVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable\nperception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three\nconfidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable\nindicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To\nenhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration\nmethods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.\nAdditionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that\njointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering\nperformance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level\ncompared to LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LVLMs have reasonable knowledge boundary perception but need improvement.
