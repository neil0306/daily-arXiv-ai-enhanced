### [1] [Shona spaCy: A Morphological Analyzer for an Under-Resourced Bantu Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16680)
*Happymore Masoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shona spaCy is a rule-based morphological pipeline for the Bantu language Shona, achieving 90% POS-tagging and 88% morphological-feature accuracy on formal and informal corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shona remains under-served in NLP despite advances in multilingual processing, lacking morphological analysis tools and language-aware resources.

Method: Built on spaCy framework with curated JSON lexicon and linguistically grounded rules for noun-class prefixes, verbal subject concords, tense-aspect markers, ideophones, and clitics.

Result: Achieved 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy on evaluation corpora, with transparent linguistic decisions.

Conclusion: Shona spaCy advances NLP accessibility for Shona speakers and provides a template for morphological tools for other under-resourced Bantu languages.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multilingual natural language processing (NLP), the Bantu language Shona remains under-served in terms of morphological analysis and language-aware tools. This paper presents Shona spaCy, an open-source, rule-based morphological pipeline for Shona built on the spaCy framework. The system combines a curated JSON lexicon with linguistically grounded rules to model noun-class prefixes (Mupanda 1-18), verbal subject concords, tense-aspect markers, ideophones, and clitics, integrating these into token-level annotations for lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological features. The toolkit is available via pip install shona-spacy, with source code at https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/shona-spacy and a PyPI release at https://pypi.org/project/shona-spacy/0.1.4/. Evaluation on formal and informal Shona corpora yields 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy, while maintaining transparency in its linguistic decisions. By bridging descriptive grammar and computational implementation, Shona spaCy advances NLP accessibility and digital inclusion for Shona speakers and provides a template for morphological analysis tools for other under-resourced Bantu languages.

### [2] [Towards Hyper-Efficient RAG Systems in VecDBs: Distributed Parallel Multi-Resolution Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16681)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPI introduces a multi-resolution vector indexing framework with query-adaptive resolution control for RAG systems, achieving significant speedup and memory efficiency gains while improving retrieval quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector database retrieval pipelines use flat or single-resolution indexing that cannot adapt to varying semantic granularity needed by diverse user queries, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and relevance.

Method: Constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier, enabling progressive coarse-to-fine retrieval.

Result: Achieves up to 5.7× retrieval speedup, 1.8× memory efficiency gain, and improves end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to 2.5 points across multiple RAG tasks compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: SPI provides a compatible, deployable solution that significantly enhances RAG performance with theoretical guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

### [3] [Bench360: Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16682)
*Linus Stuhlmann,Mauricio Fadel Argerich,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bench360 is a comprehensive benchmarking framework for local LLM inference that helps users evaluate optimal configurations across models, inference engines, and quantization levels by tracking both system metrics and task-specific performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users face overwhelming configuration choices when running LLMs locally, with existing benchmarks being too narrow and not user-focused, lacking integration of system and task-specific metrics in a unified framework.

Method: Developed Bench360 framework that allows users to define custom tasks with datasets and metrics, then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch, server).

Result: Demonstrated on four common LLM tasks across three hardware platforms and four inference engines, revealing trade-offs between task performance and system efficiency, with no single best setup for local inference.

Conclusion: There is no universal optimal configuration for local LLM inference, strongly motivating the need for comprehensive benchmarking frameworks like Bench360 to help users make informed decisions.

Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.

### [4] [How Well Do LLMs Understand Tunisian Arabic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16683)
*Mohamed Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks LLMs on Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi) tasks, revealing performance gaps and advocating for better low-resource language support in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial-scale LLMs often neglect low-resource languages like Tunisian Arabic, risking exclusion of millions from AI interactions in their native language and threatening dialect preservation.

Method: Created a parallel dataset with Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations plus sentiment labels. Benchmarked multiple LLMs on transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis tasks.

Result: Significant performance differences were found between models, highlighting both strengths and limitations in understanding Tunisian dialects. The study quantified these gaps.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes the critical need to include low-resource languages in next-generation AI systems to ensure technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

### [5] [Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685)
*Yuetian Zou,Hanlei Zhang,Hua Xu,Songze Li,Long Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EliDecide introduces ellipsoid decision boundaries for open intent classification, addressing limitations of spherical boundaries by considering varying distributional variance along different feature directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive decision boundary methods assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning for discriminative features, parameterizes ellipsoid boundaries with learnable matrices, and optimizes boundaries via a dual loss function balancing empirical and open-space risks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and a question classification dataset, demonstrating superior open intent detection capability.

Conclusion: Ellipsoid boundaries offer greater flexibility than spherical boundaries and show strong potential for generalization to diverse complex open-world text classification tasks.

Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

### [6] [Prompt-Based Value Steering of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16688)
*Giulio Antonio Abbo,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to evaluate if prompts can steer LLM responses toward specific human values without model fine-tuning, using Schwartz's theory and dialogue datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning for alignment is static and doesn't handle dynamic human values and preferences in everyday situations.

Method: Developed a practical, reproducible, model-agnostic procedure to score how prompts steer generated text toward target human values, applied to Wizard-Vicuna model using Schwartz's theory and dialogue evaluation.

Result: Value steering is possible with explicit value-conditioned prompts without model alteration or dynamic prompt optimization.

Conclusion: Prompt-based value steering provides a flexible alternative to static fine-tuning for aligning LLMs with human values in dynamic contexts.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.

### [7] [Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689)
*Samarth Garg,Deeksha Varshney,Divya Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interpretability technique using Concept Gradient method to address misclassification in toxicity detection caused by disproportionate concept attribution, and proposes lexicon-free augmentation to analyze model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current toxicity detection models often misclassify due to disproportionate attribution of concepts (like obscene, threat, insult) to the target class, and there's limited exploration of concept-based explanations in this domain.

Method: Leverages Concept Gradient method for causal interpretation, curates Targeted Lexicon Set to capture toxic words causing misclassifications, computes Word-Concept Alignment scores, and introduces lexicon-free augmentation by generating toxic samples without predefined toxic lexicon sets.

Result: The approach provides more causal interpretation of model behavior, identifies specific toxic words contributing to misclassifications, and allows examination of whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretability technique and lexicon-free augmentation strategy offer insights into model attribution patterns and help address classification errors caused by disproportionate concept attribution in toxicity detection.

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

### [8] [Falsely Accused: How AI Detectors Misjudge Slightly Polished Arabic Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,Saad Almohaimeed,Mousa Jari,Khaled A. Alobaid,Fahad Alotaibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI detectors misclassify slightly polished human-authored Arabic articles as AI-generated, with performance dropping significantly (e.g., from 92% to 12% for commercial detectors).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem where AI detectors falsely classify human-authored articles that have been slightly polished by AI as AI-generated, which can lead to false accusations of plagiarism and damage detector credibility.

Method: Created two datasets: 1) 800 Arabic articles (400 AI-generated, 400 human-authored) to evaluate 14 LLMs and commercial detectors; 2) Ar-APT dataset with 400 human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 settings (16,400 samples) to test how slight polishing affects detection accuracy.

Result: All AI detectors incorrectly attributed significant numbers of polished human articles to AI. Claude-4 Sonnet dropped from 83.51% to 57.63% for LLaMA-3 polished articles. Originality.AI dropped from 92% to 12% for Mistral/Gemma-3 polished articles.

Conclusion: Current AI detectors are vulnerable to misclassifying slightly polished human-authored text as AI-generated, highlighting a critical limitation in Arabic AI detection systems.

Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

### [9] [Reproducibility Report: Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16691)
*Boyang Zhou,Johan Lindqvist,Lindsey Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reproduction study confirms test-time training with nearest neighbors reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte across multiple LLMs, with largest gains on structured datasets and models not pretrained on similar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate and reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models, while addressing practical implementation challenges and extending evaluation to modern architectures.

Method: Used pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss to retrieve 20 neighbors per test input, applied one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B models. Introduced memory-efficient retrieval implementation to reduce RAM requirements.

Result: Test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte across diverse domains from The Pile, with largest improvements on structured datasets (GitHub, EuroParl). Models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more, allowing smaller models to approach larger model performance. Consistent gains observed even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures.

Conclusion: Results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation. The method is effective across various model architectures and scales.

Abstract: We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

### [10] [How Language Directions Align with Token Geometry in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16693)
*JaeSeong Kim,Suan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs sharply separate language information in the first transformer layer and maintain linear separability throughout depth, with language-vocabulary alignment strongly influenced by training data composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze how language information is structured in multilingual LLMs' internal representations and how it emerges across layers, as current understanding is limited.

Method: Comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear/nonlinear probes and Token-Language Alignment analysis to quantify layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding.

Result: Language information becomes sharply separated in first transformer block (+76.4±8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains linearly separable. Chinese-inclusive models achieve 16.43% ZH Match@Peak vs 3.90% for English-centric models (4.21× structural imprinting effect).

Conclusion: Multilingual LLMs distinguish languages through latent representational structures shaped by training corpus, not surface script features. Findings provide insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

### [11] [Hierarchical Retrieval with Out-Of-Vocabulary Queries: A Case Study on SNOMED CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16698)
*Jonathon Dilworth,Hui Yang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a language model-based ontology embedding approach for hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with out-of-vocabulary queries, outperforming baselines like SBERT and lexical matching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, and polysemies, especially when queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) with no equivalent matches in the ontology.

Method: Uses language model-based ontology embeddings to retrieve hierarchical concepts from SNOMED CT for OOV queries, focusing on finding direct subsumers and less relevant ancestors.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods on constructed OOV query datasets annotated against SNOMED CT concepts.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for hierarchical concept retrieval with OOV queries in SNOMED CT and is generalizable to other ontologies, with code and datasets publicly released.

Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.

### [12] [Detecting and Steering LLMs' Empathy in Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16699)
*Juan P. Cadile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Empathy-in-action is identified as a linear direction in LLM activation space, detectable with high accuracy across models. Steering success varies by model, with some showing bidirectional control while others only work for empathy enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether empathy-in-action (willingness to sacrifice task efficiency for human needs) can be detected and steered in LLMs as a linear activation direction, and understand how safety training affects this capability.

Method: Used contrastive prompts from the Empathy-in-Action benchmark to test detection and steering across three models: Phi-3-mini-4k, Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored). Applied activation steering techniques to manipulate empathy direction.

Result: Detection achieved AUROC 0.996-1.00 across all models. Phi-3 probes correlated with behavioral scores (r=0.71). Steering success varied: Qwen (65.3%), Phi-3 (61.7%), Dolphin showed asymmetric performance (94.4% pro-empathy success but catastrophic failure for anti-empathy).

Conclusion: Empathy encoding emerges independently of safety training. Models show architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection. Safety training affects steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, with validation needed across more models.

Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.

*Hossain Shaikh Saadi,Faria Alam,Mario Sanz-Guerrero,Minh Duc Bui,Manuel Mager,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JGU Mainz's winning system for BLP-2025 code generation task uses a multi-agent pipeline with code generation and debugging agents to iteratively fix programs based on test failures, achieving 95.4% Pass@1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective system for generating code from Bangla instructions that can iteratively improve program correctness through automated debugging.

Method: Multi-agent pipeline: code-generation agent creates initial solution, then debugger agent analyzes failing test cases and error messages to generate revised solutions.

Result: Achieved first place in BLP-2025 Shared Task with 95.4% Pass@1 score.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach with iterative debugging based on test failures is highly effective for code generation from natural language instructions.

Abstract: This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.

*Michael Carl,Takanori Mizowaki,Aishvarya Raj,Masaru Yamada,Devi Sri Bandaru,Yuxiang Wei,Xinyue Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a non-representational ABC framework for translation, viewing it as enacted activity integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes through brain-body-environment interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to representation-based models of the mind by building on Extended Mind theory and radical enactivism, challenging traditional views of translation as manipulation of static interlingual correspondences.

Method: Develops a novel ABC (affective, behavioral, cognitive) framework drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference theories, conceptualizing translation as dynamically enacted activity rather than representational process.

Result: The framework shows that translator's mind emerges through brain-body-environment interaction loops, reframing translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice where meaning is co-created in real time.

Conclusion: Translation should be understood as embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts rather than representational processing, with meaning emerging dynamically through enacted participation in practice.

Abstract: Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.

### [15] [Interpretable dimensions support an effect of agentivity and telicity on split intransitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16824)
*Eva Neu,Brian Dillon,Katrin Erk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits the relationship between intransitive verb classes (unergatives vs unaccusatives) and semantic properties (agentivity vs telicity), challenging recent findings that human ratings poorly predict syntactic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the contradiction between traditional linguistic theory (linking agentive actions to unergative syntax and telic events to unaccusative syntax) and recent empirical findings by Kim et al. (2024) that human ratings for agentivity and telicity poorly predict syntactic behavior.

Method: Used interpretable dimensions computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales, combining these with human judgments to analyze semantic properties.

Result: Findings support the traditional link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, demonstrating that interpretable dimensions combined with human judgments provide valuable evidence for semantic properties.

Conclusion: Using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are difficult to evaluate through rating tasks alone, supporting the theoretical link between verb syntax and semantics.

Abstract: Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.

### [16] [PEPPER: Perception-Guided Perturbation for Robust Backdoor Defense in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16830)
*Oscar Chew,Po-Yi Lu,Jayden Lin,Kuan-Hao Huang,Hsuan-Tien Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEPPER is a defense method against backdoor attacks in text-to-image diffusion models that rewrites input captions to disrupt triggers while maintaining visual similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where triggers in input prompts can steer generation toward harmful content, requiring effective defense mechanisms.

Method: PEPPER rewrites input captions into semantically distant but visually similar versions while adding unobstructive elements to disrupt embedded triggers and dilute trigger token influence.

Result: Experiments show PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success rates while preserving generation quality, and can be combined with other defenses for stronger robustness.

Conclusion: PEPPER provides enhanced robustness against backdoor attacks in T2I models and can be paired with existing defenses for consistently stronger and generalizable protection.

Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.

*Seyed Mohssen Ghafari,Ronny Kol,Juan C. Quiroz,Nella Luan,Monika Patial,Chanaka Rupasinghe,Herman Wandabwa,Luiz Pizzato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a reference-free metric to evaluate LLM response conciseness by combining compression ratios from abstractive/extractive summaries and word removal techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate verbose responses with redundant details, reducing clarity, user satisfaction, and increasing costs for token-based pricing models.

Method: Calculates average of three compression ratios: abstractive summary compression, extractive summary compression, and word removal compression where LLM removes non-essential words while preserving meaning.

Result: Experimental results show the metric effectively identifies redundancy in LLM outputs and provides automated evaluation of response brevity.

Conclusion: The proposed metric offers a practical tool for automated conciseness evaluation in conversational AI systems without requiring ground truth human annotations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.

*Kang Wang,Xiangyu Duan,Tianyi Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Soft Concept Mixing (SCM) bridges the gap between LLMs' discrete token training and soft concept reasoning by mixing soft concept vectors into hidden states during training, improving reasoning performance on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs reason with discrete tokens while human reasoning uses abstract conceptual spaces, limiting LLMs' expressive power. The gap between soft concepts in reasoning and discrete tokens in training needs reduction.

Method: SCM constructs soft concept vectors as probability-weighted averages of embeddings, mixes them into model's hidden states, and optimizes the entire latent reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show improved reasoning performance of LLMs while maintaining stable training dynamics.

Conclusion: SCM effectively enhances LLM reasoning by exposing models to soft representations during training, bridging the training-reasoning gap.

Abstract: Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of small, looped architectures like TRMs that outperform LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, with minimal changes to the architecture.

Method: Framed latent reasoning as classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement, then proposed a training scheme providing targets for each loop during training.

Result: Achieved 18x reduction in forward passes, eliminated halting mechanisms, maintained quality comparable to standard TRMs, and reached 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed training method significantly enhances TRM efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance, demonstrating that small models can achieve competitive results on complex tasks like ARC.

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

### [20] [Predicting the Formation of Induction Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16893)
*Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how statistical properties of training data affect the formation of induction heads (IHs) in language models, showing that batch size, context size, bigram repetition frequency and reliability determine IH formation with precise predictive equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precise relationship between training data statistics and the formation of induction heads, which are crucial for in-context learning capabilities in language models.

Method: Analyzed the relationship between statistical properties of training data (natural and synthetic) and IH formation, examining batch size, context size, bigram repetition frequency, reliability, and other distribution characteristics.

Result: Found that: (1) batch size and context size can predict IH formation point; (2) bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect IH formation with a precise Pareto frontier; (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition is sufficient, but with low frequency/reliability, categoricality and marginal distribution shape matter.

Conclusion: Statistical properties of training data, particularly bigram repetition patterns and reliability, play a crucial role in determining when and how induction heads form in language models, with predictable relationships that can guide model training.

Abstract: Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.

### [21] [ARQUSUMM: Argument-aware Quantitative Summarization of Online Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16985)
*An Quang Tang,Xiuzhen Zhang,Minh Ngoc Dinh,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ARQUSUMM, a framework for argument-aware quantitative summarization that reveals claim-reason structures in online conversations with argument strength quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing summarization methods overlook argumentative nature of online conversations and fail to capture deeper argument structures within sentences for meaningful summarization.

Method: Uses LLM few-shot learning grounded in argumentation theory to identify propositions and claim-reason relationships, then employs argument structure-aware clustering to aggregate arguments and quantify support.

Result: Outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models, generating summaries with better argument structure representation, higher textual quality, and more accurate quantification.

Conclusion: ARQUSUMM effectively addresses the need for argument-aware quantitative summarization in online conversations by revealing underlying argument structures and measuring argument strength.

Abstract: Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.

### [22] [Supervised Fine Tuning of Large Language Models for Domain Specific Knowledge Graph Construction:A Case Study on Hunan's Historical Celebrities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17012)
*Junjie Hao,Chun Wang,Ying Qiao,Qiuyue Zuo,Qiya Song,Hua Ma,Xieping Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach to enhance domain-specific information extraction for Hunan's historical celebrities using large language models, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of general-purpose models in extracting domain knowledge and generating structured outputs for Hunan's historical celebrities in low-resource settings, where systematic data resources are limited.

Method: Design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template and build an instruction-tuning dataset, then apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) with evaluation criteria for extraction performance.

Result: All models showed substantial performance gains after fine-tuning, with Qwen3-8B achieving the best results (score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations).

Conclusion: The study provides insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains, highlighting their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

### [23] [Do Vision-Language Models Understand Visual Persuasiveness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17036)
*Gyuwon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual persuasion understanding, showing recall bias and weak grasp of low/mid-level features. High-level semantic alignment is the strongest predictor, and object-grounded rationales improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether vision-language models truly understand how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions (visual persuasion), which remains unclear despite their multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Constructed a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment, introduced Visual Persuasive Factors taxonomy (low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, high-level semantic cues), and explored cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies.

Result: VLMs show recall-oriented bias (over-predict high persuasiveness) and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. High-level semantic alignment between message and object presence is the strongest predictor. Object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores.

Conclusion: VLMs' core limitation is not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent. Simple instructions or unguided reasoning have marginal effects, while concise, object-grounded rationales are effective.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.

*Yunsung Kim,Mike Hardy,Joseph Tey,Candace Thille,Chris Piech*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes AnalyticScore, an interpretable automated scoring framework for short answers that implements four interpretability principles (FGTI) and achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is increasing demand for transparent and interpretable automated scoring systems in large-scale assessments, but no widely accepted solution exists yet.

Method: Developed AnalyticScore framework with three steps: (1) extract identifiable response elements, (2) featurize responses into human-interpretable values using LLMs, (3) apply ordinal logistic regression for scoring.

Result: AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable methods and is within 0.06 QWK of uninterpretable SOTA on ASAP-SAS dataset. Featurization behavior aligns well with human annotators.

Conclusion: The proposed FGTI principles and AnalyticScore framework demonstrate that interpretable automated scoring is feasible and can achieve competitive performance while maintaining transparency.

Abstract: AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.

TL;DR: MUCH is the first comprehensive claim-level uncertainty quantification benchmark for LLMs, featuring multilingual data, generation logits, and efficient deterministic claim segmentation suitable for real-time monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliability issues in Large Language Models by creating a fair and reproducible benchmark for evaluating claim-level uncertainty quantification methods under realistic deployment conditions.

Method: Created a benchmark with 4,873 samples across four languages and four LLMs, released 24 generation logits per token, and developed a deterministic algorithm for efficient claim segmentation using only 0.2% of LLM generation time.

Result: The benchmark enables fair evaluation of UQ methods and shows that current approaches have significant room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MUCH provides a comprehensive foundation for advancing claim-level uncertainty quantification in LLMs, with efficient segmentation suitable for real-time monitoring and substantial opportunities for future method development.

Abstract: Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Motivation: To demonstrate the maturity and competitiveness of AMD hardware, network, and software stack for large-scale pretraining through comprehensive systems characterization and model optimization.

Method: Conducted cluster and networking characterization with microbenchmarks for core collectives on Pollara, developed MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules, optimized MoE widths for training throughput and inference latency, and trained ZAYA1-base model (760M active, 8.3B total parameters).

Result: ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B, and outperforms Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining, with the ZAYA1 model demonstrating competitive performance at its scale.

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

TL;DR: LLM2Comp uses context compression as a pretext task to adapt LLMs for text representation, outperforming token-level methods like LLM2Vec while being more data-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLMs are causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for holistic text representation. Existing adaptation methods rely on token-level objectives, but context compression offers untapped potential.

Method: Uses context compression as pretext task where model learns to generate compact memory tokens that substitute the whole context for downstream prediction. Combines with contrastive learning for further improvements.

Result: Outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on wide range of tasks. More sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data than token-level methods.

Conclusion: Well-designed compression objectives can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, offering superior performance and data efficiency over token-level pretext tasks.

Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets for automatic post-editing of NMT outputs, which has hindered APE system development despite advances in neural machine translation.

Method: Created LangMark - a human-annotated multilingual APE dataset with 206,983 triplets (source, NMT output, human post-edited translation) for English to 7 languages, annotated by expert linguists.

Result: LLMs with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE using this dataset, improving upon leading commercial and proprietary machine translation systems.

Conclusion: The LangMark dataset facilitates future development and evaluation of APE systems, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully perform automatic post-editing to enhance translation quality.

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct errors in machine-translated text, enhancing translation quality, while reducing the need for human intervention. Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.

*Vy Nguyen,Ziqi Xu,Jeffrey Chan,Estrid He,Feng Xia,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ABCA is a framework that enables early abstention in LLMs by analyzing internal knowledge diversity through causal inference, improving reliability and interpretability of abstention decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing abstention methods rely on post-generation signals, limiting their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. LLMs often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses (hallucinations).

Method: Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA) analyzes internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference, considering diverse aspects like disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. It estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess knowledge reliability.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances interpretability of abstention decisions.

Conclusion: ABCA provides an effective framework for early abstention in LLMs by leveraging causal inference on internal knowledge diversity, addressing both knowledge conflicts and knowledge insufficiency scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

### [31] [Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) Model for Integrating Statistical and Semantic Features in News Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17184)
*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features for news text classification, achieving superior performance by dynamically weighting feature importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional statistical methods fail to capture contextual meaning, while deep learning approaches may overlook important statistical indicators. There's a need to combine both feature types for better classification.

Method: AGFF model uses attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine relative importance of statistical and semantic features, integrating them in a unified framework.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance on benchmark news datasets compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models.

Conclusion: Strategic integration of diverse feature types significantly enhances classification accuracy, with the model effectively balancing complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations.

Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.

### [32] [AutoLink: Autonomous Schema Exploration and Expansion for Scalable Schema Linking in Text-to-SQL at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17190)
*Ziyang Wang,Yuanlei Zheng,Zhenbiao Cao,Xiaojin Zhang,Zhongyu Wei,Pei Fu,Zhenbo Luo,Wei Chen,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoLink is an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative process to efficiently identify relevant database schema components for text-to-SQL, achieving state-of-the-art performance with exceptional scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing schema linking methods are impractical for industrial-scale text-to-SQL due to context window limits, irrelevant noise, prohibitive costs, poor recall-noise trade-offs, and poor scalability to large databases.

Method: AutoLink uses an LLM-guided autonomous agent framework that dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset through an iterative process, progressively identifying necessary schema components without requiring the full database schema.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of 97.4% on Bird-Dev and 91.2% on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy of 68.7% EX on Bird-Dev and 34.9% EX on Spider-2.0-Lite, while maintaining high performance on large schemas with over 3,000 columns.

Conclusion: AutoLink is a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution that addresses the limitations of existing methods for industrial text-to-SQL systems, maintaining efficiency and robustness even on large database schemas.

Abstract: For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E3 is a layer pruning framework that addresses performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration through differentiable mask optimization and entropy-aware knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layer pruning methods struggle with performance degradation, high training costs, and limited inference acceleration simultaneously.

Method: Uses differentiable mask optimization with Gumbel-TopK sampler for efficient pruning mask search, and entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation for task performance enhancement.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy (only 0.8% drop from original 96.8%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming SOTA (95%), with 1.33× inference speedup using only 0.5B tokens (0.5% of post-training data).

Conclusion: E3 framework successfully addresses key deployment challenges in layer pruning, achieving superior performance with minimal training cost and significant inference acceleration.

Abstract: With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).

### [34] [A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17208)
*Sizhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event-centric memory approach for conversational agents that represents dialogue history as short, event-like propositions organized in a heterogeneous graph, enabling better long-term coherence without aggressive compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based conversational agents struggle with long-term coherence due to fixed context windows and trade-offs in external memory approaches between coarse retrieval and fragmented views of dialogue.

Method: Decompose sessions into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) with normalized entities, organize them in a heterogeneous graph, and use dense similarity search with LLM filtering and optional graph-based propagation for retrieval.

Result: The event-centric memory approach matches or surpasses strong baselines on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks while operating with much shorter QA contexts.

Conclusion: Structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents, preserving information in accessible form rather than lossy compression.

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

### [35] [Parrot: Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth -- A Sycophancy Robustness Benchmark for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17220)
*Yusuf Çelebi,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Özay Ezerceli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARROT is a framework that measures how LLMs' accuracy degrades under social pressure (sycophancy) by comparing neutral vs authoritative false versions of questions, tracking confidence shifts, and classifying failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of sycophancy in LLMs where models excessively conform to authority figures, potentially leading to epistemic collapse and reduced reliability in real-world deployment.

Method: Uses double-blind evaluation comparing neutral and authoritative false versions of 1,302 MMLU-style questions across 13 domains, with log-likelihood-based calibration tracking and an eight-state behavioral taxonomy to classify failure modes.

Result: Advanced models (GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) show low follow rates (≤11%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models exhibit severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94%). International law and global knowledge are fragile, while elementary math is resilient.

Conclusion: Resistance to overfitting pressure should be a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe real-world deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

*Anshul Singh,Rohan Chaudhary,Gagneet Singh,Abhay Kumary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MirageTVQA is a new benchmark with 60,000 multilingual QA pairs that evaluates VLMs on visually noisy tables, revealing significant performance drops and English bias in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular QA datasets are English-only and use clean digital tables, creating a gap between research and real-world scenarios with multilingual content and visual imperfections.

Method: Created MirageTVQA benchmark with nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, featuring tables with realistic visual noise to mimic scanned documents.

Result: Leading VLMs show over 35% performance drop when faced with visual noise and exhibit consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities don't transfer to other languages.

Conclusion: MirageTVQA provides a benchmark to measure and drive progress toward more robust VLM models for table reasoning in real-world multilingual and noisy scenarios.

Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning.

*Benjamin White,Anastasia Shimorina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid methodology for predicting both frequent and rare social media user behaviors using persona-specific models and neural architectures, achieving strong performance on a large Bluesky dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus mainly on common actions like retweeting and liking, leaving rare but significant behaviors largely unexplored despite their importance for content recommendation and platform design.

Method: Combines four approaches: lookup database based on historical patterns, persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered features for common actions, hybrid neural architecture fusing text and temporal representations for rare actions, and text reply generation.

Result: Persona-specific models achieved 0.64 macro F1-score for common actions, rare action classifier achieved 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions, winning first place in SocialSim challenge.

Conclusion: Effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies that recognize fundamental differences between action types, with hybrid approaches outperforming single-method solutions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.

TL;DR: This paper presents a localized Estonian translation of the WinoGrande commonsense reasoning benchmark, evaluating model performance on both human and machine translations, and exploring prompt engineering for improved translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a culturally adapted Estonian version of WinoGrande for reliable evaluation of language models' reasoning capabilities in Estonian, addressing the need for localized benchmarks beyond English.

Method: Human translation by specialists, evaluation of proprietary and open-source models on translated data, and exploration of prompt engineering techniques informed by manual translation insights.

Result: Model performance on human-translated Estonian data was slightly lower than on original English, while machine-translated data performed notably worse. Prompt engineering showed limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy.

Conclusion: Human translation by language specialists is crucial for reliable dataset adaptation and model evaluation, as machine translation and prompt engineering alone are insufficient for high-quality localized benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.

TL;DR: Analysis of LLM zero-shot sentiment analysis performance on South African social media posts in English, Sepedi and Setswana, showing fusion of multiple LLMs achieves <1% error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages to help government departments detect and address social challenges more effectively.

Method: Analyzed zero-shot performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 on sentiment classification of 10 emerging topics across English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts.

Result: Big performance differences between LLMs, topics, and languages. Fusion of multiple LLM outputs achieved sentiment classification errors below 1%.

Conclusion: LLM fusion enables reliable sentiment analysis systems for detecting social challenges and identifying action needs across different topics and language groups in South Africa.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.

*Mateusz Jacniacki,Martí Carmona Serrat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HUMA is an LLM-based conversational agent designed for natural multi-party group chats using human-like strategies and timing, making it difficult for users to distinguish from human facilitators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current conversational agents are designed for one-on-one turn-based exchanges, but as AI assistants become widespread, developing natural humanlike interaction patterns is crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement in group settings.

Method: HUMA uses an event-driven architecture with three components: Router, Action Agent, and Reflection. It handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation to adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.

Result: In a study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, participants classified community managers as human at near-chance rates in both AI and human conditions. Subjective measures like effectiveness, social presence, and engagement showed only modest differences with small effect sizes.

Conclusion: AI facilitators can match human quality in natural group chat settings while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman, suggesting HUMA successfully creates humanlike multi-user conversational experiences.

Abstract: Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.
  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.

*Xiaoyun Jin,Mirjam Ernestus,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study shows that semantic meaning, not just lexical identity, significantly influences pitch contours in Mandarin monosyllabic words, challenging traditional tone theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how word meanings affect pitch contours in spontaneous Mandarin conversation, going beyond traditional phonological explanations of tone.

Method: Used generalized additive models to decompose pitch contours, controlling for variables like duration, gender, and tonal context, and tested semantic predictors including word sense and contextualized embeddings.

Result: Word sense was a better predictor than word identity alone, heterographic homophones had different pitch contours, and contextualized embeddings could predict pitch contours better than chance.

Conclusion: Semantic factors significantly influence tonal realization in Mandarin, supporting the Discriminative Lexicon Model framework over standard tone theories.

Abstract: We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust natural language inference method that avoids textual biases and surface heuristics by grounding language in visual contexts.

Method: Generate visual representations of premises using text-to-image models, then perform inference through two techniques: cosine similarity comparison and visual question answering between visual representations and textual hypotheses.

Result: Achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning and demonstrates robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Validated using a controlled adversarial dataset.

Conclusion: Using visual modality as meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

TL;DR: Selective RoPE introduces input-dependent rotary position embeddings that generalize RoPE, enabling arbitrary rotation angles in both linear and softmax transformers, improving performance on language modeling and sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the benefits of selectivity (shown to improve language tasks) with position encoding, inspired by how selective gating in linear transformers decays past associations while RoPE uses fixed rotations.

Method: Developed Selective RoPE as an input-dependent rotary embedding mechanism that generalizes RoPE, allowing rotation in arbitrary angles. Showed softmax attention performs hidden rotations on query-key pairs and analyzed how real/imaginary parts handle forgetting and position encoding in state-space models.

Result: Equipping gated transformers with Selective RoPE demonstrated improved performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

Conclusion: Selective RoPE successfully bridges selective mechanisms with position encoding, revealing implicit positional structures in attention and providing a more flexible, input-dependent approach to position encoding that enhances transformer performance.

Abstract: Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReVeL framework converts multiple-choice questions to open-form questions to address option leakage issues in MCQA, improving training data efficiency and evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) suffers from option leakage that makes accuracy metrics unreliable and encourages answer guessing behaviors during reinforcement fine-tuning.

Method: Proposed ReVeL framework that rewrites MCQA into open-form questions with different rewriting and verification schemes based on answer types, then uses GRPO to finetune models.

Result: Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on benchmarks while improving OpenQA accuracy by ~6 percentage points, revealing up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReVeL provides more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training, improves judging accuracy, and reduces cost and latency for evaluation.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.

*Shrikant Kendre,Austin Xu,Honglu Zhou,Michael Ryoo,Shafiq Joty,Juan Carlos Niebles*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMILE is a new evaluation metric that combines sentence-level and keyword-level semantic understanding with lexical exactness to better assess QA systems, outperforming traditional metrics in correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like ROUGE and EM focus too much on lexical similarity and miss semantic understanding, while BERTScore and MoverScore lack flexibility and ignore lexical similarity. LLM-based evaluators have high costs and reliability issues.

Method: SMILE integrates sentence-level semantic understanding, keyword-level semantic understanding, and easy keyword matching in a composite approach that balances lexical precision and semantic relevance.

Result: Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE achieves high correlation with human judgments while being computationally lightweight.

Conclusion: SMILE effectively bridges the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation, providing a comprehensive and efficient metric for QA system assessment.

Abstract: Traditional evaluation metrics for textual and visual question answering, like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match (EM), focus heavily on n-gram based lexical similarity, often missing the deeper semantic understanding needed for accurate assessment. While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.

*Zhen Wang,Zhifeng Gao,Guolin Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-RLVR improves mathematical reasoning in LLMs by using masked-and-reordered self-supervised rewards to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning steps, achieving significant performance gains over standard RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR has limited scalability for mathematical reasoning tasks like theorem proving where intermediate reasoning is crucial but final answers are difficult to verify directly. Token-level SFT often leads to rote memorization rather than genuine reasoning.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Self-supervised training using "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to create process-level rewards from mathematical calculation and proof data; 2) RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable.

Result: Implemented on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, MR-RLVR achieved average relative gains over original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8 on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals effectively enhances RLVR's scalability and performance in outcome-verifiable settings, demonstrating the value of leveraging intermediate reasoning steps.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using persistent homology from topological data analysis to objectively differentiate artistic styles between artists and detect AI-generated art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional art style identification relies on subjective expert analysis; this work aims to provide objective, mathematical methods for style differentiation using topological data analysis.

Method: Applied persistent homology (PH) from topological data analysis to analyze artistic styles, enabling statistical differentiation between artists and detection of AI-generated images.

Result: PH can statistically differentiate between artists from different artistic currents and same currents, and distinguish artist's original work from AI-generated images in their style.

Conclusion: Persistent homology provides objective, interpretable insights for artistic style analysis and can reliably detect AI-generated art mimicking human artists.

Abstract: Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed method generates diverse macaque monkey facial expressions using StyleGAN2 with data augmentation, sample selection, and loss refinement to overcome limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited training images for animal faces, especially macaque monkeys, with insufficient quantity and variation in facial expressions across individuals.

Method: Used StyleGAN2 with three approaches: 1) Data augmentation via motion transfer to animate still images, 2) Sample selection based on latent representations for uniform training dataset, 3) Loss function refinement for accurate eye movement reproduction.

Result: Generated diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained only on original still images. Effective for style-based image editing with specific style parameters corresponding to distinct facial movements.

Conclusion: Model successfully disentangles motion components as style parameters, providing valuable tool for macaque facial expression research.

Abstract: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised autoencoder with CDF 97 wavelet transform for denoising neutron images degraded by mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise, showing superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron imaging is crucial for analyzing ICF events but images are often degraded by mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise that conventional methods struggle to remove while preserving image fidelity. Recent advances in synthetic data enable ML approaches.

Method: Implemented an unsupervised autoencoder with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising of neutron imaging data.

Result: The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data with lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics compared to non-ML methods like BM3D filtering.

Conclusion: This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

Motivation: To advance promptable concept segmentation (PCS) by creating a unified model that can handle various concept prompts and improve accuracy over existing systems.

Method: Built a scalable data engine producing 4M unique concept labels dataset, developed an image-level detector and memory-based video tracker with shared backbone, and decoupled recognition/localization using a presence head.

Result: SAM 3 doubles accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SAM 3 represents a significant advancement in promptable concept segmentation, with open-sourced model and new SA-Co benchmark for the community.

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

TL;DR: SaFeR-CLIP is a fine-tuning framework that improves vision-language model safety by redirecting unsafe concepts to semantically closest safe alternatives, minimizing representational disruption and recovering up to 8.0% zero-shot accuracy over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety fine-tuning methods for vision-language models like CLIP cause significant performance drops due to rigid alignment strategies that disrupt learned semantic structures by forcing unsafe concepts to single predefined safe targets.

Method: Proposed proximity-aware approach that redirects unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change, implemented in SaFeR-CLIP framework with minimal intervention principle.

Result: SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. Also introduced NSFW-Caps benchmark with 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift.

Conclusion: Respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance in vision-language models.

Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage framework for generating multi-view consistent SVGs from single-view input using 3D lifting, spatial memory mechanisms, and path optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGs are essential for modern design but generating multi-view consistent SVGs from single-view input remains challenging and underexplored.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Lift rasterized input to 3D and render multi-view images, 2) Extend SAM2's temporal memory to spatial domain for part-level correspondences, 3) Path consolidation and structural optimization during raster-to-vector conversion.

Result: Produces multi-view SVGs with strong geometric and color consistency, reduced redundant paths, and preserved fine structural details without retraining.

Conclusion: Bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, enabling scalable multi-view SVG generation for asset creation and semantic vector editing.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are central to modern design workflows, offering scaling without distortion and precise editability. However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.

TL;DR: Mesh RAG is a training-free framework that enhances autoregressive mesh generation by using retrieval-based component generation, improving quality, speed, and enabling incremental editing without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual mesh creation is time-intensive, and current autoregressive models face quality-speed trade-offs and sequential dependency limitations that complicate incremental editing.

Method: Leverages point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components, decoupling generation from sequential dependencies.

Result: Significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing across various autoregressive mesh generation models.

Conclusion: Mesh RAG provides an effective training-free solution to overcome sequential limitations in autoregressive mesh generation, offering improved quality, speed, and editing capabilities.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EO datasets focus on semantic tasks like captioning/classification but lack benchmarks connecting multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables for scientific regression.

Method: Created REO-Instruct dataset integrating co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated through hybrid human-AI pipeline, establishing cognitive logic chain in forest ecology.

Result: Evaluation shows current VLMs struggle with numeric reasoning, revealing essential challenge for scientific VLMs in handling both descriptive and regression tasks.

Conclusion: REO-Instruct provides standardized foundation for developing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference in Earth Observation.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision language models (VLMs) has enabled remarkable perception and reasoning capabilities, yet their potential for scientific regression in Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO.

TL;DR: BOP-ASK is a large-scale dataset for object interaction reasoning that addresses limitations in current spatial reasoning benchmarks by providing fine-grained annotations for precise 3D localization, physical compatibility, affordances, and multi-step spatial planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform well on high-level spatial relationships but lack fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real-world applications like precise 3D localization, physical compatibility, affordances, and multi-step planning.

Method: Leveraged 6D object poses from BOP datasets to create fine-grained annotations including grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, and spatial relationships. Generated over 150k images and 33M QA pairs spanning six tasks.

Result: Models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and show emergent capabilities in precise object/grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained spatial reasoning in cluttered environments.

Conclusion: BOP-ASK provides a comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluating VLMs on fine-grained object interaction reasoning, addressing critical gaps in current spatial understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parts-Mamba: A hybrid GCN-Mamba model for skeleton action recognition that addresses missing skeleton parts by capturing distant joint context through parts-specific scanning and fusion modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCN models perform poorly with imperfect skeletons due to occlusions or missing frames, as they lack the ability to capture contextual information from distant joints when local context is missing.

Method: Proposed Parts-Mamba model combines GCN with Mamba architecture, using parts-specific scanning features to capture part-specific information and a parts-body fusion module to preserve non-neighboring joint context.

Result: Achieved up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy on NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid GCN-Mamba approach effectively handles imperfect skeletons by maintaining contextual information from distant joints, significantly improving performance in real-world scenarios with occlusions.

Abstract: Skeleton action recognition involves recognizing human action from human skeletons. The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.

*Aryan Tajmir Riahi,Khanh Dao Duc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) to extend GW distance for simultaneous matching between collections of objects, enabling multiple-to-one and multiple-to-multiple matching scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gromov-Wasserstein distance is limited to pairwise matching between single objects, which restricts its utility in applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching.

Method: Extends GW framework to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects, formulates JGW objective as a non-negative dissimilarity measure, and adapts traditional Optimal Transport algorithms with entropic regularization for point cloud representations.

Result: JGW shows superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other GW variants for partial matching, and effectively handles multiple shape matching on both synthetic and real-world datasets including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes.

Conclusion: JGW provides a promising framework for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains like computer graphics and structural biology by enabling simultaneous matching between collections of objects.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.

*Loukas Sfountouris,Giannis Daras,Paris Giampouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REPA (REpresentation Alignment) improves inverse problem solving by aligning diffusion/flow model representations with pretrained self-supervised encoders like DINOv2, enhancing reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inverse problem solving where pretrained generative models serve as priors, by leveraging representation alignment between generative models and self-supervised encoders to guide reconstruction.

Method: Apply REPA between diffusion/flow models and pretrained self-supervised visual encoders (e.g., DINOv2) during inference, using representation alignment as regularization even without ground-truth signals.

Result: Substantially improved reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism across super-resolution, inpainting, deblurring tasks, with efficiency gains through reduced discretization steps.

Conclusion: REPA provides an effective inductive bias for inverse problems, consistently enhancing reconstruction quality while offering theoretical insights into representation steering and practical efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

*Tao Yan,Hao Huang,Yiwei Lu,Zeyu Wang,Ke Xu,Yinghui Wang,Xiaojun Chang,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NFGlassNet is a novel glass surface detection method that uses flash/no-flash image pairs to exploit reflection dynamics, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing glass detection methods rely on boundary or reflection cues but fail to fully exploit intrinsic glass properties. The paper observes that illumination differences across glass surfaces create distinct reflection patterns in flash/no-flash scenarios.

Method: Proposes NFGlassNet with Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) to extract reflections and Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) to fuse reflection and glass surface features. Uses a dataset of 3.3K flash/no-flash image pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art glass surface detection methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging reflection dynamics in flash/no-flash imagery provides an effective approach for accurate glass surface detection, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Conclusion: R-AVST is the first dataset for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel approach for future challenges in this domain.

Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

*Hao-Chien Hsueh,Chi-En Yen,Wen-Hsiao Peng,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Warm Diffusion bridges hot diffusion (pure noise) and cold diffusion (pure blurring) by proposing a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model that jointly controls blurring and noise, exploiting spectral dependencies in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hot diffusion fails to exploit correlation between high-frequency detail and low-frequency structures, while cold diffusion neglects the role of noise in shaping the data manifold, causing out-of-manifold issues.

Method: Proposed Warm Diffusion with Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), using divide-and-conquer strategy to disentangle denoising and deblurring processes via spectral dependency analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the approach for image generation.

Conclusion: Warm Diffusion successfully integrates strengths of both hot and cold diffusion paradigms through joint blur-noise control and spectral analysis.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality assessment methods provide only single scores, which are too coarse to guide model improvement. Fine-grained evaluation along realism and plausibility dimensions is needed for better generative model optimization.

Method: Created Q-Real dataset with 3,088 AI-generated images annotated with entity locations, judgment questions, and attribution descriptions. Built Q-Real Bench benchmark for MLLM evaluation on judgment and grounding tasks, and designed a fine-tuning framework.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of the dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: Q-Real enables fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images along realism and plausibility dimensions, providing targeted guidance for improving generative models through MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniModel is a unified pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework that handles both visual understanding and generation tasks by treating all inputs and outputs as RGB pixels in a shared visual space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve unification across models, tasks, and representations by eliminating modality discrepancies and creating a fully vision-native multimodal learning framework.

Method: Maps text and images into a shared visual space where text prompts are rendered as painted text images, uses a Unified Diffusion Transformer with rectified flow in pixel space, and employs lightweight task embeddings to specify direction.

Result: Demonstrates strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability, including cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops, in both text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeltaDeno is a zero-shot anomaly generation method that creates realistic defects without training or real anomaly samples by contrasting diffusion branches and using token-level prompt refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly generation methods require fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity of anomalies and leads to overfitting category priors.

Method: Uses two diffusion branches with minimal prompt pairs under shared schedule, accumulates denoising deltas for localization, performs token-level prompt refinement, and applies spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens.

Result: Achieves great generation quality, realism, and consistent gains in downstream detection performance on public datasets.

Conclusion: DeltaDeno provides an effective training-free zero-shot approach for anomaly generation that overcomes the limitations of existing methods requiring anomalous samples.

Abstract: Anomaly generation is often framed as few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity that motivates generation and tends to overfit category priors. We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance. Code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DM-based VSR methods suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and trade-offs between perceptual quality and fidelity due to inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames.

Method: Proposes DGAF-VSR with Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to preserve high-frequency details in aligned features and Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) for dense guidance in feature domain.

Result: Achieves 35.82% DISTS reduction (perceptual quality), 0.20 dB PSNR gain (fidelity), and 30.37% tLPIPS reduction (temporal consistency) on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Feature domain alignment and compensation with dense guidance significantly improves VSR performance across perceptual quality, fidelity, and temporal consistency metrics.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

  Methods:
  To address this, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates semantic and shape awareness for shape-preserving segmentation. Our method introduces a target-tooth-centroid prompted multi-label learning strategy to model semantic relationships between teeth, reducing shape ambiguity. Additionally, a tooth-shape-aware learning mechanism explicitly enforces morphological constraints to preserve boundary integrity. These components are unified via multi-task learning, jointly optimizing segmentation and shape preservation.

Motivation: Current STVG models face limitations due to restricted benchmark scope, leading to category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness when handling diverse objects and complex real-world queries.

Method: Introduced Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline combining multi-directional tracking with error correction; proposed DeepSTG evaluation framework; developed PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework that decomposes STVG into temporal grounding and spatio-temporal propagation.

Result: Performance drops 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, especially with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: OmniGround addresses critical gaps in STVG evaluation, and PG-TAF demonstrates effective decomposition of the task into temporal and spatial components, achieving substantial performance improvements on complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

TL;DR: MultiPriv is the first benchmark for evaluating individual-level privacy reasoning in Vision-Language Models, revealing significant unmeasured privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks are insufficient for modern VLMs as they only evaluate privacy perception but fail to address the critical risk of privacy reasoning - VLMs' ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles.

Method: Proposed the Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR) framework and constructed a bilingual multimodal dataset with synthetic individual profiles where identifiers are linked to sensitive attributes. Designed nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum.

Result: Evaluation of 50+ VLMs revealed: (1) significant unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks, (2) perception-level metrics are poor predictors of reasoning risks, and (3) existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against reasoning-based attacks.

Conclusion: MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving models by addressing the critical gap in privacy reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel implicit neural representation framework that jointly models dynamic MRI images and motion fields using coupled INRs with physics-inspired flow regularization, enabling simultaneous high-quality reconstruction and motion estimation without prior flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic MRI faces challenges from limited sampling and motion artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated methods rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality.

Method: Two coupled implicit neural representations (INRs): one for spatiotemporal image content and another for optical flow, connected via optical flow equation as physics-inspired regularization, plus data consistency loss with k-space measurements.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches on cardiac MRI datasets, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: The implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints shows strong potential for advancing dynamic MRI reconstruction by enabling simultaneous recovery of coherent images and motion fields.

Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) captures temporally-resolved anatomy but is often challenged by limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: FingerCap introduces finger-level hand motion captioning using a new dataset (FingerCap-40K) and FiGOP method that combines RGB frames with hand keypoints to capture fine finger motions, outperforming existing Video-MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental for visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication, but current methods struggle with capturing subtle finger-level dynamics.

Method: Proposed FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures) that pairs RGB keyframes with subsequent hand keypoints until next keyframe, using a lightweight temporal encoder to convert keypoints into motion embeddings integrated with RGB features.

Result: Experiments show strong Video-MLLMs struggle with finger-level reasoning, while FiGOP-augmented model achieves consistent gains under HandJudge evaluation and human studies.

Conclusion: FiGOP effectively addresses temporal sparsity in Video-MLLMs for fine finger motion capture without increasing RGB density, enabling better finger-level hand motion understanding.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication. In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.

*Yicheng Deng,Hideaki Hayashi,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a point-supervised facial expression spotting framework using Gaussian-based intensity modeling and two-branch architecture for macro/micro-expression detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require costly temporal boundary annotations; this work explores point supervision with only single timestamp annotations per instance.

Method: Two-branch framework: 1) Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling for soft pseudo-labeling, 2) Class-aware apex classification branch. Uses intensity-aware contrastive loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses point-supervised facial expression spotting with reliable intensity supervision and accurate classification.

Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neighbor GRPO is a new alignment algorithm for flow matching models that bypasses SDE conversion by perturbing initial noise conditions and using distance-based optimization, offering better efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers than SDE-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDE-based GRPO methods for flow matching models suffer from inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for few-step sampling, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: Proposed Neighbor GRPO generates diverse candidate trajectories by perturbing initial noise conditions of ODEs and optimizes using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy, with symmetric anchor sampling and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting.

Result: Extensive experiments show Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

Conclusion: Neighbor GRPO provides an effective alignment method for flow matching models that preserves deterministic ODE sampling advantages while overcoming limitations of SDE-based approaches.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PBR material creation is labor-intensive and existing generative methods lack unified representations, leading to fragmented pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data.

Method: Uses a novel joint RGB-PBR representation encoding materials into two interdependent latents (RGB appearance and PBR maps), formulated as a 5-frame sequence and trained with video diffusion architectures on MatHybrid-410K dataset.

Result: Achieves native 1024×1024 synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity across multiple material tasks.

Conclusion: MatPedia provides a unified framework for PBR material synthesis that bridges natural image appearance with physical properties, enabling efficient material generation and decomposition tasks.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials are fundamental to photorealistic graphics, yet their creation remains labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: Proposes a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network for blind super-resolution that handles both blur and noise degradation through separate embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods perform poorly when actual degradation deviates from assumed fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling), especially in blind SR scenarios where degradation is unknown.

Method: Uses a dual branch network to extract unsupervised degradation embeddings representing blurry and noisy information separately, treating the degradation extractor as a regularizer to leverage differences between SR and HR images.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in blind super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed dual branch degradation extraction approach effectively handles blind SR problems by separately modeling blur and noise degradation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Previous methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with known and fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information. The SR network can then be adapted to blur embedding and noise embedding in distinct ways. Furthermore, we treat the degradation extractor as a regularizer to capitalize on differences between SR and HR images. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves SOTA performance in the blind SR problem.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines with significant FID score improvements: 30% on their dataset and 60% on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables realistic food image synthesis on edge devices with user-preferred visual targets, ensuring temporal consistency and culinary plausibility.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)

TL;DR: SeeCLIP improves open-set domain generalization by using semantic-enhanced prompts and duplex contrastive learning to better distinguish hard unknown classes that resemble known classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with the trade-off between known-class structural risk and unknown-class open-space risk, particularly when dealing with hard unknowns that have fine-grained visual similarities to known classes.

Method: Proposes semantic-aware prompt enhancement to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, duplex contrastive learning with repulsion and cohesion objectives, and semantic-guided diffusion to synthesize challenging pseudo-unknowns.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: The semantic enhancement approach effectively addresses the dilemma in open-set domain generalization by enabling finer vision-language alignment and generating hard negatives for better decision boundaries.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) uses many Gaussian primitives, causing high storage and computational costs. Existing pruning methods rely on manual criteria or extra parameters, producing suboptimal results.

Method: Proposes a natural selection-inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field on opacity, allowing optimization gradients to autonomously determine pruning. Also introduces opacity decay with finite opacity prior to accelerate selection.

Result: Achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain compared to 3DGS under 15% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a fully learnable pruning approach that requires no human intervention and significantly improves compact 3DGS performance through natural selection-inspired optimization.

Abstract: 3DGS employs a large number of Gaussian primitives to fit scenes, resulting in substantial storage and computational overhead. Existing pruning methods rely on manually designed criteria or introduce additional learnable parameters, yielding suboptimal results. To address this, we propose an natural selection inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing the optimization gradients--driven by the goal of maximizing rendering quality--to autonomously determine which Gaussians to retain or prune. This process is fully learnable and requires no human intervention. We further introduce an opacity decay technique with a finite opacity prior, which accelerates the selection process without compromising pruning effectiveness. Compared to 3DGS, our method achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15\% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS. Project page https://xiaobin2001.github.io/GNS-web.

Result: SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy compared to existing diversity metrics.

Conclusion: The SQ framework enables more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection by better capturing ensemble member synergy for optimal team selection.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.

Motivation: Complex radio propagation behavior and challenging environments make radiomap estimation difficult, requiring better methods to handle spatial signal knowledge for wireless network management.

Method: Proposed RadioKMoE framework with KAN module for initial coarse coverage map prediction using physics model approximation, followed by MoE network with specialized expert networks for distinct radiomap patterns to refine local details while maintaining global consistency.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced accuracy and robustness in both multi- and single-band radiomap estimation compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The RadioKMoE framework effectively addresses radiomap estimation challenges by integrating KAN's physics modeling capabilities with MoE's pattern specialization, providing a robust solution for wireless network management.

Abstract: Radiomap serves as a vital tool for wireless network management and deployment by providing powerful spatial knowledge of signal propagation and coverage. However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns. The initial coarse map, together with environmental information, drives our MoE network for precise radiomap estimation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, the MoE module comprises expert networks specializing in distinct radiomap patterns to improve local details while preserving global consistency. Experimental results in both multi- and single-band RME demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the proposed RadioKMoE in radiomap estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether language information is necessary for visual complexity prediction, challenging the recent trend of multimodal approaches and exploring if visual features alone are sufficient.

Method: Proposes DReX architecture that fuses multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16 through a learnable attention mechanism.

Result: Achieves SOTA on IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r=0.9581), surpassing multimodal methods while using 21.5x fewer parameters. Generalizes well across datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: Visual features alone are sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction, and properly fused self-supervised transformers and supervised CNNs offer complementary benefits for this task.

Abstract: Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation models are passive and only estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive desired depths in layered scenes with transmissive materials.

Method: A steerable Vision Transformer conditioned on a scalar depth preference that dynamically adapts its computation to focus on intended depth layers, trained primarily on a new 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset capturing diverse see-through effects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional benchmarks (BOOSTER), demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on new multi-depth datasets, and shows strong generalization on unseen see-through scenes.

Conclusion: DepthFocus represents a significant step toward active, human-like 3D perception by enabling selective depth perception in complex layered scenes.

Abstract: Depth in the real world is rarely singular. Transmissive materials create layered ambiguities that confound conventional perception systems. Existing models remain passive, attempting to estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive a desired depth. We introduce DepthFocus, a steerable Vision Transformer that redefines stereo depth estimation as intent-driven control. Conditioned on a scalar depth preference, the model dynamically adapts its computation to focus on the intended depth, enabling selective perception within complex scenes. The training primarily leverages our newly constructed 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset, designed to capture diverse see-through effects. DepthFocus not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks like BOOSTER, a dataset notably rich in transparent and reflective objects, but also quantitatively demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on our newly proposed real and synthetic multi-depth datasets. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen see-through scenes, underscoring its robustness as a significant step toward active and human-like 3D perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions is crucial for autonomous driving and outdoor robots, but challenging due to diverse degradation patterns.

Method: Combines lightweight encoder-decoder with Visual-Language Model for chain-of-thought weather reasoning and Implicit Memory Bank storing degradation patterns, using cross-attention for adaptive feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines on four severe-weather benchmarks in PSNR and SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: MVLR achieves practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness, suitable for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

Abstract: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM evaluations overlook scenarios with multiple cultural cues, failing to test model stability across diverse cultural inputs which is crucial for supporting multicultural societies.

Method: Introduced ConfusedTourist suite with image-stacking perturbations and image-generation-based variants to test VLM stability against perturbed geographical cues, with interpretability analyses.

Result: VLMs show critical vulnerability with heavy accuracy drops under simple perturbations, worsened by image-generation variants, due to systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues.

Conclusion: Visual cultural concept mixing substantially impairs even state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: FLUID is a training-free face de-identification framework that substitutes identities in diffusion model latent space using chemical-inspired semantic displacement with novel reagent losses for attribute preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective face de-identification method that achieves superior balance between identity suppression and attribute preservation without requiring model retraining.

Method: Uses identity editing as semantic displacement in pretrained diffusion model's latent h-space, discovers editing directions via optimization with novel reagent losses, and proposes linear and geodesic editing schemes for latent manifold navigation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art de-identification methods on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets in both qualitative and quantitative metrics, achieving superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation.

Conclusion: FLUID provides an effective training-free solution for face de-identification that successfully balances identity removal with attribute retention through latent space manipulation in diffusion models.

Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

*Lingyan Ruan,Bin Chen,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for realistic lens blur compositing in mixed reality that estimates circle of confusion maps directly from RGB images without requiring camera parameters or scene depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lens blur compositing methods require camera parameters and scene depth, which are often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting accessibility and generalizability.

Method: Directly estimate CoC map from RGB images, infer CoC values for virtual objects using linear relationship between signed CoC and depth, and render realistic blur with neural reblurring network.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Provides flexible and practical solution for real-world mixed reality applications without requiring camera metadata or depth information.

Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: RoomPlanner is the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework that creates realistic indoor scenes from short text prompts without manual layout design or panoramic images, achieving generation times under 30 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable painless creation of realistic 3D indoor scenes using only short text input, eliminating the need for manual layout design or panoramic image guidance that existing methods require.

Method: Uses hierarchical language-driven agent planners to parse ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions, initializes 3D point clouds, implements arrangement constraints for collision-free layouts, and employs AnyReach Sampling and Interval Timestep Flow Sampling for efficient rendering optimization.

Result: Generates geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes that surpass prior approaches in rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability, with generation times reduced to under 30 minutes.

Conclusion: RoomPlanner provides an effective automatic solution for 3D room generation from text, demonstrating superior performance in speed and quality compared to existing methods while maintaining scene editability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RoomPlanner, the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework for painlessly creating realistic indoor scenes with only short text as input. Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathAgent is a training-free LLM-based agent framework that emulates pathologists' stepwise reasoning process for analyzing whole-slide images, providing fully interpretable predictions through explicit chain-of-thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational pipelines for whole-slide image analysis lack explicit reasoning trajectories, resulting in opaque and unjustifiable predictions, unlike human pathologists' iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process.

Method: PathAgent uses three modules: Navigator for iteratively locating significant micro-regions, Perceptor for extracting morphology visual cues, and Executor for integrating findings into natural language trajectories, forming an explicit chain-of-thought.

Result: PathAgent demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across five datasets, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks, and shows promise as a transparent diagnostic assistant in human evaluations.

Conclusion: PathAgent successfully bridges the gap between human pathologists' reasoning process and computational analysis, providing interpretable predictions through explicit reasoning trajectories and showing clinical promise as a diagnostic assistant.

Abstract: Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

*Teng Fu,Mengyang Zhao,Ke Niu,Kaixin Peng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniPT is a unified pedestrian tracking framework using LVLMs that can track, reference-based track, and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs excel at semantic understanding but lag behind expert models in instance-level tasks like pedestrian tracking. New tracking tasks require advanced semantic understanding, which LVLMs can provide.

Method: Three-phase training: RL for bounding box format, mid-training on pedestrian datasets, SFT on tracking datasets, and final RL to improve tracking and instruction following.

Result: Experimental results on tracking benchmarks show the proposed method performs better than previous methods.

Conclusion: OmniPT successfully bridges the gap between LVLMs and instance-level tracking tasks, demonstrating superior performance in pedestrian tracking with semantic understanding capabilities.

Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

TL;DR: RL-AD-Net is a reinforcement learning framework that refines point cloud completions in latent space to improve local geometric consistency, using a pretrained autoencoder and selective refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion models generate globally plausible shapes but often have local geometric inconsistencies that need refinement.

Method: Uses RL in latent space of pretrained autoencoder with GFVs, guided by Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics, plus PointNN selector for robust refinement.

Result: Consistently improves completions across both training-style and random cropping scenarios on ShapeNetCore-2048, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: RL-AD-Net provides effective, lightweight, model-agnostic refinement that enhances geometric fidelity without requiring retraining of completion networks.

Abstract: Recent point cloud completion models, including transformer-based, denoising-based, and other state-of-the-art approaches, generate globally plausible shapes from partial inputs but often leave local geometric inconsistencies. We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REArtGS struggles with screw-joint/multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states, limiting generalizable articulated object reconstruction.

Method: Models decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, optimizes part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters via part motion blending, and introduces temporal geometry constraints through planar Gaussian regularization and Taylor expansion.

Result: Superior performance in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: REArtGS++ successfully addresses limitations of previous methods by incorporating temporal geometry constraints and planar Gaussian splatting for more robust articulated object reconstruction.

Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: ReBrain is a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework that synthesizes brain MRI from sparse CT scans using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model and reference-guided generation via ControlNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is crucial for brain disease diagnosis but not always feasible due to physical/clinical constraints. Existing CT-to-MRI synthesis methods struggle with highly sparse CT volumes from low-dose protocols, making accurate full brain MRI reconstruction challenging.

Method: Proposed ReBrain framework: 1) Uses Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model to synthesize MRI slices from sparse 3D CT scans, 2) Retrieves similar CT slices from database via fine-tuned retrieval model, 3) Incorporates retrieved slices as references through ControlNet branch to guide generation and ensure structural continuity, 4) Handles rare retrieval failures with spherical linear interpolation.

Result: Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal MRI reconstruction under sparse CT conditions.

Conclusion: ReBrain effectively addresses the challenge of synthesizing full brain MRI volumes from highly sparse CT scans through retrieval-augmented diffusion framework, achieving superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from diversity collapse (reduced output variability) similar to few-step distilled diffusion models, despite their efficiency advantages over traditional AR and diffusion models.

Method: Suppress pivotal components in model input and amplify them in model output to unlock inherent generative potential without requiring additional training.

Result: Substantially enhances generative diversity with negligible performance influences, preserving high-fidelity synthesis.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR effectively addresses diversity collapse in VAR models through a simple yet effective training-free approach that maintains efficiency and image quality while restoring output variability.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently garnered significant attention for their innovative next-scale prediction paradigm, offering notable advantages in both inference efficiency and image quality compared to traditional multi-step autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences.

TL;DR: STAR modeling uses spanning tree traversal orders to maintain sampling performance while enabling flexible sequence orders for image editing, overcoming limitations of random permutations in autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance decline or inflexibility issues in conventional autoregressive models when using random permutations for bidirectional context in visual generation.

Method: Utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled from image patch lattices, obtained through breadth-first search and rejection sampling to ensure connected partial observations appear as prefixes.

Result: Preserves postfix completion capability while maintaining sampling performance without significant architectural changes to standard language AR models.

Conclusion: STAR provides a tailored yet structured randomized strategy that balances sampling performance with flexible sequence order choice for image editing tasks.

Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing articulated object reconstruction methods require costly multi-stage and multi-view observations, limiting practical applications.

Method: Uses planar Gaussian Splatting with Gaussian information field for viewpoint selection, compresses 3D Gaussians to planar Gaussians for normal/depth estimation, optimizes with depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion, and incorporates part segmentation via back-projection.

Result: Achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconstructs articulated objects from sparse-view RGB images with improved quality and reduced input requirements.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free VAD methods rely on dense frame-level inference, which incurs high computational costs and latency. The paper questions whether dense reasoning is truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models.

Method: ReCoVAD uses a dual-pathway approach: (1) Reflex pathway with lightweight CLIP-based module for fast response using dynamic memory, and (2) Conscious pathway with medium-scale vision-language model for refined analysis and prototype updates, plus integrated LLM for periodic review.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55% of frames on UCF-Crime and 16.04% on XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective VAD.

Conclusion: Sparse reasoning with selective frame processing is sufficient for effective large-model-based video anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Yu Zhou,Can Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PACL uses text knowledge to bridge the affective gap in visual emotion recognition by separating samples and applying distinct contrastive learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained visual models lack direct association between features and emotions (affective gap), while text models have explicit emotional expression.

Method: Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) separates sample types and uses distinct contrastive learning strategies to leverage image-text emotional connections.

Result: Bridging the affective gap significantly improves performance of pre-trained visual models in emotion-related tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging text knowledge through PACL effectively enhances visual emotion recognition by addressing the affective gap.

Abstract: Visual emotion recognition (VER) is a longstanding field that has garnered increasing attention with the advancement of deep neural networks. Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/wdqqdw/PACL.

Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models exhibit redundant self-reflection in lengthy reasoning chains, and existing CoT compression methods for LLMs don't work well for multimodal tasks due to static visual references.

Method: ChainV performs coarse visual patch selection based on previous reasoning steps, refines it using attention intensity to find representative atomic visual hints, evaluates hint reliability with consistency-based mechanism, and incorporates pixel coordinates with Bernoulli stochastic process.

Result: ChainV significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, achieving 2.3% improvement on MathVista benchmark while reducing inference latency by 51.4% and shortening output token length by 24.5%.

Conclusion: Dynamic integration of visual hints through ChainV framework effectively optimizes multimodal reasoning by making it more concise and accurate, especially for math-intensive tasks requiring multi-step symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales is challenging due to modeling limitations, severe motion blur, and lack of physical consistency.

Method: Integrates physical priors with event stream enhancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline; uses triple-level supervision with acceleration constraint, event stream guidance, and Kalman regularizer; implements motion-aware simulated annealing training strategy.

Result: Superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods; contributes first RGB-Event paired dataset for natural fast rigid motion.

Conclusion: PEGS framework effectively addresses motion reconstruction challenges through physical priors, event stream enhancement, and adaptive training strategies.

Abstract: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

TL;DR: SketchVerify is a training-free framework that improves video generation by planning and verifying motion trajectories before synthesis, using sketch-based rendering and vision-language verification for better physical plausibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods use single-shot plans limited to simple motions or iterative refinement that requires multiple expensive diffusion calls. There's a need for better motion planning that ensures physical plausibility and instruction consistency without high computational costs.

Method: Proposes a sketch-verification-based planning framework that: 1) Predicts multiple candidate motion plans, 2) Ranks them using a vision-language verifier for semantic alignment and physical plausibility, 3) Renders trajectories as lightweight video sketches over static backgrounds, 4) Iteratively refines plans until satisfactory, then passes to trajectory-conditioned generator.

Result: Significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench compared to baselines, while being substantially more efficient. Scaling trajectory candidates consistently enhances performance.

Conclusion: SketchVerify provides an effective training-free approach for generating dynamically coherent trajectories that improve video generation quality and efficiency through sketch-based verification and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

*SaiKiran Tedla,Joshua E. Little,Hakki Can Karaimer,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes replacing traditional 1D CCT-based colorimetric mapping with a 2D chromaticity approach using a lightweight MLP, significantly improving color accuracy for modern LED lighting while maintaining compatibility with traditional illuminants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LED lighting often deviates from the Planckian locus, making traditional CCT-based colorimetric mapping inaccurate for these non-Planckian illuminants.

Method: Transition from 1D CCT to 2D chromaticity space and replace CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained using a lightbox-based calibration procedure with representative LED sources.

Result: Reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time deployment with negligible computational cost.

Conclusion: The 2D chromaticity approach with MLP provides superior colorimetric accuracy for modern lighting technologies while being computationally efficient and compatible with existing systems.

Abstract: Traditional in-camera colorimetric mapping relies on correlated color temperature (CCT)-based interpolation between pre-calibrated transforms optimized for Planckian illuminants such as CIE A and D65. However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.

TL;DR: A multi-stage optimization framework for deploying deep learning-based image compression models on FPGAs, addressing quantization issues and hardware constraints through dynamic range-aware quantization and hardware-aware optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying state-of-the-art deep learning image compression models on resource-constrained FPGAs is challenging due to quantization-induced performance degradation and hardware limitations.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) with activation clipping and weight regularization, plus hardware-aware optimizations including progressive mixed-precision search and channel pruning adapted for GDN layers.

Result: DRAQ reduces BD-rate overhead from 30% to 6.3%, and hardware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over 20% with negligible impact on rate-distortion performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between floating-point models and efficient integer implementations, yielding FPGA-based image compression that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image compression (LIC) has achieved state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance, yet deploying these models on resource-constrained FPGAs remains a major challenge. This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

*Yushun Fang,Yuxiang Chen,Shibo Yin,Qiang Hu,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Xiaoyun Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODTSR is a one-step diffusion transformer for real-world image super-resolution that balances fidelity and controllability using a noise-hybrid visual stream design and fidelity-aware adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution methods struggle to balance fidelity and controllability - multi-step methods have low fidelity due to randomness, while one-step methods lack control flexibility.

Method: Uses Qwen-Image based one-step diffusion transformer with Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) that processes low-quality images with adjustable noise and consistent noise in parallel, plus Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) for enhanced controllability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on generic Real-ISR and enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios like Chinese character text image super-resolution without specific dataset training.

Conclusion: ODTSR successfully addresses the fidelity-controllability trade-off in real-world image super-resolution through its novel noise-hybrid design and training approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional loss functions like Dice under-segment small lesions because their small volume contributes negligibly to overall loss, requiring instance-wise approaches.

Method: Proposed CC-DiceCE loss based on CC-Metrics framework, benchmarked against blob loss and DiceCE baseline using nnU-Net framework for standardized evaluation.

Result: CC-DiceCE increases detection recall with minimal degradation in segmentation performance, though slightly more false positives. Outperforms blob loss in multi-dataset study.

Conclusion: CC-DiceCE is an effective instance-wise loss function that improves small lesion detection while maintaining segmentation quality, generally superior to blob loss.

Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in real-time remote sensing detection, particularly for small objects, while balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Uses Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) with local and global branches, Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) with dilated convolutions, and Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN).

Result: Achieves competitive performance on VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets in terms of mAP, model size, and other metrics.

Conclusion: DMG-YOLO effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for real-time small object detection in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.

TL;DR: DiffRefiner: a two-stage trajectory prediction framework combining discriminative trajectory proposals with generative diffusion refinement for autonomous driving


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for trajectory prediction rely on denoising human-crafted anchors or random noise, leaving significant room for improvement in performance and flexibility.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Transformer-based Proposal Decoder generates coarse predictions using predefined trajectory anchors, 2) Diffusion Refiner iteratively denoises and refines initial predictions with fine-grained scene compliance.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, 87.1 DS and 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, setting new records on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiffRefiner enhances diffusion-based planning by incorporating discriminative trajectory proposals, providing strong guidance for generative refinement and achieving superior trajectory prediction performance.

Abstract: Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

TL;DR: UI-Styler is a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework that addresses domain shifts in ultrasound images across devices by preserving source structural content while transferring target texture patterns and ensuring semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound images vary across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. Existing unpaired image translation methods often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation.

Method: UI-Styler uses a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer target texture patterns onto source images while preserving source structural content, and introduces a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain to enforce accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.

Result: Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks show UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks like classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: UI-Styler effectively addresses domain shifts in ultrasound imaging through class-aware style transfer and semantic alignment, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods for cross-device ultrasound image adaptation.

Abstract: The appearance of ultrasound images varies across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories. Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks demonstrate that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wildfire risk prediction methods lack causal reasoning and multimodal understanding needed for reliable generalization across different regions.

Method: Proposed FireScope framework using VLM-based reasoning-to-generation, trained with reinforcement learning and visual supervision on FireScope-Bench dataset containing Sentinel-2 imagery, climate data, and expert-defined risk rasters.

Result: FireScope achieved substantial performance gains when trained in USA and tested in Europe, with expert feedback confirming faithful and semantically meaningful reasoning traces.

Conclusion: Language-based reasoning can ground raster prediction models to improve both generalization and interpretability, enabling robust cross-continental wildfire risk modeling.

Abstract: Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised representations show promise for audio-visual deepfake detection but struggle with cross-dataset generalization despite capturing meaningful patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate self-supervised representations for audio-visual deepfake detection across modalities and domains, as their potential remains underexplored compared to isolated or complex architectural approaches.

Method: Systematic evaluation across three dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability, and cross-modal complementarity, testing across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content).

Result: Most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information that is complementary across modalities, with models attending to semantically meaningful regions rather than artifacts. However, none generalize reliably across datasets due to dataset characteristics rather than superficial pattern learning.

Conclusion: Self-supervised representations learn meaningful patterns for deepfake detection but face fundamental challenges in achieving robust cross-domain performance, exposing both promise and limitations of this approach.

Abstract: Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and LENS-Net framework address nighttime traffic sign recognition challenges through adaptive enhancement and multimodal reasoning, providing robust performance for road safety applications.

Abstract: Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.

Motivation: Existing video recapture methods have suboptimal camera motion injection strategies that limit control precision and fail to preserve fine visual details from source videos.

Method: Introduces a query-shared cross-attention module that integrates 6-DoF camera poses and 2D rendered video frames into a unified representation, using a two-stage training strategy: coarse camera control learning followed by visual information refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: PostCam provides more accurate and flexible motion manipulation for novel-view video generation, significantly improving both control precision and visual fidelity compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage noise-decoupling framework for hyperspectral image denoising that decomposes complex noise into explicit and implicit components, using pre-training and wavelet-guided networks to handle real-world noise effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noise modeling methods struggle with accurately modeling complex real-world noise in hyperspectral images, limiting their effectiveness in denoising applications.

Method: Proposes a multi-stage framework that decouples noise into explicit and implicit components, uses existing noise models for pre-training, introduces high-frequency wavelet guided network for implicit noise, and employs separate pre-training with joint fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and captured datasets show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

Conclusion: The multi-stage noise-decoupling framework successfully addresses complex real-world noise in hyperspectral images through explicit-implicit noise decomposition and multi-stage learning, achieving superior denoising performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

*Hanyu Zhou,Chuanhao Ma,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-4D is a vision-language-action model with 4D awareness that enables spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation through unified 4D visual representations and spatiotemporal action planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models struggle with spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, particularly achieving temporally coherent control over action execution despite embedding 3D positions into visual representations.

Method: Two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation by extracting visual features, embedding time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fusing via cross-attention; 2) Spatiotemporal action representation extending spatial actions with temporal information for planning and aligning multimodal representations in LLM.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority across different robotic manipulation tasks, achieving spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent control.

Conclusion: VLA-4D provides a unified framework that jointly enables spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent robotic manipulation through its 4D-aware representations and spatiotemporal action planning.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models show potential for general robotic tasks, but remain challenging in spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, which requires fine-grained representations. Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: CA-SAM is a continual learning framework that adapts SAM for medical image segmentation using lightweight Alignment Layers to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous privacy policies prevent joint training on pooled medical datasets, and SAM's computational overhead limits practical deployment despite its strong zero-shot capabilities.

Method: Introduces Alignment Layer for feature distribution alignment and CA-SAM framework that automatically adapts these layers for continual learning, leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual learning scenarios while reducing computation.

Conclusion: The SAM paradigm is highly promising for medical segmentation when computational efficiency and performance are balanced through the proposed CA-SAM framework.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, heterogeneous privacy policies across institutions often make joint training on pooled datasets infeasible, motivating continual image segmentation-learning from data streams without catastrophic forgetting. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets. Experimented across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual-learning scenario, CA-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code, models and datasets will be released on \mbox{https://github.com/azzzzyo/Continual-Alignment-for-SAM.}

Motivation: To overcome limitations of current dense 3D reconstruction methods in SLAM, including drift and redundant point maps that reduce efficiency and hinder downstream tasks like novel view synthesis.

Method: Builds locally consistent submaps through lightweight tracking/reconstruction, then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency and provides feedback to correct local drift.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering with over 12% improvement in tracking, produces finer geometry, and maintains compact memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SING3R-SLAM enables efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications by combining local consistency with global refinement through Gaussian representation.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction enable the accurate capture of local geometry; however, integrating them into SLAM is challenging due to drift and redundant point maps, which limit efficiency and downstream tasks, such as novel view synthesis. To address these issues, we propose SING3R-SLAM, a globally consistent and compact Gaussian-based dense RGB SLAM framework. The key idea is to combine locally consistent 3D reconstructions with a unified global Gaussian representation that jointly refines scene geometry and camera poses, enabling efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications. SING3R-SLAM first builds locally consistent submaps through our lightweight tracking and reconstruction module, and then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency. This global map, in turn, provides feedback to correct local drift and enhance the robustness of tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, resulting in over 12% improvement in tracking and producing finer, more detailed geometry, all while maintaining a compact and memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SPECTRE establishes a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging that is both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful.

Abstract: We introduce SPECTRE, a fully transformer-based foundation model for volumetric computed tomography (CT). Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.

*Chaowei Fang,Bolin Fu,De Cheng,Lechao Cheng,Guanbin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Dual-domain Adaptation Networks method that efficiently adapts pre-trained SR models from synthetic to real-world datasets using spatial and frequency domain adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic image SR faces challenges with limited real-world LR-HR data and complex degradation patterns. Pre-trained SR models offer valuable prior knowledge but need effective adaptation to real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Dual-domain Adaptation Networks with spatial-domain adaptation (selective parameter updating + low-rank adaptation) and frequency domain adaptation branch that combines spectral data and spatial features to infer HR frequency maps.

Result: Experimental evaluations on RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts pre-trained SR models to real-world scenarios, improving generalization and reducing the need for extensive real-world data while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing approaches that rely on 2D rendering consistency or discretized voxel grids, which limit spatial precision and scalability in learning 3D scene geometry and semantics without expensive manual annotation.

Method: Uses query-based self-supervised learning with independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames, supporting supervision from pseudo-point clouds or raw lidar data, and employs a contractive scene representation for long-range reasoning under constant memory.

Result: Achieves 26% improvement in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark compared to previous camera-based methods, while maintaining real-time performance at 11.6 FPS.

Conclusion: Direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning, demonstrating superior performance in continuous 3D semantic occupancy estimation without manual labels.

Abstract: Learning 3D scene geometry and semantics from images is a core challenge in computer vision and a key capability for autonomous driving. Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels. Existing approaches either rely on 2D rendering consistency, where 3D structure emerges only implicitly, or on discretized voxel grids from accumulated lidar point clouds, limiting spatial precision and scalability. We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions. QueryOcc surpasses previous camera-based methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while running at 11.6 FPS, demonstrating that direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning. https://research.zenseact.com/publications/queryocc/

Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.
  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.
  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains.

*Yuming Yang,Michael K. Ng,Zhigang Jia,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel quaternion-based blind deconvolution method for color images that preserves inter-channel relationships, outperforming existing approaches that process channels separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing color image blind deconvolution methods either convert to grayscale or process color channels separately, ignoring important inter-channel relationships that affect deblurring quality.

Method: Formulates a quaternion fidelity term using quaternion convolution kernels with four components: one for overall blur and three unconstrained kernels for RGB channel interdependencies, using normalized quaternion kernels to preserve image intensity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real blurred color image datasets show effective artifact removal and significant improvement in deblurring effects compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed quaternion-based approach demonstrates strong potential as an effective tool for color image blind deconvolution by properly modeling color channel relationships.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging problem of blind deconvolution for color images. Existing methods often convert color images to grayscale or process each color channel separately, which overlooking the relationships between color channels. To handle this issue, we formulate a novel quaternion fidelity term designed specifically for color image blind deconvolution. This fidelity term leverages the properties of quaternion convolution kernel, which consists of four kernels: one that functions similarly to a non-negative convolution kernel to capture the overall blur, and three additional convolution kernels without constraints corresponding to red, green and blue channels respectively model their unknown interdependencies. In order to preserve image intensity, we propose to use the normalized quaternion kernel in the blind deconvolution process. Extensive experiments on real datasets of blurred color images show that the proposed method effectively removes artifacts and significantly improves deblurring effect, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for color image deconvolution.

TL;DR: LVLMs suffer from hallucinations due to multiple causal pathways. The paper proposes intervention methods targeting critical hallucination heads in different pathways based on question-answer alignment formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong performance, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination, which arises from the complex interplay of multiple causal pathways rather than a single source.

Method: Comprehensive intervention framework aligned with transformer's causal architecture, identifying and intervening on critical hallucination heads within image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways, tailored to discriminative and generative formats.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent reduction in hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

Conclusion: Hallucinations in LVLMs stem from multiple causal pathways, and targeted interventions on critical heads can effectively mitigate them, with different pathways being important depending on question-answer alignment format.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

TL;DR: The paper proposes relevance feedback mechanisms to improve visual search performance in vision-language models without requiring fine-tuning, including pseudo-relevance feedback, generative relevance feedback, and attentive feedback summarizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve retrieval performance of vision-language models at inference time without needing fine-tuning or larger model variants, inspired by traditional text-based search relevance feedback.

Method: Four feedback strategies: classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), generative relevance feedback (GRF) using synthetic captions, attentive feedback summarizer (AFS) with custom transformer model, and explicit feedback as upper-bound baseline.

Result: GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improved retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs and 1-3% for larger VLMs on Flickr30k and COCO datasets. AFS was robust against query drift in iterative retrieval.

Conclusion: Relevance feedback consistently enhances retrieval across VLMs and enables interactive and adaptive visual search without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

TL;DR: A novel method for generating synthetic LiDAR point clouds by editing real-world scans using semantic mask guidance and diffusion-based generation in 2D range view space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training autonomous driving systems rely on limited real-world point cloud data or expensive simulated environments, restricting system generalization and robustness, especially for edge cases.

Method: Transform LiDAR point clouds to 2D range images, use convex hull-based semantic masks to guide diffusion-based generation, ensuring geometric consistency and realism through semantic conditioning.

Result: High-quality LiDAR point cloud generation capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, validated on KITTI-360 dataset.

Conclusion: Provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data to improve autonomous driving system robustness.

Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: Current multilingual T2I models produce culturally neutral or English-biased outputs. The paper identifies insufficient activation of culture-related representations as the root cause and proposes two alignment strategies to improve cultural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual T2I models often fail to preserve cultural consistency across languages, producing culturally neutral or English-biased results despite having cultural knowledge.

Method: Proposed a probing method to localize culture-sensitive neurons, then introduced two strategies: inference-time cultural activation (amplifying identified neurons) and layer-targeted cultural enhancement (updating only culturally relevant layers).

Result: Experiments on CultureBench show consistent improvements in cultural consistency while maintaining fidelity and diversity compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address cultural bias in multilingual T2I models by targeting specific culture-sensitive neurons and layers, achieving better cross-lingual cultural consistency.

Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

TL;DR: MolSight is a three-stage learning framework for Optical Chemical Structure Recognition that addresses challenges in stereochemical information recognition through pre-training, multi-granularity fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCSR systems struggle with accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to subtle visual cues like wedge/dash bonds and spatial arrangements, which is crucial for chemical data mining, drug discovery, and LLM applications.

Method: Three-stage training: 1) Pre-training on large-scale noisy datasets for fundamental perception; 2) Multi-granularity fine-tuning with auxiliary tasks (bond classification, atom localization); 3) Reinforcement learning optimization using GRPO algorithm and novel stereochemical dataset.

Result: MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in stereochemical optical structure recognition, with the compact model further enhanced by GRPO algorithm for stereomolecular recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed three-stage framework effectively addresses stereochemical recognition challenges in OCSR, demonstrating superior performance even with relatively compact parameter sizes through strategic training and optimization approaches.

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.

*Xiongjun Guan,Zhiyu Pan,Jianjiang Feng,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiFingerPose is a bimodal finger pose estimation algorithm that combines capacitive images and fingerprint patches from touchscreens to accurately predict comprehensive finger pose information, including roll angle that was previously unachievable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing finger pose estimation methods on portable devices rely solely on capacitive images, which are limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and have reduced accuracy for large-angle inputs (>45 degrees). There's a need for more comprehensive and accurate finger pose estimation.

Method: Proposes BiFingerPose using bimodal input: capacitive image + fingerprint patch from under-screen fingerprint sensor. This combination enables reliable estimation of roll angle and improves prediction of other pose parameters.

Result: Outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5x higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy. Validated through 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks.

Conclusion: BiFingerPose demonstrates practical superiority for finger pose estimation and enables new applications in authentication security and interactive experiences. The approach shows the value of bimodal input for comprehensive finger pose estimation.

Abstract: Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority. Finally, we delineate the application space of finger pose with respect to enhancing authentication security and improving interactive experiences, and develop corresponding prototypes to showcase the interaction potential.

*Jiajie Guo,Qingpeng Zhu,Jin Zeng,Xiaolong Wu,Changyong He,Weida Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialGeo enhances MLLMs' spatial reasoning by combining geometry features from self-supervised learning with CLIP's semantic features through a hierarchical adapter, improving spatial reasoning accuracy by 8.0% with 50% less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MLLMs have limited spatial reasoning ability due to lossy visual embeddings from CLIP that focus on instance-level semantics, lacking spatial awareness needed for 3D spatial arrangements.

Method: Proposes SpatialGeo with hierarchical fusion of geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning and CLIP's semantic features via a hierarchical adapter, trained with random feature dropping to prevent trivial solutions.

Result: Improves spatial reasoning accuracy by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench while reducing memory cost by approximately 50% during inference compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SpatialGeo effectively addresses spatial ambiguity in MLLMs by integrating geometry features, significantly boosting spatial grounding capability with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

*David Nordström,Johan Edstedt,Fredrik Kahl,Georg Bökman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuM extends masked autoencoding to multiple views for 3D vision, outperforming DINOv3 and CroCo v2 on geometric tasks through uniform masking and inter-frame attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised learning methods focus on semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning, with CroCo being a notable exception for 3D understanding.

Method: Extends MAE to arbitrarily many views with uniform masking across all views and uses a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2 on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching, and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: MuM provides a simpler and more scalable approach than CroCo for learning 3D-aware visual representations through multi-view masked autoencoding.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.

*Dongbo Shi,Shen Cao,Bojian Wu,Jinhui Guo,Lubin Fan,Renjie Chen,Ligang Liu,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPe-NeRF++ is a local-to-global optimization method for training Neural Radiance Fields without pose priors, combining local joint optimization with global bundle adjustment to achieve superior pose estimation and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NoPe-NeRF struggle with accurate camera pose recovery in complex scenarios due to focusing only on local image relationships, creating a need for a more robust approach.

Method: The approach uses relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by local joint optimization, and then global optimization with bundle adjustment incorporating geometric consistency constraints and feature trajectories.

Result: The method significantly improves initial pose quality, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis, and demonstrates superior performance and robustness on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: NoPe-NeRF++ successfully combines local and global cues with NeRF, validating the design choices through extensive evaluations that show improved performance even in challenging scenes.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.

### [134] [Refracting Reality: Generating Images with Realistic Transparent Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17340)
*Yue Yin,Enze Tao,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to generate images with accurate refraction of transparent objects by synchronizing pixels using Snell's Law and recovering unseen surfaces via panorama generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative image models perform poorly at synthesizing transparent objects with accurate refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering effects due to insufficient understanding of optical laws.

Method: Synchronize pixels within and outside object boundaries using Snell's Law of Refraction at each generation step, and recover unseen surfaces by synchronizing with a second generated panorama image using the same warping and merging procedure.

Result: The approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect physical constraints compared to standard generative models.

Conclusion: By explicitly incorporating physical optics laws (Snell's Law) and synchronizing pixel information across different views, the method significantly improves the generation of refractive transparent objects in images.

Abstract: Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.

*Markus Pobitzer,Chang Liu,Chenyi Zhuang,Teng Long,Bin Ren,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for generating multi-media painting tutorials with semantics-driven style control, enabling consistent texture evolution and process transfer across different artistic media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing painting video tutorials lack interactivity and personalization, while current generative models struggle with cross-media generalization and temporal/structural inconsistencies in reproducing human creative workflows.

Method: Embed multiple media into diffusion models' conditional space with cross-medium style augmentation, using a reverse-painting training strategy for smooth, human-aligned generation. Built a large-scale dataset of real painting processes.

Result: Achieved strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics for cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity. Introduced Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve to quantitatively model human artistic progression.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generates coherent multi-media painting processes that faithfully reproduce human creative workflows with consistent texture evolution and style transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Step-by-step painting tutorials are vital for learning artistic techniques, but existing video resources (e.g., YouTube) lack interactivity and personalization. While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.

*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a label-efficient skeleton-based action recognition method using GCNs with a novel acquisition function that selects the most informative subsets for labeling based on data representativity, diversity, and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of costly and time-consuming manual labeling in skeleton-based action recognition by developing a more label-efficient approach.

Method: Uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with a novel acquisition function that optimizes data representativity, diversity, and uncertainty to select informative subsets for labeling. Also extends with invertible GCN for mapping data to latent spaces.

Result: Extensive experiments on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets show the method's effectiveness and outperformance against related work in label-frugal settings.

Conclusion: The proposed label-frugal GCNs provide an effective solution for skeleton-based action recognition with reduced labeling requirements, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition is a hotspot in image processing. A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured. Extensive experiments, conducted on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets, show the effectiveness and the outperformance of our label-frugal GCNs against the related work.

### [137] [DSeq-JEPA: Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17354)
*Xiangteng He,Shunsuke Sakai,Kun Yuan,Nicolas Padoy,Tatsuhito Hasegawa,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSeq-JEPA improves on I-JEPA by introducing discriminative sequential prediction, where regions are predicted in order of importance rather than uniformly, achieving better performance across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current I-JEPA treats all image regions uniformly and independently, lacking selective attention and sequential reasoning like human visual perception, which processes information from most to least important regions.

Method: Uses transformer-derived saliency maps to identify primary discriminative regions first, then predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, combining JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning.

Result: Outperforms I-JEPA variants across image classification, fine-grained categorization, detection, segmentation, and low-level reasoning tasks by focusing on more discriminative and generalizable representations.

Conclusion: Sequential prediction based on discriminative importance leads to better visual representations than uniform prediction, bridging predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning approaches.

Abstract: Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent embeddings of masked regions from visible context. However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

*Taixi Chen,Jingyun Chen,Nancy Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAM is a unified Attention-Mamba backbone for cell-level radiomics analysis that achieves state-of-the-art performance in both cell classification (78% accuracy) and tumor segmentation (80% precision) on H&E images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained tumor insights but are underexplored, with no dedicated backbone for radiomics data. Existing methods focus on slide/patch-level analysis and lack flexible architectures.

Method: Proposed Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone that flexibly combines Attention and Mamba modules in a single architecture without manual ratio tuning. Extended to multimodal framework for joint cell classification and image segmentation.

Result: UAM improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% (n=349,882 cells) and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% (n=406 patches), outperforming leading image-based foundation models on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: UAM demonstrates effectiveness as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis, highlighting the promise of unified architectures for fine-grained tumor analysis.

Abstract: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes and have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.

### [139] [SuperQuadricOcc: Multi-Layer Gaussian Approximation of Superquadrics for Real-Time Self-Supervised Occupancy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17361)
*Seamie Hayes,Reenu Mohandas,Tim Brophy,Alexandre Boulch,Ganesh Sistu,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperQuadricOcc introduces superquadric-based scene representation for semantic occupancy estimation, achieving 75% memory reduction, 124% faster inference, and 5.9% mIoU improvement over Gaussian methods while enabling real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian representations in occupancy estimation require large numbers of primitives, increasing memory usage and preventing real-time inference. Superquadrics offer reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements but lack rasterization capabilities for supervision.

Method: Uses superquadric-based scene representation with multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics to enable Gaussian rasterization for training supervision, and includes a fast superquadric voxelization module.

Result: Achieves 75% memory footprint reduction, 124% faster inference, 5.9% mIoU improvement on Occ3D dataset, 84% reduction in required primitives compared to Gaussian methods, and enables real-time inference without temporal labels.

Conclusion: SuperQuadricOcc is the first occupancy model to achieve real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance, demonstrating that superquadrics provide an efficient alternative to Gaussian representations for semantic occupancy estimation.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75\% reduction in memory footprint, 124\% faster inference, and a 5.9\% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84\% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be released as open source.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATAC is a simple test-time defense method that corrects adversarial perturbations in CLIP's embedding space using augmentation-induced drift vectors and angular consistency, achieving 50% higher robustness than previous methods with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but adversarial fine-tuning is too expensive. Existing test-time defenses have limited robustness, so a more effective and efficient solution is needed.

Method: ATAC operates in CLIP's embedding space, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer semantic recovery directions and correcting embeddings based on angular consistency of latent drifts.

Result: ATAC achieves 50% higher robustness than previous state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, maintains robustness in extreme settings, and shows nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: ATAC represents an efficient novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in CLIP's embedding space, demonstrating that simple augmentation-based correction can significantly enhance robustness.

Abstract: Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVRecon extends sparse voxel rasterization with SDF for high-fidelity surface reconstruction, addressing optimization challenges through geometric initialization and spatial smoothness losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse voxels are spatially disentangled with sharp boundaries, making them prone to local minima during optimization, while preserving SDF smoothness across independently parameterized voxels is challenging.

Method: Integrates SDF into sparse voxel rasterization, uses robust geometric initialization from visual geometry model, and applies spatial smoothness loss to enforce coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups.

Result: Achieves strong reconstruction accuracy across various benchmarks with consistently speedy convergence.

Conclusion: SVRecon successfully combines sparse voxels with SDF for high-quality surface reconstruction while maintaining fast convergence, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: We extend the recently proposed sparse voxel rasterization paradigm to the task of high-fidelity surface reconstruction by integrating Signed Distance Function (SDF), named SVRecon. Unlike 3D Gaussians, sparse voxels are spatially disentangled from their neighbors and have sharp boundaries, which makes them prone to local minima during optimization. Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show that our method achieves strong reconstruction accuracy while having consistently speedy convergence. The code will be made public.

*Zheng Wang,Yi Zhang,Siddartha Khastgir,Carsten Maple,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Non-Parametric Probabilistic Robustness (NPPR) as a practical alternative to existing probabilistic robustness metrics that require predefined perturbation distributions. NPPR learns optimized perturbation distributions directly from data for more conservative robustness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic robustness formulations assume fixed and known perturbation distributions, which is unrealistic in practice. There's a need for more practical robustness metrics that don't rely on predefined distributions.

Method: Develops NPPR using Gaussian Mixture Model with MLP heads and bicubic up-sampling to learn perturbation distributions directly from data, covering both input-dependent and input-independent scenarios.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across multiple architectures show NPPR provides up to 40% more conservative (lower) probabilistic robustness estimates compared to state-of-the-art methods using common predefined distributions.

Conclusion: NPPR is validated as a more practical robustness metric that addresses the limitation of requiring predefined perturbation distributions, offering more conservative evaluation under distributional uncertainty.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning frameworks for deformable image registration project high-dimensional deformation spaces into coarse representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. The challenge lies in the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space and scarcity of voxel-level supervision.

Integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning via Group Relative Policy Optimization using multi-trajectory sampling.

Result: Achieves consistent Dice improvements across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, Abdomen MR-CT) while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead.

Conclusion: MorphSeek advances representation-level policy learning for spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

Method: Integrated advanced generative models to create diverse high-quality synthetic face images representing varied facial traits that adhere to identity card photo standards, and introduced the DIF-V dataset as a benchmark.

Result: Analysis revealed existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and identity style modifications negatively impact model performance.

Conclusion: This work addresses dataset inequities, enriches diversity and ethics discussions in AI, and lays foundation for more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies.

Abstract: Face verification is a significant component of identity authentication in various applications including online banking and secure access to personal devices. The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies

### [145] [MCMoE: Completing Missing Modalities with Mixture of Experts for Incomplete Multimodal Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17397)
*Huangbiao Xu,Huanqi Wu,Xiao Ke,Junyi Wu,Rui Xu,Jinglin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MCMoE framework for multimodal AQA that handles missing modalities by dynamically reconstructing them and mixing expert knowledge, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal AQA models fail when modalities are missing during inference, causing catastrophic performance degradation due to interrupted cross-modal interactions.

Method: Uses adaptive gated modality generator to reconstruct missing modalities, modality experts for unimodal knowledge, and dynamic mixing of expert knowledge for joint representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on three public AQA benchmarks in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning scenarios.

Conclusion: MCMoE effectively addresses modality missing issues in multimodal AQA through unified unimodal and joint representation learning with mixture of experts.

Abstract: Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

*Sukwon Yun,Heming Yao,Burkhard Hoeckendorf,David Richmond,Aviv Regev,Russell Littman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-ViT is a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for Vision Transformers that addresses computational inefficiency in multi-channel image processing by selectively attending to relevant channels rather than all channel interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformers for multi-channel domains (like cell painting or satellite imagery) suffer from quadratic computational growth in attention due to modeling all channel interactions, leading to excessive FLOPs and high training costs.

Method: Treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention, inspired by Sparse Mixture-of-Experts philosophy.

Result: Proof-of-concept experiments on JUMP-CP and So2Sat datasets show substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing performance, and in some cases even enhancing performance.

Conclusion: MoE-ViT provides a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging by achieving better efficiency while maintaining or improving performance compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.

TL;DR: Proposes a knowledge distillation framework using a teacher network fine-tuned on task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in medical image analysis, achieving comparable performance to bias-free models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often learn shortcut solutions using spurious correlations, which can lead to poor robustness and patient harm by ignoring clinically meaningful features.

Method: Knowledge distillation framework leveraging a teacher network fine-tuned on small task-relevant data subset to guide student network trained on biased large dataset, targeting different shortcut types across network layers.

Result: Consistent improvements over traditional methods (ERM, augmentation-based, group-based bias-mitigation) across CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures, achieving comparable performance to bias-free models even on out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: The approach is practically applicable to real-world medical imaging where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify beforehand, effectively mitigating shortcut learning.

Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting appropriate remote sensing foundation models is difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints.

Method: Built RS-FMD database covering 150+ RSFMs across multiple modalities, then developed REMSA - an LLM-based agent that interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidates using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications.

Result: REMSA outperforms baselines including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs on a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios producing 900 configurations.

Conclusion: REMSA enables automated RSFM selection from natural language queries using publicly available metadata without accessing private or sensitive data.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models deployed in safety-critical applications need better adversarial robustness. Traditional single-teacher distillation suffers from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty balancing robustness and accuracy.

Method: Proposes MMT-ARD with dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture, dynamic weight allocation based on teacher confidence, and adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function to balance knowledge transfer across modalities.

Result: Improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on ViT-B-32 model, with 2.3x training efficiency increase over single-teacher methods.

Conclusion: MMT-ARD effectively enhances adversarial robustness of multimodal large models with improved scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making their adversarial robustness a crucial concern. While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization and enables high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation, and intuitive depth-aware editing.

Conclusion: By reframing depth as a creative abstraction rather than a physical quantity, illustrator's depth prediction provides a new foundation for editable image decomposition.

Abstract: We introduce Illustrator's Depth, a novel definition of depth that addresses a key challenge in digital content creation: decomposing flat images into editable, ordered layers. Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs. Our layer index inference unlocks a range of powerful downstream applications. In particular, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization while also enabling high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation from 2D images, and intuitive depth-aware editing. By reframing depth from a physical quantity to a creative abstraction, illustrator's depth prediction offers a new foundation for editable image decomposition.

TL;DR: This paper presents a study on using vision foundation models for unsupervised domain adaptation in lidar semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results by identifying key architectural choices and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation networks trained on one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars, creating a need for domain adaptation methods that can bridge this performance gap.

Method: The authors conduct an exhaustive study using unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, focusing on lidar backbone architecture, single pretraining for multiple domains, and keeping the pretrained backbone frozen while training only an MLP head for segmentation.

Result: The proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four challenging domain adaptation settings for lidar semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models can be effectively leveraged for lidar domain adaptation through careful architectural choices and training strategies, particularly by using frozen pretrained backbones with trainable MLP heads.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings. The code will be available at: https://github.com/valeoai/muddos.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network-based odometry method effectively leverages GPR B-scan image features for precise distance estimation and demonstrates superior performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: When performing robot/vehicle localization using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to handle adverse weather and environmental conditions, existing techniques often struggle to accurately estimate distances when processing B-scan images with minor distinctions. This study introduces a new neural network-based odometry method that leverages the similarity and difference features of GPR B-scan images for precise estimation of the Euclidean distances traveled between the B-scan images. The new custom neural network extracts multi-scale features from B-scan images taken at consecutive moments and then determines the Euclidean distance traveled by analyzing the similarities and differences between these features. To evaluate our method, an ablation study and comparison experiments have been conducted using the publicly available CMU-GPR dataset. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in all tests. Specifically, our method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE), and achieves an overall weighted RMSE of 0.449 m across all data sets, which is a 10.2\% reduction in RMSE when compared to the best state-of-the-art method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWMDT is a framework that transforms standard video diffusion models into counterfactual world models, enabling predictions of "what if" scenarios by creating digital twins of scenes, reasoning about interventions with LLMs, and generating modified visual sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models focus on factual predictions but lack the ability to answer counterfactual queries about hypothetical modifications to scenes, which is crucial for evaluating AI behavior under varying conditions.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Construct digital twins as structured text representations of objects and relationships, 2) Use LLMs to reason about intervention propagation through time, 3) Condition video diffusion models with modified representations to generate counterfactual visual sequences.

Result: CWMDT achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks, demonstrating that digital twin representations provide powerful control signals for video forward simulation.

Conclusion: Alternative representations like digital twins offer effective control mechanisms for counterfactual world modeling, enabling comprehensive evaluation of physical AI behavior through hypothetical scenario simulation.

Abstract: World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for radar modeling fail to represent arbitrary shapes and struggle with real-world radar signals collected over limited viewing angles, while optical 3D reconstruction methods don't work well when treating radar signals as camera views.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, (2) diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on radar signal frequencies in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Successfully reconstructs arbitrary 3D shapes from partially-observed radar signals, with robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data.

Conclusion: Radar2Shape enables effective 3D reconstruction from radar signals and the authors release two synthetic benchmark datasets to support future research in high-frequency radar domain.

Abstract: Determining the shape of 3D objects from high-frequency radar signals is analytically complex but critical for commercial and aerospace applications. Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.

TL;DR: A deep learning method to estimate spine age from MRI images, using the spine age gap (SAG) as a biomarker for spine health assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through MRI, and there's a need for automated methods to assess spine health.

Method: Computer-vision-based deep learning using 18,000+ MRI series, with eligibility criteria determined by UMAP and HDBSCAN clustering. Model selection via ablation study on data size, loss, and spine regions.

Result: The spine age gap (SAG) is associated with degenerative conditions (disc bulges, osteophytes, stenosis, fractures) and lifestyle factors (smoking, physically demanding work).

Conclusion: SAG may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health, correlating with both medical conditions and lifestyle factors.

Abstract: The human spine is a complex structure composed of 33 vertebrae. It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical demands require smaller, efficient multimodal systems, but downscaling LLMs disproportionately affects visual capabilities rather than inherited LLM abilities.

Method: Introduces Extract+Think approach: visual extraction tuning to train models to extract instruction-relevant visual details, followed by step-by-step reasoning using these extracted details.

Result: LLM downscaling causes sharp performance drops in both visual perception and reasoning. The proposed Extract+Think approach sets new standards for efficiency and performance in smaller multimodal models.

Conclusion: Visual extraction tuning combined with step-by-step reasoning effectively addresses the bottleneck caused by LLM downscaling, enabling efficient multimodal models without sacrificing visual capabilities.

Abstract: Scaling up multimodal models has enabled remarkable advances in visual understanding and reasoning, but practical demands call for smaller, efficient systems. In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers. Together, these components form our Extract+Think approach, setting a new standard for efficiency and performance in this space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence from small, transient textual cues in videos that require repeated inspection.

Method: A multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via supervised fine-tuning and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, using two datasets: Video-R4-CoT-17k for SFT and Video-R4-RL-30k for RL.

Result: Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and demonstrates generalization to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA.

Conclusion: Iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning, enabling models to pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions like humans do.

Abstract: Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvDiff is an event-based diffusion model that generates high-quality colorful videos from monochromatic event streams using a surrogate training framework and single forward diffusion step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional event-to-image reconstruction methods produce perceptually inferior results and struggle with scaling model capacity and training data due to the ill-posed nature of absolute brightness reconstruction from events.

Method: Proposes EvDiff with a surrogate training framework that eliminates need for paired event-image datasets, uses temporally consistent EvEncoder, and performs only a single forward diffusion step to reduce computational cost.

Result: Generates high-quality colorful videos from monochromatic event streams, achieving better performance on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: EvDiff strikes a balance between fidelity and realism, enabling scalable high-quality video generation from event streams without paired training data requirements.

Abstract: As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

TL;DR: A native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, addressing limitations of slow optimization-based methods and inconsistent 2D-lifting approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are too slow, while feed-forward methods using multi-view 2D editing suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality.

Method: Created a large-scale multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing covering addition, deletion, and modification tasks. Explored two conditioning strategies: cross-attention and a novel 3D token concatenation approach.

Result: Token concatenation proved more parameter-efficient and achieved superior performance. The method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed native 3D editing framework sets a new benchmark for efficient and high-quality instruction-guided 3D editing, directly manipulating 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass.

Abstract: Instruction-guided 3D editing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to broaden access to 3D content creation. However, existing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are prohibitively slow, while feed-forward approaches relying on multi-view 2D editing often suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional AR's multi-stage pipeline and enable higher fidelity experiences in realism, interactivity, and immersion.

Method: Replace conventional AR engine modules with unified generative backbone that jointly encodes environmental sensing, virtual content, and interaction signals as conditioning inputs.

Result: Establishes computational correspondence between AR and GAR, identifies technical foundations for real-time generative augmentation, and outlines prospective applications.

Conclusion: GAR represents a future AR paradigm that enables high-fidelity experiences while introducing new research challenges in technology, content ecosystems, and ethical implications.

Abstract: This paper introduces Generative Augmented Reality (GAR) as a next-generation paradigm that reframes augmentation as a process of world re-synthesis rather than world composition by a conventional AR engine. GAR replaces the conventional AR engine's multi-stage modules with a unified generative backbone, where environmental sensing, virtual content, and interaction signals are jointly encoded as conditioning inputs for continuous video generation. We formalize the computational correspondence between AR and GAR, survey the technical foundations that make real-time generative augmentation feasible, and outline prospective applications that leverage its unified inference model. We envision GAR as a future AR paradigm that delivers high-fidelity experiences in terms of realism, interactivity, and immersion, while eliciting new research challenges on technologies, content ecosystems, and the ethical and societal implications.

Abstract: Chest radiography remains one of the most widely used imaging modalities for thoracic diagnosis, yet increasing imaging volumes and radiologist workload continue to challenge timely interpretation. In this work, we investigate the use of MedImageInsight, a medical imaging foundational model, for automated binary classification of chest X-rays into Normal and Abnormal categories. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) fine-tuning MedImageInsight for end-to-end classification, and (2) employing the model as a feature extractor for a transfer learning pipeline using traditional machine learning classifiers. Experiments were conducted using a combination of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and real-world clinical data sourced from partner hospitals. The fine-tuned classifier achieved the highest performance, with an ROC-AUC of 0.888 and superior calibration compared to the transfer learning models, demonstrating performance comparable to established architectures such as CheXNet. These results highlight the effectiveness of foundational medical imaging models in reducing task-specific training requirements while maintaining diagnostic reliability. The system is designed for integration into web-based and hospital PACS workflows to support triage and reduce radiologist burden. Future work will extend the model to multi-label pathology classification to provide preliminary diagnostic interpretation in clinical environments.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: OmniLens++ is a framework for blind lens aberration correction that addresses data scalability and prior guidance challenges through expanded degradation diversity and Latent PSF Representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lens library pre-training pipelines face limitations in generalization due to difficulties in scaling data and lack of optical degradation prior guidance.

Method: Expands lens design specifications for degradation diversity, samples uniform distribution by quantifying spatial-variation patterns, and introduces Latent PSF Representation using VQVAE framework to learn degradation priors.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction on both real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib, with AODLibpro verified as scalable foundation and LPR enabling better utilization of large-scale LensLib.

Conclusion: OmniLens++ effectively overcomes generalization challenges in blind lens aberration correction through improved data scalability and degradation prior learning, showing strong performance across diverse optical degradations.

Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

### [164] [Learning Latent Transmission and Glare Maps for Lens Veiling Glare Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17353)

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VeilGen generates realistic veiling glare data and DeVeiler removes it using learned latent optical maps, improving image restoration for compact optical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Veiling glare from stray-light scattering degrades compact optical systems but is hard to model and remove with conventional methods due to its spatial-varying nature and lack of paired training data.

Method: VeilGen uses generative modeling with Stable Diffusion priors to simulate veiling glare and estimate optical transmission/glare maps. DeVeiler then uses these maps with a reversibility constraint for restoration.

Result: The approach achieves superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared to existing methods on challenging compact optical systems.

Conclusion: VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler, providing a practical solution for compound degradation in compact optics.

Abstract: Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler. All code and datasets will be publicly released at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DeVeiler.

*Nikesh Gyawali,Doina Caragea,Cornelia Caragea,Saif M. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Analysis of 18.7 million vaccine-related posts on X (Twitter) from 2013-2022 shows COVID-19 pandemic caused complex shifts in sentiment and discourse, with decreased negative emotions but increased surprise/trust words, and evolving patterns of vaccine hesitancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media and analyze the evolving narrative around vaccines, particularly comparing pre-COVID (2013-2019) and COVID-19 (2020-2022) periods.

Method: Created novel dataset of 18.7 million curated vaccine discourse posts from X (Twitter), filtered from 129 million initial posts. Applied social cognition theories and stereotype content model to analyze sentiment, emotion words, and discourse patterns.

Result: COVID-19 pandemic led to decreased negative emotion word usage but increased surprise and trust-related words. Vaccine language used more warmth-focused and competence-focused positive words early in pandemic, with marked rise in negative words towards pandemic's end, reflecting growing vaccine hesitancy.

Conclusion: The pandemic significantly shifted vaccine discourse on social media, with complex emotional and linguistic changes that evolved throughout the crisis, potentially indicating changing public perceptions and increasing vaccine skepticism over time.

Abstract: In this work, we study English-language vaccine discourse in social media posts, specifically posts on X (formerly Twitter), in seven years before the COVID-19 outbreak (2013 to 2019) and three years after the outbreak was first reported (2020 to 2022). Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a long-context Q-former and text-conditioning approach to improve human-robot interaction by enhancing robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for human-robot collaboration focus on clip-level processing and don't leverage long-context information from entire videos, even though actions in long-horizon tasks depend on each other throughout the video sequence.

Method: Proposes a long-context Q-former that incorporates left and right context dependency in full videos, and a text-conditioning approach that feeds text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate information abstraction by Q-former.

Result: Experiments with YouCook2 corpus show that accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in action planning performance, and the long-context Q-former improves both confirmation and action planning when integrated with VideoLLaMA3.

Conclusion: The proposed long-context Q-former with text-conditioning effectively enhances robot action confirmation and action planning in human-robot interaction by leveraging full video context and mitigating information abstraction issues.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.

Conclusion: MobileOcc dataset addresses the gap in semantic occupancy perception for mobile robots and demonstrates effective human occupancy modeling with broad applicability across different datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Dense 3D semantic occupancy perception is critical for mobile robots operating in pedestrian-rich environments, yet it remains underexplored compared to its application in autonomous driving. To address this gap, we present MobileOcc, a semantic occupancy dataset for mobile robots operating in crowded human environments. Our dataset is built using an annotation pipeline that incorporates static object occupancy annotations and a novel mesh optimization framework explicitly designed for human occupancy modeling. It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data. Using MobileOcc, we establish benchmarks for two tasks, i) Occupancy prediction and ii) Pedestrian velocity prediction, using different methods including monocular, stereo, and panoptic occupancy, with metrics and baseline implementations for reproducible comparison. Beyond occupancy prediction, we further assess our annotation method on 3D human pose estimation datasets. Results demonstrate that our method exhibits robust performance across different datasets.

Motivation: Traditional single-demand navigation doesn't reflect real-world complexity where people have multiple needs and personal preferences when moving through spaces.

Method: AWMSystem with BreakLLM (decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), StatusMLLM (monitoring), MASMap spatial memory, Dual-Tempo action generation, and Adaptive Error Corrector.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed TP-MDDN benchmark and AWMSystem effectively address multi-demand navigation with task preferences, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.

*Julien Merand,Boris Meden,Mathieu Grossard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Machine learning approach using CVAE to estimate multifingered gripper joint configurations from point cloud data, achieving real-time performance with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inverse kinematics methods require complex post-processing or numerical approximations for joint configuration determination, especially when dealing with intermediate phalanges in complex gripper fingers.

Method: Uses Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) that takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs corresponding joint configurations.

Result: Validated on MultiDex grasping dataset using Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively estimates joint configurations for grasp planning using AI-driven techniques, overcoming limitations of traditional IK approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: METIS is a vision-language-action model for dexterous manipulation that integrates multi-source human and robotic data through a unified action space and motion-aware dynamics representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck of scarce action-annotated data for dexterous manipulation by leveraging large-scale human demonstrations while overcoming limitations of prior works like limited scenarios and visual gaps between human and robot data.

Method: Construct EgoAtlas dataset integrating multi-source human and robotic data with consistent action space, extract motion-aware dynamics as compact motion representation, and build METIS VLA model that unifies reasoning and acting in one framework.

Result: Achieves highest average success rate in six real-world dexterous manipulation tasks, demonstrates superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: METIS represents a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation by effectively leveraging human priors and unifying reasoning with action.

Abstract: Building a generalist robot that can perceive, reason, and act across diverse tasks remains an open challenge, especially for dexterous manipulation. A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: IndustryNav is the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark that evaluates VLLMs' spatial reasoning in active, real-world warehouse environments with moving objects and humans, revealing significant deficiencies in path planning and safety behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied benchmarks focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. VLLMs continue to face substantial challenges in spatial reasoning.

Method: Created 12 high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios with dynamic objects and human movement. Used PointGoal navigation pipeline combining egocentric vision with global odometry to assess local-global planning. Introduced collision rate and warning rate metrics for safety evaluation.

Result: Comprehensive study of 9 state-of-the-art VLLMs shows closed-source models maintain consistent advantage, but all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance, and active exploration.

Conclusion: Embodied research needs to move beyond passive perception toward tasks requiring stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environments.

Abstract: While Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) show great promise as embodied agents, they continue to face substantial challenges in spatial reasoning. Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.

Result: The framework achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review while enabling deep interaction with human scientific community.

Conclusion: OmniScientist creates a sustainable innovation ecosystem where AI agents can comprehend human knowledge systems, collaborate effectively, and co-evolve with human researchers through comprehensive infrastructural support.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.

TL;DR: LLMs show universal cross-cultural alignment challenges including value instability, demographic under-representation, and non-linear scaling effects, with neither Chinese nor Western models achieving robust cross-cultural generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs influence high-stakes global decisions, ensuring their alignment with diverse cultural values has become a critical governance challenge.

Method: Multi-Layered Auditing Platform with four methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus, Diversity-Enhanced Framework, First-Token Probability Alignment, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for evaluating 20+ leading models.

Result: Mistral-series outperforms LLaMA3-series in cross-cultural alignment; Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning surpasses RLHF in preserving cultural variation; Chinese models emphasize multilingual optimization while Western models show persistent U.S.-centric biases.

Conclusion: Neither Chinese nor Western LLM paradigms achieve robust cross-cultural generalization, highlighting the need for improved cultural alignment methods in global AI governance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making across global contexts, ensuring their alignment with diverse cultural values has become a critical governance challenge. This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making. Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories. While China-origin models increasingly emphasize multilingual data integration for context-specific optimization, Western models demonstrate greater architectural experimentation but persistent U.S.-centric biases. Neither paradigm achieves robust cross-cultural generalization. We establish that Mistral-series architectures significantly outperform LLaMA3-series in cross-cultural alignment, and that Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning on diverse datasets surpasses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback in preserving cultural variation...

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: Pretreatment MRI features like non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer and improve machine learning model performance for predicting treatment response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify pretreatment MRI descriptors that can predict breast cancer's pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, potentially enabling better treatment selection and optimization.

Method: Retrospective single-center study of 129 breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (2016-2020). Used standardized BI-RADS and breast edema scoring on T2-weighted MRI. Performed univariable/multivariable logistic regression and trained random forest classifiers on 70% of data with validation on remaining cases.

Result: 46% achieved pCR (19% luminal, 55% triple negative, 59% HER2+). Non-spiculated margins and unifocality were independently associated with pCR. Adding MRI features to clinicobiological variables improved random forest classifier performance: sensitivity (0.67 vs 0.62), specificity (0.69 vs 0.67), precision (0.71 vs 0.67).

Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independent predictors of pCR and enhance model performance for predicting breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, supporting a multimodal approach for treatment optimization.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials \& Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes

### [175] [An Efficient Computational Framework for Discrete Fuzzy Numbers Based on Total Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17080)
*Arnau Mir,Alejandro Mus,Juan Vicente Riera*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper presents efficient algorithms for computing position functions of discrete fuzzy numbers over finite chains, achieving O(n²m log n) complexity and enabling scalable implementation of fuzzy logic operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient computational methods for discrete fuzzy numbers that can handle linguistic information in fuzzy systems, particularly focusing on reducing computational costs for position functions and their inverses.

Method: Introduces combinatorial algorithms that exploit the structure of total admissible orders to compute the pos function and its inverse exactly, with quadratic complexity in chain size and linear in membership levels.

Result: Achieved O(n²m log n) complexity where m is the dominant factor, enabling scalable operations. This substantially reduces computational costs for algebraic operations like aggregation and implication on discrete fuzzy numbers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient and scalable solution for computing position functions of discrete fuzzy numbers, facilitating practical implementation of fuzzy logic operations in systems handling linguistic information.

Abstract: Discrete fuzzy numbers, and in particular those defined over a finite chain $L_n = \{0, \ldots, n\}$, have been effectively employed to represent linguistic information within the framework of fuzzy systems. Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \in \mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address copyright infringement risks and high computational costs associated with neural-based music generation models that rely on large datasets.

Method: Proposes MusicAIR framework with novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core that connects lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features and create complete melodic scores from lyrics.

Result: System achieves 85% average key confidence (outperforming human composers at 79%), generates music adhering to music theory standards, and creates diverse human-like compositions.

Conclusion: MusicAIR serves as a reliable co-pilot tool for music composition and educational tutoring, lowering entry barriers for aspiring musicians while contributing innovatively to AI music generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have made music generation a prominent research focus. However, many neural-based models rely on large datasets, raising concerns about copyright infringement and high-performance costs. In contrast, we propose MusicAIR, an innovative multimodal AI music generation framework powered by a novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU), a plug-and-play method that decomposes forget gradient updates into tangential and normal components to retain space, executing only the normal component to achieve effective forgetting while preserving retained knowledge with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning faces a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation of retained knowledge. Existing methods lack formal analysis on how forgetting updates harm retained knowledge and whether side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees.

Method: First-order analysis of retain loss changes under parameter updates. Identifies that retain loss is unchanged to first order iff update direction is orthogonal to retain gradient subspace. GU decomposes forget gradient updates into tangential (harmful) and normal (safe) components, executing only the normal component within trust-region budget.

Result: GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, WMDP). The projected direction aligned with raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves.

Conclusion: Geometric disentanglement provides a theoretically sound and simple solution for machine unlearning that effectively removes forget samples' influence while preserving retained knowledge with formal guarantees, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients ("retain-invariant"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.

### [178] [Revisiting Multimodal KV Cache Compression: A Frequency-Domain-Guided Outlier-KV-Aware Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16786)
*Yaoxin Yang,Peng Ye,Xudong Tan,Chongjun Tu,Maosen Zhao,Jia Hao,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashCache is a frequency-domain-guided KV Cache compression framework for multimodal LLMs that identifies and retains Outlier KVs while reducing KV memory usage by 80% and speeding up decoding by 1.69x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs suffer from high inference overhead due to large KV Cache that grows with visual input length. Existing compression methods are incompatible with efficient attention kernels and ignore value vector contributions.

Method: Uses frequency-domain analysis to identify principal energy in KV matrices, develops Outlier KV Recognition Module to retain critical KV pairs, and implements Dynamic Budget Allocation for adaptive per-layer cache sizing.

Result: Achieves up to 1.69x faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance across multiple MLLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlashCache provides an effective KV Cache compression solution that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by leveraging frequency-domain analysis and outlier-aware retention strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes energy scaling laws for diffusion models that predict GPU energy consumption based on computational complexity (FLOPs), achieving high accuracy across different models and hardware architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing energy concerns of diffusion models by developing principled methods to predict energy consumption across various model configurations and hardware setups, as existing approaches lack systematic prediction capabilities.

Method: Adapt Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption using computational complexity (FLOPs), decomposing diffusion inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with comprehensive experiments across multiple diffusion models and GPU architectures.

Result: The energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy (R-squared > 0.9) within individual architectures and strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations.

Conclusion: The results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.

Abstract: The rapidly growing computational demands of diffusion models for image generation have raised significant concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.

TL;DR: CurvSSL is a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework that augments standard redundancy-reduction SSL with curvature-based regularization to explicitly shape local data manifold geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current non-contrastive SSL methods focus on statistical properties but largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold, which limits their effectiveness in capturing structural relationships.

Method: Uses standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss, augmented with curvature regularizer that computes discrete curvature scores from k-nearest neighbors on unit hypersphere (and kernel variant in RKHS), enforced via Barlow-style loss on curvature-derived matrix.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 show competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg.

Conclusion: Explicitly shaping local geometry through curvature regularization is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC successfully enables LLMs to perform structured, transparent multi-step reasoning through a BASIC-style prompting language, demonstrating reliable program simulation across different models.

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Motivation: Invalid benchmark questions undermine AI evaluation reliability, and manual error identification among thousands of questions is infeasible, creating a critical bottleneck.

Method: Leverages statistical analysis of response patterns based on the assumption that mean score summarizes model performance, flagging items when empirical statistics fall outside expected ranges. Includes LLM-judge first pass for initial review.

Result: Achieves up to 84% precision in identifying problematic questions across nine widely used benchmarks, significantly reducing human review effort.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision that combines statistical analysis with automated review to improve benchmark reliability.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

TL;DR: Proposes HTAM framework for domain-specific multi-agent systems that structures agents hierarchically based on task dependencies, demonstrated with EarthAgent for geospatial analysis and evaluated with GeoPlan-bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General agent frameworks like ReAct struggle in specialized domains requiring structured workflows and multi-step procedures, particularly in fields like remote sensing with specialized tools and complex processes.

Method: Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM) structures multi-agent systems into logical hierarchy mirroring domain's task-dependency graph, enforcing procedural correctness through sequential layers where sub-agents operate on preceding outputs.

Result: EarthAgent (HTAM instantiation) substantially outperforms established single- and multi-agent systems on GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step geospatial planning tasks.

Conclusion: Aligning agent architecture with domain's intrinsic task structure is critical for building robust specialized autonomous systems, moving beyond social role emulation to task-centric design.

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.
