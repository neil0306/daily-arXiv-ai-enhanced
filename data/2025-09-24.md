### [1] [Dynamic Prompt Fusion for Multi-Task and Cross-Domain Adaptation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18113)
*Xin Hu,Yue Kang,Guanzi Yao,Tianze Kang,Mengjie Wang,Heyao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt scheduling to address generalization limitations in large language models, replacing fixed prompt templates with adaptive prompt combination and alignment mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the generalization limitations of large language models in multi-task and cross-domain settings, where prior methods like SPoT rely on fixed prompt templates that lack flexibility.

Method: Proposes a dynamic prompt scheduling mechanism with a prompt pool and task-aware scheduling strategy, using task embeddings and gating mechanisms for prompt fusion, along with joint multi-task learning optimization and automatic scheduling weight learning.

Result: The method significantly improves performance on language understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks, demonstrating enhanced model stability and transferability across different task numbers and prompt temperature parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic prompt scheduling framework effectively enhances unified multi-task modeling and cross-domain adaptation, showing superior applicability and effectiveness compared to fixed prompt template approaches.

Abstract: This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in
large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior
methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study
introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt
scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling
strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different
tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across
tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating
mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between
prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible
sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective
centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning
strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference
and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of
sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact
of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm
the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and
enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt
scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language
understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate
its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and
cross-domain adaptation.

*Yue Zhang,Jiaxin Zhang,Qiuyu Ren,Tahsin Saffat,Xiaoxuan Liu,Zitong Yang,Banghua Zhu,Yi Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAUSS is a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across 12 core skill dimensions grouped into three domains: knowledge/understanding, problem solving/communication, and meta-skills/creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of LLMs' mathematical abilities by categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 12 skill dimensions across three domains, using categorized problems that isolate specific mathematical abilities to construct detailed skill profiles.

Result: The benchmark successfully created interpretable mathematical skill profiles for LLMs, demonstrated by profiling GPT-5-thinking and comparing it with o4-mini-high to reveal strengths, weaknesses, and differences.

Conclusion: GAUSS provides multidimensional, skill-based evaluation that faithfully represents LLMs' underlying mathematical intelligence, offering valuable insights beyond traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of
\textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a
benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill
dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem
solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing
problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate
specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and
interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles
faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify
how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of
\textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its
differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value
of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

### [3] [Event Causality Identification with Synthetic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18156)
*Haoyu Wang,Fengze Liu,Jiayao Zhang,Dan Roth,Kyle Richardson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel event causality identification method using the Rubin Causal Model and synthetic control techniques to generate counterfactual twins from text data, outperforming traditional approaches and GPT-4 on the COPES-hard benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECI methods relying on linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference risk false causality identification due to informal causality usage and specious graphical inference. The authors aim to distinguish causation from correlation more robustly.

Method: The approach treats the first event as treatment and the second as outcome, using the Rubin Causal Model. It generates synthetic twins through text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques when real matches are unavailable, allowing counterfactual analysis of causal effects.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance compared to previous approaches, including GPT-4, on the causality benchmark COPES-hard, showing more robust causal relation identification.

Conclusion: The synthetic control method combined with the Rubin Causal Model provides a more reliable framework for event causality identification by enabling counterfactual analysis through generated twins, overcoming limitations of traditional pattern-based approaches.

Abstract: Event causality identification (ECI), a process that extracts causal
relations between events from text, is crucial for distinguishing causation
from correlation. Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized
linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality
identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical
inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event
causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the
treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their
causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant
change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to
implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we
try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should
have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but
undergoes an intervention of treatment. However, the practical difficulty of
locating such a match limits its feasibility. Addressing this issue, we use the
synthetic control method to generate such a twin' from relevant historical
data, leveraging text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques. This
approach allows us to identify causal relations more robustly than previous
methods, including GPT-4, which is demonstrated on a causality benchmark,
COPES-hard.

### [4] [ZERA: Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent - From Zero Instructions to Structured Prompts via Principle-based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18158)
*Seungyoun Yi,Minsoo Khang,Sungrae Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZERA is a novel Automatic Prompt Optimization framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts using structured scoring with eight criteria and automatic weight inference, enabling fast convergence with minimal examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing APO methods focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles, making them costly and brittle.

Method: ZERA scores prompts using eight generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts based on these structured critiques for principled, low-overhead refinement.

Result: Experimental results across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets show consistent improvements over strong baselines in reasoning, summarization, and code generation tasks.

Conclusion: ZERA enables fast convergence to high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles, with ablation studies confirming the contribution of each component to effective prompt construction.

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM)
performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods
typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and
require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and
brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a
novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through
principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight
generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts
based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to
high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We
evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning,
summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt
construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available at
https://github.com/younatics/zera-agent.

### [5] [Thinking in a Crowd: How Auxiliary Information Shapes LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18163)
*Haodong Zhao,Chenyan Zhao,Yansi Li,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' reasoning is vulnerable to external information quality - helpful context improves accuracy but misleading information causes catastrophic performance drops, amplified by step-by-step thinking processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how external information (helpful, irrelevant, or misleading) affects LLMs' reasoning capabilities in complex, knowledge-intensive domains.

Method: Created SciAux dataset from ScienceQA to systematically test model robustness against different types of auxiliary information, analyzing the impact on step-by-step thinking processes.

Result: Thinking mode acts as a double-edged sword: helpful context improves accuracy but misleading information causes severe performance degradation that is amplified by the thinking process, reinforcing errors rather than conferring robustness.

Conclusion: The key challenge is not just making models 'think' but endowing them with critical evaluation skills to assess the quality of information used in their reasoning processes.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to
their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be
helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal
impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with
explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset
derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model
against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical
vulnerability: the model's deliberative "thinking mode" is a double-edged
sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a
catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process.
Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when
provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely
to make models "think", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate
the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/billhdzhao/SciAux.

### [6] [SIRAG: Towards Stable and Interpretable RAG with A Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18167)
*Junlin Wang,Zehao Wu,Shaowei Lu,Yanlan Li,Xinghao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework with process supervision to optimize retriever-generator coordination in RAG systems, achieving better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems suffer from suboptimal coordination between independently developed retriever and generator components, leading to irrelevant document retrieval and poor evidence utilization.

Method: Proposes a process-supervised multi-agent framework with two lightweight agents: Decision Maker (controls retrieval continuation) and Knowledge Selector (filters documents). Uses LLM-as-a-Judge for fine-grained supervision with process-level rewards, tree-structured rollout strategy, and PPO training.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks compared to standard RAG baselines.

Conclusion: The framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to existing retriever or generator components, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the
coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components
are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the
retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may
fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a
process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever
and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision
Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer
generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to
retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we
employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with
process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying
solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout
strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on
single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach
achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more
interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines.
Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no
modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world
RAG applications.

### [7] [ERFC: Happy Customers with Emotion Recognition and Forecasting in Conversation in Call Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18175)
*Aditi Debsharma,Bhushan Jagyasi,Surajit Sen,Priyanka Pandey,Devicharith Dovari,Yuvaraj V. C,Rosalin Parida,Gopali Contractor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ERFC architecture for emotion recognition and forecasting in conversations to help call center agents predict customer emotions and provide timely resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve customer experience in call centers by enabling agents to anticipate future customer emotions and provide appropriate responses, transforming unhappy customers into happy ones.

Method: ERFC architecture considers multi-modalities, different emotion attributes, context, and utterance interdependencies in conversations.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated through intensive experiments on IEMOCAP dataset.

Conclusion: ERFC approach provides significant business value for call center applications where customer happiness is paramount.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation has been seen to be widely applicable in
call center analytics, opinion mining, finance, retail, healthcare, and other
industries. In a call center scenario, the role of the call center agent is not
just confined to receiving calls but to also provide good customer experience
by pacifying the frustration or anger of the customers. This can be achieved by
maintaining neutral and positive emotion from the agent. As in any
conversation, the emotion of one speaker is usually dependent on the emotion of
other speaker. Hence the positive emotion of an agent, accompanied with the
right resolution will help in enhancing customer experience. This can change an
unhappy customer to a happy one. Imparting the right resolution at right time
becomes easier if the agent has the insight of the emotion of future
utterances. To predict the emotions of the future utterances we propose a novel
architecture, Emotion Recognition and Forecasting in Conversation. Our proposed
ERFC architecture considers multi modalities, different attributes of emotion,
context and the interdependencies of the utterances of the speakers in the
conversation. Our intensive experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset have shown the
feasibility of the proposed ERFC. This approach can provide a tremendous
business value for the applications like call center, where the happiness of
customer is utmost important.

### [8] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Detecting Antisemitism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18293)
*Jay Patel,Hrudayangam Mehta,Jeremy Blackburn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 8 open-source LLMs for detecting antisemitic content using in-context definitions as policy guidelines, introduces Guided-CoT prompting that improves performance across all models, and finds that Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hateful content detection requires continuous adaptation to social media's changing landscape, and automated tools need effective methods to handle policy guidelines for detecting specific types of hate speech like antisemitism.

Method: Evaluated 8 open-source LLMs using various prompting techniques, designed a new CoT-like prompt called Guided-CoT that handles in-context policy well, and introduced metrics to quantify semantic divergence in model-generated rationales.

Result: Guided-CoT increased performance across all models regardless of decoding configuration, model sizes, or reasoning capability. Llama 3.1 70B outperformed fine-tuned GPT-3.5. Analysis revealed notable differences and paradoxical behaviors among LLMs in utility, explainability, and reliability.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant differences in LLMs' capabilities for hate speech detection and demonstrates that effective prompting strategies like Guided-CoT can substantially improve performance without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Detecting hateful content is a challenging and important problem. Automated
tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous
training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work,
we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content,
specifically leveraging in-context definition as a policy guideline. We explore
various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT.
Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, increasing performance across
all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model sizes, or
reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5.
Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic
divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and
paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences
observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

### [9] [Exploiting Tree Structure for Credit Assignment in RL Training of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18314)
*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TEMPO is a critic-free RL algorithm that improves token-level credit assignment in LLM reasoning tasks by converting response groups into prefix trees and using branch-gated temporal-difference corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse delayed rewards in long reasoning sequences make token-level credit assignment challenging. Existing methods like PPO are complex to train and prone to overfitting, while GRPO ignores branching and spreads rewards uniformly.

Method: Prefix-to-Tree (P2T) converts response groups into prefix trees to compute nonparametric prefix values. TEMPO builds on P2T, using branch-gated temporal-difference corrections to provide precise token-level credit without learned value networks.

Result: TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on both in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution benchmarks (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) with Qwen3-1.7B/4B models.

Conclusion: TEMPO provides an effective critic-free alternative for RL-based LLM reasoning that handles branching better than existing methods while maintaining training efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over
long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study
the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple
responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align
with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the
outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it
is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is
not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can
make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable
rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores
branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that
converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes
\emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes.
Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated
\textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a
critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO
with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree.
At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO
reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit
without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B,
TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and
out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and
reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

### [10] [Brittleness and Promise: Knowledge Graph Based Reward Modeling for Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18316)
*Saksham Khatwani,He Cheng,Majid Afshar,Dmitriy Dligach,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs as reward models to judge reasoning paths in clinical knowledge graphs for diagnostic reasoning, finding that while path-judging performance improves with specific training, transferability to downstream tasks remains limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for diagnostic reasoning but lack reliable knowledge-grounded inference. Knowledge graphs offer structured biomedical knowledge, but current approaches integrate them via retrieval or fine-tuning rather than enabling structured reasoning. The authors aim to leverage LLMs as reward models to verify reasoning paths, inspired by computational theory that verifying solutions is easier than generating them.

Method: The authors treat LLMs as reward models to judge whether candidate reasoning paths in knowledge graphs lead to correct diagnoses. They systematically evaluate five task formulations for knowledge path judging and eight training paradigms. Experiments are conducted with three open-source instruct-tuned LLMs to test path-judging abilities and their generalization to downstream diagnostic tasks.

Result: Experiments reveal both promise and brittleness: specific reward optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, but transferability to downstream tasks (diagnosis summarization and medical QA) remains weak.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic assessment of 'reward model style' reasoning over clinical knowledge graphs, offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often
lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical
knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically
integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG
content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an
alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,
where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct
diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work
that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and
grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is
often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'
diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and
intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first
systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and
eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities
generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization
and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source
instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward
optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the
transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first
systematic assessment of "reward model style" reasoning over clinical KGs,
offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences
diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

### [11] [Speculate Deep and Accurate: Lossless and Training-Free Acceleration for Offloaded LLMs via Substitute Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18344)
*Pei-Shuo Wang,Jian-Jia Chen,Chun-Che Yang,Chi-Chih Chang,Ning-Chi Huang,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubSpec is a training-free method that accelerates parameter offloading for large language models by creating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded portions, achieving significant speedups while maintaining lossless quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face deployment challenges on memory-limited GPUs. Existing solutions like model compression degrade quality, while parameter offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference due to time-consuming data transfers during forward passes.

Method: SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. It shares remaining GPU-resident layers and KV-Cache to reduce memory overhead and enhance alignment, enabling speculative decoding without additional training.

Result: Achieves 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and average 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit) with high average acceptance length.

Conclusion: SubSpec provides a plug-and-play, lossless, training-free solution that significantly accelerates parameter offloading for LLMs while maintaining model quality, addressing key deployment challenges on memory-constrained hardware.

Abstract: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment
on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter
offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can
degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow
inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate
parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft
tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single
forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward
passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on
pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align
with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model
training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from
insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token
acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,
we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading
that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft
model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target
LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers
and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.
SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for
Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for
Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

### [12] [Speech Vecalign: an Embedding-based Method for Aligning Parallel Speech Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18360)
*Chutong Meng,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech Vecalign is a parallel speech document alignment method that uses speech segment embeddings without text transcriptions, producing longer and less noisy alignments than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more robust speech-to-speech alignment method that doesn't rely on text transcriptions and can handle large-scale unlabeled parallel speech data more effectively than existing mining approaches.

Method: Monotonically aligns speech segment embeddings without text dependencies, applied to 3,000 hours of unlabeled English-German speech documents from VoxPopuli to extract high-quality alignments.

Result: Produced about 1,000 hours of high-quality alignments, improving En-to-De and De-to-En speech translation performance by 0.37 and 0.18 ASR-BLEU respectively over Global Mining baseline, while matching SpeechMatrix performance with 8x fewer raw documents.

Conclusion: Speech Vecalign is an effective speech alignment method that outperforms existing mining variants and achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly less data, demonstrating robustness and efficiency for speech-to-speech translation tasks.

Abstract: We present Speech Vecalign, a parallel speech document alignment method that
monotonically aligns speech segment embeddings and does not depend on text
transcriptions. Compared to the baseline method Global Mining, a variant of
speech mining, Speech Vecalign produces longer speech-to-speech alignments. It
also demonstrates greater robustness than Local Mining, another speech mining
variant, as it produces less noise. We applied Speech Vecalign to 3,000 hours
of unlabeled parallel English-German (En-De) speech documents from VoxPopuli,
yielding about 1,000 hours of high-quality alignments. We then trained En-De
speech-to-speech translation models on the aligned data. Speech Vecalign
improves the En-to-De and De-to-En performance over Global Mining by 0.37 and
0.18 ASR-BLEU, respectively. Moreover, our models match or outperform
SpeechMatrix model performance, despite using 8 times fewer raw speech
documents.

### [13] [Interactive Real-Time Speaker Diarization Correction with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18377)
*Xinlu He,Yiwen Guan,Badrivishal Paurana,Zilin Dai,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-assisted speaker diarization correction system that enables real-time user feedback to fix speaker attribution errors, reducing DER by 9.92% and speaker confusion by 44.23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most speech processing systems operate in open-loop mode without user feedback, but human-in-the-loop workflows can enable higher accuracy in speaker diarization.

Method: Proposes a pipeline with streaming ASR and diarization, LLM-generated summaries, and verbal feedback integration. Introduces split-when-merged (SWM) technique to detect multi-speaker segments and online speaker enrollments based on user corrections.

Result: LLM-driven simulations on AMI test set show substantial improvements: 9.92% reduction in diarization error rate (DER) and 44.23% reduction in speaker confusion error.

Conclusion: The system effectively incorporates user feedback to improve speaker diarization accuracy, with analysis showing benefits across different settings including summary vs full transcript display and correction frequency.

Abstract: Most automatic speech processing systems operate in "open loop" mode without
user feedback about who said what; yet, human-in-the-loop workflows can
potentially enable higher accuracy. We propose an LLM-assisted speaker
diarization correction system that lets users fix speaker attribution errors in
real time. The pipeline performs streaming ASR and diarization, uses an LLM to
deliver concise summaries to the users, and accepts brief verbal feedback that
is immediately incorporated without disrupting interactions. Moreover, we
develop techniques to make the workflow more effective: First, a
split-when-merged (SWM) technique detects and splits multi-speaker segments
that the ASR erroneously attributes to just a single speaker. Second, online
speaker enrollments are collected based on users' diarization corrections, thus
helping to prevent speaker diarization errors from occurring in the future.
LLM-driven simulations on the AMI test set indicate that our system
substantially reduces DER by 9.92% and speaker confusion error by 44.23%. We
further analyze correction efficacy under different settings, including summary
vs full transcript display, the number of online enrollments limitation, and

### [14] [NormGenesis: Multicultural Dialogue Generation via Exemplar-Guided Social Norm Modeling and Violation Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18395)
*Minki Hong,Jangho Choi,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NormGenesis is a multicultural framework for generating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese, and Korean, featuring Violation-to-Resolution dialogue progression and exemplar-based refinement to improve pragmatic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication, enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but also socially acceptable across different cultures and languages.

Method: Proposes Violation-to-Resolution (V2R) dialogue type modeling norm violation progression, implements exemplar-based iterative refinement early in dialogue synthesis, and constructs a dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated for norm adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response.

Result: Human and LLM-based evaluations show NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing datasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization performance. Models trained on V2R-augmented data exhibit improved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and provides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically and culturally diverse languages.

Abstract: Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication,
enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but
also socially acceptable. We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for
generating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese,
and Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm
classification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution
(V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations
through recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic
consistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based
iterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design
introduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations
before full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a
dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm
adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based
evaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing
datasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization
performance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit
improved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts. Our work
establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and
provides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically
and culturally diverse languages.

*Armin Tourajmehr,Mohammad Reza Modarres,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' ability to generate culturally enriched Persian literary text using adapted creativity metrics and automated evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research has focused primarily on English literary generation, with limited exploration of non-English traditions and standardized creativity assessment methods for Persian literature.

Method: Built a dataset of Persian literary texts across 20 topics, adapted Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking for four dimensions (originality, fluency, flexibility, elaboration), used LLM as automated judge validated against human evaluations, and analyzed literary device usage (simile, metaphor, hyperbole, antithesis).

Result: Strong agreement between LLM and human judgments via intraclass correlation coefficients, revealing both strengths and limitations in Persian literary generation capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise but require further refinement for Persian literary text generation, highlighting the need for continued development in non-English literary AI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in
generating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior
research has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of
non-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing
creativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian
literary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset
of user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model
outputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and
elaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce
evaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate
its reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation
coefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models'
ability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor,
hyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need
for further refinement.

### [16] [Developing an AI framework to automatically detect shared decision-making in patient-doctor conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18439)
*Oscar J. Ponce-Ponte,David Toro-Tobon,Luis F. Figueroa,Michael Gionfriddo,Megan Branda,Victor M. Montori,Saturnino Luz,Juan P. Brito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study developed an automated method to measure shared decision-making (SDM) in patient-doctor conversations using language modeling and conversational alignment scores, showing associations with established SDM outcome measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shared decision-making is essential for patient-centered care, but no scalable automated methodology exists to measure SDM in clinical conversations at scale.

Method: Used 157 video-recorded patient-doctor conversations (42,559 sentences) to train deep learning and fine-tuned BERT models via next sentence prediction. Calculated conversational alignment scores and assessed associations with SDM outcomes using random-effects analysis.

Result: Fine-tuned BERTbase achieved highest performance (recall@1: 0.640). Conversational alignment scores from both DL and BERT models showed significant associations with OPTION12 and Decisional Conflict Scale scores, demonstrating automated SDM measurement feasibility.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduces an automated, scalable methodology to measure SDM using explainable conversational alignment scores, with potential for large-scale evaluation of SDM strategies.

Abstract: Shared decision-making (SDM) is necessary to achieve patient-centred care.
Currently no methodology exists to automatically measure SDM at scale. This
study aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language
modelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157
video-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre
trial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations
were transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs
and negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and
fine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each
top-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A
random-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial
arm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the
Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in
Decision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple
comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female,
mean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients
(1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1
of 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1
with 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012)
scores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12.
The Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated
with the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037). BERT model sizes did not have an
impact the association between CA scores and SDM. This study introduces an
automated, scalable methodology to measure SDM in patient-doctor conversations
through explainable CA scores, with potential to evaluate SDM strategies at
scale.

### [17] [CogniLoad: A Synthetic Natural Language Reasoning Benchmark With Tunable Length, Intrinsic Difficulty, and Distractor Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18458)
*Daniel Kaiser,Arnoldo Frigessi,Ali Ramezani-Kebrya,Benjamin Ricaud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogniLoad is a synthetic benchmark based on Cognitive Load Theory that systematically evaluates LLMs' long-context reasoning by controlling intrinsic difficulty, distractor interference, and task length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in LLMs fail to isolate critical factors like task complexity, distractor interference, and task length, making precise failure analysis difficult.

Method: CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with tunable parameters: intrinsic difficulty (d) for intrinsic load, distractor-to-signal ratio (ρ) for extraneous load, and task length (N) as proxy for germane load demands.

Result: Evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs revealed task length as the dominant constraint, varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity, and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios.

Conclusion: CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development through systematic control over cognitive load dimensions.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)
often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor
interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we
introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load
Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with
independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic
difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$)
regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy
for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs,
CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length
as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic
complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic,
factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a
reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM
reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

### [18] [LAWCAT: Efficient Distillation from Quadratic to Linear Attention with Convolution across Tokens for Long Context Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18467)
*Zeyu Liu,Souvik Kundu,Lianghao Jiang,Anni Li,Srikanth Ronanki,Sravan Bodapati,Gourav Datta,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAWCAT is a linear attention framework that efficiently converts pre-trained transformers into performant linear models, achieving strong long-context performance with minimal training data and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic computational complexity that limits their use in long-context applications, while training linear-complexity models from scratch is resource-intensive. LAWCAT aims to bridge this gap by efficiently transferring pre-trained transformer capabilities.

Method: LAWCAT integrates causal Conv1D layers for local dependency modeling and uses normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across context lengths. It distills knowledge from pre-trained transformers using short sequences (1K-length).

Result: Distilling Mistral-7B with 1K sequences achieves >90% passkey retrieval accuracy up to 22K tokens. Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant performs competitively on S-NIAH and BABILong benchmarks, requiring <0.1% pre-training tokens. LAWCAT shows faster prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences >8K tokens.

Conclusion: LAWCAT provides an efficient pathway to high-performance linear models suitable for edge deployment, significantly reducing the need for extensive long-sequence training data and computational resources.

Abstract: Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect
to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for
latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity
alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch
is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT
(Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization
framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained
transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates
causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs
normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying
context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling
Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval
accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context
window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance
on S-NIAH 1\&2\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark
(QA2\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\% pre-training
tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster
prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT
thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear
models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive
long-sequence training data and computational resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of LLM-graph interaction methods shows code generation performs best, especially on long-text/high-degree graphs, with all methods remaining effective on heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of principled understanding of LLM capabilities in graph machine learning tasks despite increasing use in domains like fraud detection and recommendation systems.

Method: Large-scale controlled evaluation across multiple axes: LLM-graph interaction modes (prompting, tool-use, code generation), dataset domains, structural regimes, feature characteristics, and model configurations with systematic feature/edge/label truncation.

Result: Code generation achieves strongest performance, especially on challenging graphs; all methods work on heterophilic graphs; code generation adapts reliance on different input types effectively.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive view of LLM-graph interaction strengths/limitations and key design principles for future approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph
machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like
fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest,
the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their
interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled
evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the
strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based
applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing
prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation,
web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting
homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both
short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM
sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by
methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to
quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable
guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance
on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs
where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction
strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption
that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is
able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to
leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a
comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph
interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to match specific rhythms using ByT5, with rule-based rhythm extraction and conditional denoising fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop tools for co-creative applications in composing classical Arabic poems by ensuring rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence.

Method: Rule-based grapheme-to-beat transformation for rhythm extraction, conditional denoising objective to fine-tune ByT5, curriculum learning with pre-training on general Arabic data then poetic data, and cross-lingual transfer from English to Arabic.

Result: Models achieve high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence in Arabic poetry generation.

Conclusion: The proposed model shows potential for co-creative applications in classical Arabic poem composition, successfully balancing rhythm and meaning.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to
conform to a specific rhythm using ByT5, a byte-level multilingual
transformer-based model. Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat
transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic
script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune
ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We
adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset
before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from
English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve
high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed
model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process
of composing classical Arabic poems.

### [21] [Trace Is In Sentences: Unbiased Lightweight ChatGPT-Generated Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18535)
*Mo Mu,Dianqiao Lei,Chang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for detecting AI-generated text that focuses on structural features rather than word-level patterns, making it robust against paraphrasing and modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI text detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing, suffer from biases from ChatGPT's word-level patterns and training data, degrade on modified text, and often require large models or online LLM interaction.

Method: Encodes sentence embeddings from pre-trained language models and models their relationships via attention. Uses contrastive learning to mitigate embedding biases and incorporates a causal graph with counterfactual methods to isolate structural features from topic-related biases.

Result: Experiments on two curated datasets (abstract comparisons and revised life FAQs) validate the effectiveness of the method in detecting both original and paraphrased AI-generated texts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of current detectors by focusing on invariant structural features rather than word-level patterns, providing robust detection of AI-generated text even when modified.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of ChatGPT has raised concerns about its misuse,
highlighting the need for robust detection of AI-generated text. Current
word-level detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing or simple prompts (PSP),
suffer from biases induced by ChatGPT's word-level patterns (CWP) and training
data content, degrade on modified text, and often require large models or
online LLM interaction. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel task to
detect both original and PSP-modified AI-generated texts, and propose a
lightweight framework that classifies texts based on their internal structure,
which remains invariant under word-level changes. Our approach encodes sentence
embeddings from pre-trained language models and models their relationships via
attention. We employ contrastive learning to mitigate embedding biases from
autoregressive generation and incorporate a causal graph with counterfactual
methods to isolate structural features from topic-related biases. Experiments
on two curated datasets, including abstract comparisons and revised life FAQs,
validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Jin Young Kim,Ji Won Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCQA is a novel reasoning method that uses cycle consistency to improve small language models' performance by generating questions from reasoning paths and selecting answers based on similarity to original questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time reasoning strategies work well for large language models but often fail to improve performance in smaller models, creating a need for effective reasoning methods tailored for SLMs.

Method: CCQA generates a question from each reasoning path and answer, evaluates them by similarity to the original question using a lightweight Flan-T5 model specialized for question generation, and selects the candidate with highest similarity score.

Result: CCQA consistently outperforms existing SOTA methods across eight models on mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed CCQA method effectively addresses the limitations of conventional reasoning approaches for small language models and demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the
accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller
models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches
often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose
\textbf{C}ycle-\textbf{C}onsistency in \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering
(CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs.
Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning
path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and
then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the
final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions
from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5
model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently.
From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on
mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method
establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source

*Yeongbin Seo,Gayoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A prior-based data filtering method using corpus-level term frequency statistics as a fast alternative to perplexity-based filtering for LLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perplexity-based filtering is time-consuming and unreliable with noisy/out-of-distribution data, requiring a more efficient and effective approach for data selection in LLM pretraining.

Method: Estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics, filters documents based on mean and standard deviation of token priors without requiring model inference.

Result: Achieves highest average performance across 20 downstream benchmarks while reducing time cost by over 1000x compared to PPL-based filtering.

Conclusion: The prior-based filter is simple yet powerful, applicable to symbolic languages like code and math, and dynamically adaptable to multilingual corpora without supervision.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive web corpora,
careful selection of data becomes essential to ensure effective and efficient
learning. While perplexity (PPL)-based filtering has shown strong performance,
it suffers from drawbacks: substantial time costs and inherent unreliability of
the model when handling noisy or out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we
propose a simple yet powerful alternative: a prior-based data filtering method
that estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics,
inspired by linguistic insights on word roles and lexical density. Our approach
filters documents based on the mean and standard deviation of token priors,
serving as a fast proxy to PPL while requiring no model inference. Despite its
simplicity, the prior-based filter achieves the highest average performance
across 20 downstream benchmarks, while reducing time cost by over 1000x
compared to PPL-based filtering. We further demonstrate its applicability to
symbolic languages such as code and math, and its dynamic adaptability to
multilingual corpora without supervision

TL;DR: TsqLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines data quality selection with sensitivity-aware low-rank adaptation to improve efficiency while maintaining performance on NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully fine-tuning large pre-trained models is computationally expensive, and existing parameter-efficient methods overlook layer sensitivity variations and training data importance.

Method: TsqLoRA integrates quality-aware sampling for selecting informative training data and dynamic rank allocation that adjusts each layer's rank based on sensitivity to parameter updates.

Result: Experimental results show TsqLoRA improves fine-tuning efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance across various NLP tasks.

Conclusion: TsqLoRA provides an effective solution for resource-efficient fine-tuning by addressing both data quality and layer sensitivity considerations.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models for downstream tasks has become a
fundamental approach in natural language processing. Fully fine-tuning all
model parameters is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially
in resource-constrained environments. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods reduce the number of trainable parameters but typically overlook the
varying sensitivity of different model layers and the importance of training
data. In this work, we propose TsqLoRA, a novel method that integrates
data-quality-driven selection with sensitivity-aware low-rank adaptation,
consisted of two main components: a quality-aware sampling mechanism for
selecting the most informative training data, and a dynamic rank allocation
module that adjusts the rank of each layer based on its sensitivity to
parameter updates. The experimental results demonstrate that TsqLoRA improves
fine-tuning efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance on a
variety of NLP tasks. Our code will be available at

TL;DR: UniECG is the first unified model that can both interpret ECG signals (ECG-to-Text) and generate ECG signals from text descriptions (Text-to-ECG), addressing limitations of current unified models like GPT-5 that fail to handle ECG data properly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified models such as GPT-5 perform well on general vision-language tasks but cannot correctly understand ECG signals for medical diagnosis or generate ECG signals, creating a significant gap in medical AI applications.

Method: A decoupled two-stage training approach: first learning evidence-based ECG interpretation skills (ECG-to-Text), then injecting ECG generation capabilities (Text-to-ECG) through latent space alignment.

Result: UniECG can autonomously choose to interpret or generate ECG based on user input, significantly extending the capability boundaries of current ECG models.

Conclusion: The proposed UniECG model successfully bridges the gap in ECG understanding and generation, providing a unified solution for ECG-related medical tasks with publicly available code and checkpoints.

Abstract: Recent unified models such as GPT-5 have achieved encouraging progress on
vision-language tasks. However, these unified models typically fail to
correctly understand ECG signals and provide accurate medical diagnoses, nor
can they correctly generate ECG signals. To address these limitations, we
propose UniECG, the first unified model for ECG capable of concurrently
performing evidence-based ECG interpretation and text-conditioned ECG
generation tasks. Through a decoupled two-stage training approach, the model
first learns evidence-based interpretation skills (ECG-to-Text), and then
injects ECG generation capabilities (Text-to-ECG) via latent space alignment.
UniECG can autonomously choose to interpret or generate an ECG based on user

TL;DR: Planorama study reveals that user preferences and model preferences don't accurately predict which LLM-generated plans actually help users succeed in tasks, exposing a misalignment between perceived helpfulness and actual helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether current LLM alignment methods (like RLHF and ChatbotArena) that rely on user preferences actually reflect what helps users succeed in complex tasks, since they assume preference equals helpfulness.

Method: Created Planorama interface where 126 users answered 300 multi-step questions using LLM plans, collected 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA success) versus user preferences, and simulated the setup with agents and reward models.

Result: 1) User/model preferences and agent success don't predict which plans actually help users; 2) The gap isn't due to user-specific preferences; 3) Surface-level cues like brevity and question similarity drive preferences but don't predict helpfulness.

Conclusion: Aligning helpful LLMs requires feedback from real user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful. The paper discusses actionable steps NLP researchers can take to address this problem.

Abstract: To assist users in complex tasks, LLMs generate plans: step-by-step
instructions towards a goal. While alignment methods aim to ensure LLM plans
are helpful, they train (RLHF) or evaluate (ChatbotArena) on what users prefer,
assuming this reflects what helps them. We test this with Planorama: an
interface where 126 users answer 300 multi-step questions with LLM plans. We
get 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA
success) and user preferences on plans, and recreate the setup in agents and
reward models to see if they simulate or prefer what helps users. We expose: 1)
user/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which plans
help users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) this
gap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successful
when using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity and
question similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail to
predict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback from
real user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so we
discuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem.

TL;DR: CAPE-KG is a consistency-aware framework for parameter-preserving knowledge editing that addresses inconsistency issues in multi-hop question answering by ensuring alignment between knowledge graph construction, updates, and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PPKE approaches based on knowledge graphs for multi-hop QA suffer from inconsistency problems including knowledge contamination, unstable updates, and retrieval behaviors that don't reflect intended edits, undermining reliability in multi-hop reasoning.

Method: CAPE-KG ensures KG construction, update, and retrieval are always aligned with MHQA task requirements, maintaining coherent reasoning over both unedited and edited knowledge through a consistency-aware framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on the MQuAKE benchmark show accuracy improvements in PPKE performance for multi-hop question answering.

Conclusion: CAPE-KG demonstrates the effectiveness of addressing consistency in parameter-preserving knowledge editing for multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-Preserving Knowledge Editing (PPKE) enables updating models with
new or corrected information without retraining or parameter adjustment. Recent
PPKE approaches based on knowledge graphs (KG) to extend knowledge editing (KE)
capabilities to multi-hop question answering (MHQA). However, these methods
often lack consistency, leading to knowledge contamination, unstable updates,
and retrieval behaviors that fail to reflect the intended edits. Such
inconsistencies undermine the reliability of PPKE in multi- hop reasoning. We
present CAPE-KG, Consistency-Aware Parameter-Preserving Editing with Knowledge
Graphs, a novel consistency-aware framework for PPKE on MHQA. CAPE-KG ensures
KG construction, update, and retrieval are always aligned with the requirements
of the MHQA task, maintaining coherent reasoning over both unedited and edited
knowledge. Extensive experiments on the MQuAKE benchmark show accuracy
improvements in PPKE performance for MHQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of
addressing consistency in PPKE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in LLM-as-a-judge evaluations by providing prediction intervals for LLM-based scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-as-a-judge has become popular for evaluating natural language generation, but its uncertainty remains underexplored, limiting reliability and deployment in applications.

Method: The framework uses conformal prediction to construct continuous prediction intervals from single evaluation runs, with ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. It also proposes a midpoint-based score as a low-bias alternative.

Result: Extensive experiments show conformal prediction provides valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees. Interval midpoint and judge reprompting are explored for better judgment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses uncertainty in LLM-as-a-judge evaluations through conformal prediction, offering reliable prediction intervals and improved scoring methods.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge has become a promising paradigm for using large language
models (LLMs) to evaluate natural language generation (NLG), but the
uncertainty of its evaluation remains underexplored. This lack of reliability
may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first
framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of
LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs
continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an
ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a
midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model
score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis,
which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with
coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and
judge reprompting for better judgment.

*Yizhe Huang,Yang Liu,Ruiyu Zhao,Xiaolong Zhong,Xingming Yue,Ling Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemOrb is a plug-and-play memory layer that uses strategy reflections to improve LLM agent reliability in customer service by enhancing success rates and consistency without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents in customer service often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and lack continual self-improvement mechanisms, making them unreliable in dynamic settings requiring stability and consistency.

Method: Proposes MemOrb - a lightweight verbal reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact strategy reflections stored in a shared memory bank for retrieval-guided decision-making without fine-tuning.

Result: MemOrb significantly improves success rate and stability, achieving up to 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials.

Conclusion: Structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents(LLM-based agents) are increasingly deployed
in customer service, yet they often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and
lack mechanisms for continual self-improvement. This makes them unreliable in
dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better
evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a
measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to
capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of
existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal
reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact
strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and
retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning.
Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and
stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success
rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our
results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for
enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service
scenarios.

### [30] [LOTUSDIS: A Thai far-field meeting corpus for robust conversational ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18722)
*Pattara Tipaksorn,Sumonmas Thatphithakkul,Vataya Chunwijitra,Kwanchiva Thangthai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOTUSDIS is a Thai meeting corpus with 114 hours of spontaneous dialogue featuring overlapping speech, recorded using multiple microtypes at varying distances (0.12m-10m) to study far-field ASR robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between pre-training data and real-world Thai far-field speech conditions, particularly the degradation of ASR performance with increasing distance and challenging acoustic environments.

Method: Collected 114 hours of spontaneous Thai dialogue with three participants per session, recorded simultaneously by nine single-channel devices (six microphone types) at distances from 0.12m to 10m. Provided standard train/dev/test splits and benchmarked Whisper models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions.

Result: Fine-tuning on LOTUSDIS dramatically improved ASR robustness: overall WER reduced from 64.3 to 38.3, far-field WER from 81.6 to 49.5, with largest gains on distant microphones. Zero-shot models showed strong degradation with distance.

Conclusion: Distance-diverse training data is crucial for robust far-field ASR. The publicly available corpus (CC-BY-SA 4.0) and baseline system enable reproducible research in Thai conversational speech recognition.

Abstract: We present LOTUSDIS, a publicly available Thai meeting corpus designed to
advance far-field conversational ASR. The dataset comprises 114 hours of
spontaneous, unscripted dialogue collected in 15-20 minute sessions with three
participants, where overlapping speech is frequent and natural. Speech was
recorded simultaneously by nine independent single-channel devices spanning six
microphone types at distances from 0.12 m to 10 m, preserving the authentic
effects of reverberation, noise, and device coloration without relying on
microphone arrays. We provide standard train, dev, test splits and release a
reproducible baseline system. We benchmarked several Whisper variants under
zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Off-the-shelf models showed strong
degradation with distance, confirming a mismatch between pre-training data and
Thai far-field speech. Fine-tuning on LOTUSDIS dramatically improved
robustness: a Thai Whisper baseline reduced overall WER from 64.3 to 38.3 and
far-field WER from 81.6 to 49.5, with especially large gains on the most
distant microphones. These results underscore the importance of
distance-diverse training data for robust ASR. The corpus is available under
CC-BY-SA 4.0. We also release training and evaluation scripts as a baseline
system to promote reproducible research in this field.

### [31] [Global-Recent Semantic Reasoning on Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18742)
*Yunan Wang,Jianxin Li,Ziwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyGRASP is a novel method that combines LLMs and temporal GNNs to handle Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs) by capturing both recent and global temporal semantics efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like GNNs and LLMs focus on static TAGs and fail to capture recent-global temporal semantics in DyTAGs, while also facing efficiency issues with abundant evolving text.

Method: DyGRASP uses node-centric implicit reasoning with sliding windows for recent semantics, explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and RNN-like chains for global semantics, and integrates both with dynamic graph structure through updating and merging layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show DyGRASP achieves up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval and demonstrates strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.

Conclusion: DyGRASP effectively addresses the challenges of DyTAGs by efficiently capturing temporal semantics and graph dynamics, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph
interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world
applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing
methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global
temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts
and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying
LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic
Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to
efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a
node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism
to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture
global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored
prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly,
we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as
the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers.
Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority,
achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task.
Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs
and LLMs.

### [32] [False Friends Are Not Foes: Investigating Vocabulary Overlap in Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18750)
*Julie Kallini,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher Potts,Martijn Bartelds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Token overlap in multilingual subword tokenizers facilitates cross-lingual transfer rather than causing interference, with performance improving as vocabulary overlap increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicting evidence about whether overlapping tokens across languages help or hinder cross-lingual transfer, by controlling for confounders like token frequency and segmentation granularity.

Method: Controlled experiments training bilingual autoregressive models on multiple language pairs with systematically varied vocabulary overlap settings, analyzing hidden representations and testing on XNLI and XQuAD benchmarks.

Result: Models with token overlap outperform disjoint vocabulary models, with transfer performance improving as overlap increases. Overlapping tokens create embedding spaces that capture cross-lingual semantic relationships.

Conclusion: Substantial shared vocabulary remains a beneficial design choice for multilingual tokenizers, as token overlap facilitates cross-lingual transfer rather than introducing interference.

Abstract: Subword tokenizers trained on multilingual corpora naturally produce
overlapping tokens across languages. Does token overlap facilitate
cross-lingual transfer or instead introduce interference between languages?
Prior work offers mixed evidence, partly due to varied setups and confounders,
such as token frequency or subword segmentation granularity. To address this
question, we devise a controlled experiment where we train bilingual
autoregressive models on multiple language pairs under systematically varied
vocabulary overlap settings. Crucially, we explore a new dimension to
understanding how overlap affects transfer: the semantic similarity of tokens
shared across languages. We first analyze our models' hidden representations
and find that overlap of any kind creates embedding spaces that capture
cross-lingual semantic relationships, while this effect is much weaker in
models with disjoint vocabularies. On XNLI and XQuAD, we find that models with
overlap outperform models with disjoint vocabularies, and that transfer
performance generally improves as overlap increases. Overall, our findings
highlight the advantages of token overlap in multilingual models and show that
substantial shared vocabulary remains a beneficial design choice for
multilingual tokenizers.

### [33] [When Long Helps Short: How Context Length in Supervised Fine-tuning Affects Behavior of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18762)
*Yingming Zheng,Hanqi Li,Kai Yu,Lu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Long-context SFT improves short-context performance in LLMs, contrary to expectations from pretraining patterns. The study reveals that both MHA and FFN components benefit independently, with long-context SFT promoting contextual knowledge while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data length affects LLM behavior on short-context tasks, as previous research focused mainly on pretraining effects but SFT implications remained unclear.

Method: Systematically investigated SFT data length effects by decoupling and analyzing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, studying their interaction, and testing hybrid training approaches.

Result: Found that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, with both MHA and FFN benefiting independently. Revealed a knowledge preference bias where long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge and short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge.

Conclusion: Hybrid training mitigates the knowledge bias, providing explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs by balancing contextual and parametric knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications
increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach.
While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively
studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we
systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on
short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves
short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from
long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this
phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both
independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction
and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual
knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making
exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that
hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for
fine-tuning LLMs.

*Wei-Ning Chiu,Yu-Hsiang Wang,Andy Hsiao,Yu-Shiang Huang,Chuan-Ju Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a systematic method using NLP to extract inter-firm risk relations from Form 10-K filings, outperforming traditional manual approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional risk assessment methods are subjective, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale, while interconnected risk events can trigger ripple effects across firms.

Method: Uses unsupervised fine-tuning based on chronological and lexical patterns in Form 10-K filings to capture implicit risk connections, developing a domain-specific financial encoder with quantitative risk relation scores.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms strong baselines across multiple evaluation settings.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, transparent, and interpretable alternative to manual risk relation analysis for applications like portfolio management.

Abstract: A multitude of interconnected risk events -- ranging from regulatory changes
to geopolitical tensions -- can trigger ripple effects across firms.
Identifying inter-firm risk relations is thus crucial for applications like
portfolio management and investment strategy. Traditionally, such assessments
rely on expert judgment and manual analysis, which are, however, subjective,
labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. To address this, we propose a
systematic method for extracting inter-firm risk relations using Form 10-K
filings -- authoritative, standardized financial documents -- as our data
source. Leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, our approach
captures implicit and abstract risk connections through unsupervised
fine-tuning based on chronological and lexical patterns in the filings. This
enables the development of a domain-specific financial encoder with a deeper
contextual understanding and introduces a quantitative risk relation score for
transparency, interpretable analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines across multiple evaluation settings.

*Chen Liang,Zhaoqi Huang,Haofen Wang,Fu Chai,Chunying Yu,Huanhuan Wei,Zhengjie Liu,Yanpeng Li,Hongjun Wang,Ruifeng Luo,Xianzhong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction domain, revealing performance declines across cognitive levels despite proficiency in basic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robustness and reliability evaluation for LLMs in the safety-critical AEC domain, where specialized knowledge and complex reasoning are required.

Method: Created AECBench with 23 tasks across 5 cognitive levels (Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, Application), developed a 4,800-question dataset from authentic AEC practice, and used LLM-as-a-Judge approach for scalable evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 9 LLMs showed clear performance decline across cognitive levels - proficient in basic tasks but significant deficits in table interpretation, complex reasoning/calculation, and domain-specific document generation.

Conclusion: The study provides groundwork for future development of robust LLM integration into safety-critical engineering practices, highlighting current limitations in specialized AEC applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing
increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the
building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a
specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this
challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed
to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain.
The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level
cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization,
Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were
derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to
specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset
encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted
primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review.
Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable
and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses
leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear
performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite
demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization
and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits,
particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing
complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents.
Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and
development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into
safety-critical engineering practices.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model diffing analysis reveals that SimPO fine-tuning enhances Gemma-2-9b-it's safety, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities while reducing self-reference and hallucination management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarking fails to explain why one LLM outperforms another, so this work uses mechanistic interpretability to understand specific capability differences between fine-tuned models.

Method: Uses model diffing with crosscoders to identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate Gemma-2-9b-it and its SimPO-enhanced variant.

Result: SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and instruction-following (+151.7%), while reducing emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management (-68.5%).

Conclusion: Model diffing provides fine-grained insights beyond leaderboard metrics, offering a transparent framework for comparing LLMs by attributing performance gaps to concrete mechanistic capabilities.

Abstract: As fine-tuning becomes the dominant paradigm for improving large language
models (LLMs), understanding what changes during this process is increasingly
important. Traditional benchmarking often fails to explain why one model
outperforms another. In this work, we use model diffing, a mechanistic
interpretability approach, to analyze the specific capability differences
between Gemma-2-9b-it and a SimPO-enhanced variant. Using crosscoders, we
identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate the two
models. We find that SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance
safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and
instruction-following (+151.7%), while its additional training also reduces
emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management
(-68.5%). Our analysis shows that model diffing can yield fine-grained insights
beyond leaderboard metrics, attributing performance gaps to concrete
mechanistic capabilities. This approach offers a transparent and targeted
framework for comparing LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPEX is a novel multi-agent framework for keyphrase extraction that uses LLM-based agents with dynamic adaptation to document length, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised prompt-based methods use uniform prompting regardless of document length or LLM backbone, limiting exploitation of LLMs' capabilities for keyphrase extraction across diverse scenarios.

Method: MAPEX coordinates LLM-based agents through expert recruitment, candidate extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing modules. It uses a dual-path strategy: knowledge-driven extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three LLMs show MAPEX outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44% and standard LLM baselines by 4.01% in F1@5 on average.

Conclusion: MAPEX demonstrates strong generalization and universality, proving multi-agent collaboration effectively enhances keyphrase extraction performance across diverse scenarios and LLM backbones.

Abstract: Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing.
However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting,
regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs
hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities,
especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework
that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX
coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate
extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A
dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven
extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts.
Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs
demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the
state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44\% and standard LLM baselines by
4.01\% in F1@5 on average. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-weight LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 perform comparably to proprietary models in biomedical QA, with ensemble strategies sometimes outperforming closed-source counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if small open-weight LLMs can effectively replace larger closed-source models in biomedical question-answering, particularly in the BioASQ challenge context.

Method: Used various techniques including embedding-based snippet retrieval, in-context learning, structured outputs, and ensemble approaches combining multiple open-weight models for exact-answer questions.

Result: Open-weight LLMs demonstrated comparable performance to proprietary models like GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet, with some instances showing superior performance when using ensemble strategies.

Conclusion: Open-weight LLMs are viable alternatives to proprietary models in biomedical QA, with ensemble approaches enhancing their capabilities to potentially surpass closed-source counterparts.

Abstract: Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing,
with state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-V3 now performing comparably to
proprietary LLMs. This progression raises the question of whether small
open-weight LLMs are capable of effectively replacing larger closed-source
models. We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical
question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B
of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models
against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various
techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding
distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions,
we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by
different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that
open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances,
open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when
ensembling strategies were applied. All code is publicly available at

*Luyan Zhang,Xinyu Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-feature integration for AI text detection provides minimal performance gains (0.4-0.5%) with substantial computational overhead (4.2x), suggesting modern neural models already capture most relevant detection signals efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features can significantly improve AI text detection beyond single neural models, as this assumption hasn't been rigorously tested with modern LLM-generated text.

Method: Implemented MHFD (Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection) integrating DeBERTa-based semantic analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through adaptive fusion.

Result: MHFD achieves 89.7% accuracy in in-domain detection and 84.2% in cross-domain detection, showing only modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods despite the computational overhead.

Conclusion: Multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits with substantial computational costs, indicating that modern neural language models may already capture most relevant detection signals efficiently.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is
growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve
AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition
suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should
provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested
with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical
investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection,
specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple
feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD
(Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic
analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through
adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite
theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits
(0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x
overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture
most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in
in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain
detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.

TL;DR: DivEye is a novel AI-generated text detection framework that uses surprisal-based features to capture unpredictability fluctuations in text, outperforming existing detectors and providing interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat LLM misuse in education, business, journalism, and social media by developing a more effective and interpretable detector that can handle high-quality AI-generated content where traditional methods fail.

Method: Uses surprisal-based features to capture how unpredictability fluctuates across text, leveraging the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs.

Result: Outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2%, achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines, robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as auxiliary signal.

Conclusion: Rhythmic unpredictability is a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection, and DivEye provides both effective detection and interpretable insights into why texts are flagged as AI-generated.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of
LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where
synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors
often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these
approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little
interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework
that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using
surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text
exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM
outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical
features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2%
and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple
benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks,
generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of
existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond
detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged,
pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal
for LLM detection.

TL;DR: JEDI is an encoder-only architecture that jointly performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference without requiring generative models, achieving competitive accuracy and improved robustness in NLI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for atomic fact decomposition in NLI rely on resource-intensive generative LLMs, which are inefficient for inference. There's a need for more efficient approaches that maintain interpretability and robustness.

Method: Proposed JEDI architecture uses encoder-only design for joint extractive atomic fact decomposition and inference. Trained on a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI benchmarks.

Result: JEDI achieves competitive in-distribution accuracy and significantly improves robustness out-of-distribution and in adversarial settings compared to models using only extractive rationale supervision.

Conclusion: Interpretability and robust generalization in NLI can be effectively achieved using encoder-only architectures and synthetic rationales, eliminating the need for generative models during inference.

Abstract: Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as
automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance
interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on
resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform
decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly
performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference
without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training,
we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI
benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive
accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of
distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive
rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust
generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and
synthetic rationales. Code and data available at https://jedi.nicpopovic.com

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to align speech and text embeddings for End-to-End Speech Translation, addressing modality gap issues more effectively than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for bridging the modality gap in E2E-ST require alignment tools not available for all languages, and nearest-neighbor similarity search approaches don't produce accurate alignments.

Method: The authors adapt Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for aligning speech and text embeddings during training to bridge the representation discrepancy between speech and text modalities.

Result: The method produces more accurate alignments, achieves comparable E2E-ST results while being significantly faster, and outperforms previous work in low resource settings on 5 out of 6 language directions.

Conclusion: DTW-based alignment is an effective approach for bridging the modality gap in E2E-ST, offering improved accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) is the task of translating source
speech directly into target text bypassing the intermediate transcription step.
The representation discrepancy between the speech and text modalities has
motivated research on what is known as bridging the modality gap.
State-of-the-art methods addressed this by aligning speech and text
representations on the word or token level. Unfortunately, this requires an
alignment tool that is not available for all languages. Although this issue has
been addressed by aligning speech and text embeddings using nearest-neighbor
similarity search, it does not lead to accurate alignments. In this work, we
adapt Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for aligning speech and text embeddings during
training. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
bridging the modality gap in E2E-ST. Compared to previous work, our method
produces more accurate alignments and achieves comparable E2E-ST results while
being significantly faster. Furthermore, our method outperforms previous work
in low resource settings on 5 out of 6 language directions.

### [43] [Investigating Test-Time Scaling with Reranking for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19020)
*Shaomu Tan,Ryosuke Mitani,Ritvik Choudhary,Toshiyuki Sekiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) for machine translation: generating multiple candidates and selecting the best at inference time can improve translation quality, especially for high-resource languages, but has limitations in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling model parameters is computationally expensive. TTS offers an alternative by allocating more computation at inference time, but it hasn't been systematically explored for machine translation despite effectiveness in other tasks like mathematical reasoning.

Method: Systematic study of TTS for MT using a best-of-N framework on WMT24 benchmarks, covering six high-resource and one low-resource language pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budgets (N up to 1024).

Result: For high-resource languages, TTS improves translation quality across multiple neural MT evaluation metrics; smaller models with large N can match/surpass larger models at N=1; under fixed compute budgets, larger models are more efficient; TTS can degrade quality in low-resource cases due to metric blind spots.

Conclusion: TTS is effective for machine translation in high-resource scenarios but has limitations in low-resource settings, suggesting careful consideration of compute budgets and model sizes when implementing test-time scaling strategies.

Abstract: Scaling model parameters has become the de facto strategy for improving NLP
systems, but it comes with substantial computational costs. Test-Time Scaling
(TTS) offers an alternative by allocating more computation at inference:
generating multiple candidates and selecting the best. While effective in tasks
such as mathematical reasoning, TTS has not been systematically explored for
machine translation (MT). In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of TTS for MT, investigating a simple but practical best-of-N framework on
WMT24 benchmarks. Our experiments cover six high-resource and one low-resource
language pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budget (N up
to 1024). Our results show that a) For high-resource languages, TTS generally
improves translation quality according to multiple neural MT evaluation
metrics, and our human evaluation confirms these gains; b) Augmenting smaller
models with large $N$ can match or surpass larger models at $N{=}1$ with more
compute cost; c) Under fixed compute budgets, larger models are typically more
efficient, and TTS can degrade quality due to metric blind spots in
low-resource cases.

Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed
research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language
Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the
Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to
CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the

2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its
metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well
as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal
is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable
insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting
informed decisions and future directions in the field.

### [45] [Pathways of Thoughts: Multi-Directional Thinking for Long-form Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19094)
*Alireza Salemi,Cheng Li,Mingyang Zhang,Qiaozhu Mei,Zhuowan Li,Spurthi Amba Hombaiah,Weize Kong,Tao Chen,Hamed Zamani,Michael Bendersky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pathways of Thoughts (PoT) is an inference-stage method that enables personalized question answering by modeling LLM reasoning as an iterative decision process with multiple cognitive operations, achieving significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized QA systems are needed to adapt to user-specific information needs, but face challenges in inferring preferences from noisy contexts and generating responses that are correct, contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations.

Method: PoT models LLM reasoning as an iterative decision process where the model dynamically selects among cognitive operations (reasoning, revision, personalization, clarification) to explore multiple reasoning trajectories and produce diverse candidate responses, then aggregates them based on inferred user preferences.

Result: Experiments on LaMP-QA benchmark show PoT consistently outperforms competitive baselines with up to 13.1% relative improvement. Human evaluation shows annotators prefer PoT outputs in 66% of cases with only 15% ties.

Conclusion: PoT provides an effective inference-stage method for personalized QA that works with any LLM without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating significant improvements in both automated metrics and human evaluation.

Abstract: Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to
user-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user
satisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to
challenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit
contexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct,
contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background
knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT),
an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM)
without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning
of an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects
among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and
clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories,
producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT
then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user
preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the
complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA
benchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms
competitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human
evaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from
PoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.

### [46] [Are most sentences unique? An empirical examination of Chomskyan claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19108)
*Hiram Ring*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper empirically investigates the linguistic claim that most sentences are unique, finding that while unique sentences are often the majority in corpora, this varies significantly by genre and duplicate sentences are not insignificant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the common linguistic assertion (e.g., by Pinker and Chomsky) that virtually every sentence uttered is unique, using large corpora for empirical validation.

Method: Used the NLTK Python library to parse corpora of different genres and count exact string matches of sentences within each corpus.

Result: Found that completely unique sentences are often the majority in corpora, but this is highly constrained by genre, and duplicate sentences constitute a non-trivial portion of any individual corpus.

Conclusion: The claim that most sentences are unique holds true overall but is genre-dependent, and duplicate sentences play a more significant role than previously acknowledged in linguistic theory.

Abstract: A repeated claim in linguistics is that the majority of linguistic utterances
are unique. For example, Pinker (1994: 10), summarizing an argument by Noam
Chomsky, states that "virtually every sentence that a person utters or
understands is a brand-new combination of words, appearing for the first time
in the history of the universe." With the increased availability of large
corpora, this is a claim that can be empirically investigated. The current
paper addresses the question by using the NLTK Python library to parse corpora
of different genres, providing counts of exact string matches in each. Results
show that while completely unique sentences are often the majority of corpora,
this is highly constrained by genre, and that duplicate sentences are not an
insignificant part of any individual corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KyrgyzNER is the first manually annotated NER dataset for Kyrgyz language, containing 1,499 news articles with 39,075 entity mentions across 27 classes. The paper evaluates various NER models and finds multilingual RoBERTa performs best, highlighting challenges and opportunities for low-resource language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of named entity recognition resources for the Kyrgyz language by creating the first manually annotated dataset and evaluating state-of-the-art models on this low-resource language.

Method: Created KyrgyzNER dataset from 1,499 news articles (10,900 sentences, 39,075 entity mentions across 27 classes). Evaluated traditional sequence labeling (CRF) and multilingual transformer models (including RoBERTa) fine-tuned on the dataset.

Result: All models struggled with rare entity categories. Multilingual RoBERTa achieved the best balance between precision and recall, though other multilingual models yielded comparable results.

Conclusion: Multilingual pretrained models show promise for low-resource languages like Kyrgyz, but more granular annotation schemes could provide deeper insights for Kyrgyz language processing pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce KyrgyzNER, the first manually annotated named entity recognition
dataset for the Kyrgyz language. Comprising 1,499 news articles from the 24.KG
news portal, the dataset contains 10,900 sentences and 39,075 entity mentions
across 27 named entity classes. We show our annotation scheme, discuss the
challenges encountered in the annotation process, and present the descriptive
statistics. We also evaluate several named entity recognition models, including
traditional sequence labeling approaches based on conditional random fields and
state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models fine-tuned on our
dataset. While all models show difficulties with rare entity categories, models
such as the multilingual RoBERTa variant pretrained on a large corpus across
many languages achieve a promising balance between precision and recall. These
findings emphasize both the challenges and opportunities of using multilingual
pretrained models for processing languages with limited resources. Although the
multilingual RoBERTa model performed best, other multilingual models yielded
comparable results. This suggests that future work exploring more granular
annotation schemes may offer deeper insights for Kyrgyz language processing
pipelines evaluation.

TL;DR: A novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that uses LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering to organize scientific literature more effectively than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing taxonomy construction methods using unsupervised clustering or direct LLM prompting lack coherence and granularity, creating a need for more effective organization of rapidly growing scientific literature.

Method: Proposes a framework that leverages LLMs to identify key aspects of papers (methodology, dataset, evaluation), generates aspect-specific summaries, then encodes and clusters them along each aspect to form coherent hierarchies.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability. Also introduces a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted taxonomies covering 11.6k papers.

Conclusion: The proposed context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework provides superior organization of scientific literature compared to existing methods, with demonstrated improvements in coherence and granularity.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to
organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction
methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large
language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a
novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates
LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages
LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset,
evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then
encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In
addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted
taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated
dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'anecdoctoring' - a novel red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across languages and cultures to test generative AI's vulnerability to disinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disinformation is a top risk of generative AI misuse, and current red-teaming evaluations are US- and English-centric, lacking robustness across diverse languages and cultures.

Method: Collect misinformation claims from fact-checking websites in English, Spanish, and Hindi across US and India. Cluster claims into narratives, characterize clusters with knowledge graphs, and augment an attacker LLM to generate adversarial prompts.

Result: The method produces higher attack success rates and offers interpretability benefits compared to few-shot prompting, demonstrating the need for globally scalable disinformation mitigations.

Conclusion: Results underscore the necessity for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are grounded in real-world adversarial misuse scenarios.

Abstract: Disinformation is among the top risks of generative artificial intelligence
(AI) misuse. Global adoption of generative AI necessitates red-teaming
evaluations (i.e., systematic adversarial probing) that are robust across
diverse languages and cultures, but red-teaming datasets are commonly US- and
English-centric. To address this gap, we propose "anecdoctoring", a novel
red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across
languages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking
websites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies
(US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and
characterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we
augment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and
offers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting. Results
underscore the need for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are
grounded in real-world adversarial misuse.

*Chantal Shaib,Tuhin Chakrabarty,Diego Garcia-Olano,Byron C. Wallace*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a taxonomy and measurement framework for AI 'slop' - low-quality AI-generated text - through expert interviews and proposes interpretable dimensions for assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently no agreed-upon definition of AI 'slop' nor means to measure its occurrence, despite it being an increasingly popular term for low-quality AI-generated text.

Method: Developed a taxonomy through interviews with NLP, writing, and philosophy experts; conducted span-level annotation to assess binary 'slop' judgments and correlate them with latent dimensions like coherence and relevance.

Result: Found that binary 'slop' judgments are somewhat subjective but correlate with latent dimensions such as coherence and relevance. The framework can evaluate AI-generated text in detection and binary preference tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers new insights into linguistic and stylistic factors that contribute to quality judgments of AI-generated text, providing a means to assess and potentially improve AI text quality.

Abstract: AI "slop" is an increasingly popular term used to describe low-quality
AI-generated text, but there is currently no agreed upon definition of this
term nor a means to measure its occurrence. In this work, we develop a taxonomy
of "slop" through interviews with experts in NLP, writing, and philosophy, and
propose a set of interpretable dimensions for its assessment in text. Through
span-level annotation, we find that binary "slop" judgments are (somewhat)
subjective, but such determinations nonetheless correlate with latent
dimensions such as coherence and relevance. Our framework can be used to
evaluate AI-generated text in both detection and binary preference tasks,
potentially offering new insights into the linguistic and stylistic factors
that contribute to quality judgments.

### [51] [Soft Tokens, Hard Truths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19170)
*Natasha Butt,Ariel Kwiatkowski,Ismail Labiad,Julia Kempe,Yann Ollivier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable reinforcement learning method to train continuous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tokens, overcoming previous limitations of distillation-based approaches and enabling CoTs with hundreds of tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous tokens have greater expressivity than discrete tokens for reasoning paths, but practical use has been limited by training difficulties - previous methods either used continuous tokens only at inference or required costly distillation from discrete CoTs.

Method: Proposes using "soft" tokens (mixtures of tokens with noise on input embedding) for RL exploration. Uses reinforcement learning to learn continuous CoTs without distilling from reference discrete CoTs, with minimal computational overhead.

Result: On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, continuous CoT training matches discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpasses them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. Best performance comes from training with continuous CoT then using discrete tokens for inference.

Conclusion: Continuous CoT RL training provides a scalable method that preserves base model predictions better on out-of-domain tasks, offering a "softer touch" to the base model while enabling deployment in standard discrete-token format.

Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the
intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a
superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results
have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and
can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of
continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous
works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained
discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth
discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few
tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs
via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete
CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input
embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,
enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning
benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs
match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing
greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario
is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,
meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show
continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model
on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

*Xiaoqian Liu,Ke Wang,Yuchuan Wu,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Junge Zhang,Jianbin Jiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OPRL is a novel credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that learns implicit process rewards through trajectory preferences, combining step-level and episode-level advantages for more stable and efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse and unverifiable rewards in LLM-based agent training make temporal credit assignment challenging. Existing process supervision methods suffer from biased annotation, reward hacking, high variance, and failure in rare state overlap scenarios.

Method: OPRL alternates between optimizing an implicit process reward model (PRM) and the agent's policy, using trajectory-based DPO to convert trajectory preferences into step rewards. These step rewards compute step-level advantages, combined with episode-level outcome rewards for policy updates.

Result: OPRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across WebShop, VisualSokoban, and SOTOPIA benchmarks, showing superior sample efficiency, lower variance, and better exploration compared to frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines.

Conclusion: OPRL provides an effective solution for agentic learning in real-world scenarios by enabling stable training through implicit process reward learning and efficient exploration with fewer actions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in
interactive environments.
  However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit
assignment extremely challenging.
  Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but
suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly
fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare.
  We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general
credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with
standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or
explicit step labels.
  In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with
the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step
rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective.
  These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are
combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update,
creating a self-reinforcing loop.
  Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent
with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards,
providing bounded gradients to stabilize training.
  Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including
WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with
unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.
  Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL
baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher
sample-efficiency and lower variance during training.
  Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using
fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafeCoDe is a lightweight decoding framework that improves multimodal LLM safety by dynamically adjusting token generation based on visual context, balancing oversensitivity and undersensitivity through contrastive decoding and global-aware token modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with context-aware safety decisions, often failing to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals) and undersensitivity (missed visual risks), creating a persistent safety alignment gap.

Method: SafeCoDe uses a two-stage approach: (1) contrastive decoding that highlights visual context-sensitive tokens by comparing real vs Gaussian-noised images, and (2) global-aware token modulation that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustments for adaptive refusals.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks show SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.

Conclusion: SafeCoDe provides an effective model-agnostic solution for enhancing multimodal LLM safety by enabling dynamic, context-aware refusal decisions that balance safety and helpfulness.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety
decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance
oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity
(missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in
safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive
Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that
dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe
operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights
tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised
images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates
scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according
to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM
architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity,
oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe
consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving
model helpfulness.

*Tariq Abdul-Quddoos,Xishuang Dong,Lijun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of pre-trained attention-based models (BERT Base, BioBERT, Clinical BERT variants, RoBERTa, Clinical Longformer) on EHR information extraction tasks from n2c2 2022 challenges using CMED dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate which pre-trained attention-based models perform best for extracting medication-related information from Electronic Health Records, as these models have shown superior performance in clinical NLP but their comparative effectiveness on specific EHR tasks needs assessment.

Method: Fine-tuned various pre-trained models on CMED dataset for medication extraction, medical event detection, and medication event context classification. Applied processing methods to make EHRs compatible with models, and evaluated using recall, precision, and F1-score metrics.

Result: Models pre-trained on clinical data performed better for medication and medication event detection, while BERT Base (pre-trained on general domain data) was most effective for classifying medication event contexts.

Conclusion: Clinical domain pre-training benefits medication detection tasks, but general domain pre-training may be more effective for context classification, suggesting task-specific model selection is important for EHR information extraction.

Abstract: Attention-based models have become the leading approach in modeling medical
language for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in clinical notes. These models
outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual rep-
resentations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done
amongst pre- trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two
variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Long- former on task
related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks
from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges
(n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication
Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured
EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs.
The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting
contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using
data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED
to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and
multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Pro- cessing methods
are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied
models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on
constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics
including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models
pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and
medication events, but Bert Base, pre- trained on general domain data showed to
be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to
medications.

*Gabriele Berton,Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan,Son Tran,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompLLM is a soft context compression technique that divides long contexts into segments for independent compression, enabling linear scaling, scalability to 100k tokens, and reusability of compressed segments across queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face computational challenges with long contexts due to quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing soft compression methods compress context as a single unit, leading to quadratic complexity and inability to reuse computations.

Method: CompLLM divides context into segments and compresses each independently rather than processing holistically. This enables linear scaling, allows models trained on short sequences to generalize to long contexts, and supports caching/reuse of compressed segments.

Result: With 2x compression rate, CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token by up to 4x and reduces KV cache size by 50% at high context lengths. Performance is comparable to uncompressed context and even surpasses it on very long sequences.

Conclusion: CompLLM demonstrates effectiveness and practical utility for deploying LLMs with long contexts, offering significant efficiency gains while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when
processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.
While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent
representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited.
Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which
leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse
computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we
introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical
deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it
into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice
yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales
linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short
sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and
reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across
different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at
high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x
and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance
comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses
it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical
utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLPT is a new training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning on pre-training data to improve LLM capabilities without human annotation, achieving significant performance gains on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing gap between computational resources and high-quality text data limits traditional scaling approaches for LLMs, requiring new methods to optimize model capabilities.

Method: RLPT uses reinforcement learning with next-segment reasoning objectives, rewarding models for accurately predicting subsequent text segments from pre-training data, enabling autonomous exploration of meaningful trajectories.

Result: RLPT achieved substantial improvements on multiple benchmarks: 3.0-8.1 point gains on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25 with Qwen3-4B-Base, showing favorable scaling behavior.

Conclusion: RLPT extends LLM reasoning boundaries, provides a foundation for enhancing RLVR performance, and demonstrates strong potential for continued gains with more computational resources.

Abstract: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational
resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains
conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address
this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data
(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast
to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,
RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to
learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this
dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.
Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the
policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the
preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training
data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader
contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive
experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across
multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied
to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,
$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and
AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling
behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In
addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries
of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

### [57] [Extracting Conceptual Spaces from LLMs Using Prototype Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19269)
*Nitesh Kumar,Usashi Chatterjee,Steven Schockaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for extracting conceptual spaces from LLMs by encoding features through prototype descriptions and fine-tuning to align embeddings with conceptual dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conceptual spaces are valuable for explainable AI but difficult to learn from LLMs, despite LLMs capturing perceptual features well. Current embedding extraction methods don't properly encode the underlying features needed for conceptual spaces.

Method: Propose encoding features by embedding descriptions of corresponding prototypes (e.g., 'very sweet food' for sweetness). Fine-tune LLM to align prototype embeddings with conceptual space dimensions.

Result: Empirical analysis shows this approach is highly effective.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy successfully addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful conceptual spaces from LLMs by leveraging prototype-based feature encoding and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively
meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such
representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to
serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven
notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the
required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical
methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still
lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs,
extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying
features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g.
sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding
prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the
LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space
dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

Conclusion: The SloPalSpeech dataset effectively addresses data scarcity for Slovak ASR, and the authors publicly release the complete dataset, segmented transcripts (60 million words), and all fine-tuned models to foster future low-resource speech recognition research.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages like Slovak is
hindered by the scarcity of training data. To address this, we introduce
SloPalSpeech, a new, large-scale Slovak ASR dataset containing 2,806 hours of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces WolBanking77, a new intent classification dataset for Wolof language focusing on banking domain, addressing the gap in low-resource languages and spoken language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous intent classification research has focused primarily on high-resource languages, creating a significant gap for low-resource languages like Wolof which is spoken by over 10 million people in West Africa but has limited written resources, especially in regions with high illiteracy rates like Senegal.

Method: The authors created WolBanking77 dataset containing 9,791 text sentences and over 4 hours of spoken sentences in the banking domain. They conducted experiments using various state-of-the-art text and voice models as baselines.

Result: The results show promising performance on the dataset, with reported baseline f1-scores for NLP models and word error rates for ASR models. The paper provides detailed analyses of the dataset contents and model comparisons.

Conclusion: The release of WolBanking77 addresses the resource gap for Wolof language processing, with plans for ongoing dataset maintenance, updates, and open-source code release to support academic research in intent classification for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years.
However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets,
which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high
rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written.
This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\%
of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is
actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To
tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset
(WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77
currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4
hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in
this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are
very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed
analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word
error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77
dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct
dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.

Abstract: We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual
benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the
cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks
with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage
across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and
union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The
dataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines,
art forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range
of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models,
proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models,
across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key
limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded,
multimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented
traditions. DRISHTIKON fills a vital gap in inclusive AI research, offering a
robust testbed to advance culturally aware, multimodally competent language

Motivation: Colorectal cancer is a major global health concern, with polyps as key precursors. Manual polyp segmentation is labor-intensive and variable, while existing deep learning methods lack interpretability needed for clinical adoption.

Method: Integration of U-Net architecture with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for explainable polyp segmentation, trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of 1000 annotated endoscopic images.

Result: Achieved mean IoU of 0.9257 on test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96) on training/validation sets, with Grad-CAM confirming predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions.

Conclusion: PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable, trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy by coupling high segmentation accuracy with interpretability for improved early colorectal cancer prevention.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

*Xiuding Cai,Yaoyao Zhu,Linjie Fu,Dong Miao,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIM is a data-intrinsic regularization framework that uses inverse mapping to reconstruct inputs from transformed outputs, reducing information loss and improving gradient flow. The efficient ρSIM variant uses patch-level sampling and projection for lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional regularization techniques often rely on heuristics and are less reliable across diverse settings. There's a need for more effective, generalizable regularization methods.

Method: Self Identity Mapping (SIM) uses an inverse mapping mechanism to reconstruct inputs from outputs. ρSIM incorporates patch-level feature sampling and projection-based reconstruction to reduce computational complexity.

Result: ρSIM shows consistent improvements across image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization tasks. It preserves semantic information effectively and works well in dense-to-dense tasks and non-visual domains.

Conclusion: SIM is an effective, model-agnostic regularizer that can be seamlessly integrated into various architectures and tasks, demonstrating orthogonality to existing methods and broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly

Result: The proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts than baseline models, establishing a new performance benchmark.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal deep learning is effective for high-resolution deformation forecasting, with interpretability analysis showing baseline models default to simplistic patterns while the integrated approach captures complex dynamics.

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of

Motivation: Understanding information loss in multimodal AI systems is crucial for evaluating limitations, particularly the degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual intermediation in creative workflows.

Method: Generated 150 image pairs through describe-then-generate pipeline and applied existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, color distance) to measure information preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions.

Result: 99.3% of samples exhibited substantial perceptual degradation and 91.5% demonstrated significant structural information loss, showing consistent limitations in multimodal systems.

Conclusion: The describe-then-generate bottleneck represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal systems, providing empirical evidence of substantial information loss.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative

has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the
degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual
intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical
analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language
serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated
150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of detailed structural building information in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean, which is critical for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction

Method: Compare geospatial foundation models with shallow classifiers vs fine-tuned deep learning models for rooftop classification; assess impact of additional training data from neighboring regions

Result: Best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 for roof pitch classification and 0.83 for roof material classification

Conclusion: Combined with local capacity building, this work provides SIDS with novel capabilities to use AI and Earth Observation data for more efficient, evidence-based urban governance

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

TL;DR: VLA-LPAF is a lightweight module that improves VLA models' perspective adaptivity by fusing multiview observations in latent space using only 2D data, achieving significant performance improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models face perspective heterogeneity issues due to varied camera views across environments, which constrains their generality and performance.

Method: Proposed VLA-LPAF module finetuned with single-view images and fuses multiview observations in latent space; instantiated with RoboFlamingo as RoboFlamingo-LPAF.

Result: Achieves ~8% improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on customized simulation benchmark; demonstrates view-adaptive characteristics in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-LPAF effectively bridges perspective inconsistency gaps and enhances VLA model adaptability across diverse visual environments.

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visionerves is a hybrid AI framework that improves peripheral nerve recognition from MRI data using anatomical knowledge encoding and symbolic spatial reasoning, achieving significant improvements over standard tractography for endometriosis patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endometriosis causes chronic pelvic pain with potential nerve involvement, but current imaging methods struggle to visualize peripheral nerves effectively. Conventional tractography requires manual ROI selection and has limitations in nerve recognition.

Method: Two-phase hybrid AI framework: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using deep learning, and (B) tractography and nerve recognition through symbolic spatial reasoning that encodes fuzzy spatial relationships, eliminating need for manual ROIs.

Result: Tested on lumbosacral plexus in 10 women with endometriosis, Visionerves showed substantial improvements: Dice score improvements up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5mm compared to standard tractography.

Conclusion: The automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and provides a foundation for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy and other nerve-involved conditions.

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

TL;DR: V-SenseDrive is the first privacy-preserving multimodal driver behavior dataset collected in Pakistan, combining smartphone sensor data with road-facing video to capture diverse driving behaviors in real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road traffic accidents are a major public health challenge in countries like Pakistan with heterogeneous road conditions. Existing datasets lack representation from emerging economies and often violate privacy by recording drivers' faces.

Method: Data was collected using a custom Android app that captures high-frequency accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS streams, and synchronized road-facing video. The dataset covers three driving behaviors (normal, aggressive, risky) across urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways.

Result: V-SenseDrive provides a structured dataset with raw, processed, and semantic layers, enabling multimodal analysis of driver behavior while preserving privacy through road-facing video instead of driver-facing recording.

Conclusion: This dataset fills a critical gap in global driver behavior datasets by representing real-world driving in Pakistan, supporting future research in driver behavior classification, traffic safety analysis, and context-aware ADAS development.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly
in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and
variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe
driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions
in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this
work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection,
driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video
synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and
semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour
classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing
real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global
landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context
aware intelligent transportation solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for dehazing suffer from lack of paired real-world training data and domain gap issues, while traditional physics-based methods using Atmospheric Scattering Model struggle with real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns.

Method: Proposes HazeFlow, an ODE-based framework inspired by Rectified Flow that learns optimal ODE trajectories for dehazing. Also introduces non-homogeneous haze generation using Markov Chain Brownian Motion to create realistic training data.

Result: HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets with only a single inference step.

Conclusion: The ODE-based reformulation of atmospheric scattering model and realistic haze simulation through MCBM enable effective real-world dehazing, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical diagnoses increasingly use multimodal data, but models need to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while being robust to missing modalities, addressing real-world limitations like modality imbalance and missingness.

Method: Proposes learnable modality tokens for missingness-aware fusion and augments unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations using enhanced modality dropout and contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection and prediction, particularly in challenging scenarios with single modality availability. Successfully integrates with CT foundation models.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with significant potential for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning
models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while
remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art

single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of 9 segmentation architectures for pulmonary embolism (PE) segmentation using 490 CTPA scans, finding that 3D U-Net with ResNet encoder performs best, CNN models outperform ViT models, and pretraining can negatively impact segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conduct a comprehensive performance audit of various segmentation architectures for pulmonary embolism segmentation, comparing CNN and Vision Transformer models with different initialization strategies to identify optimal approaches for this clinically important task.

Method: Used a densely annotated in-house dataset of 490 CTPA scans to evaluate 9 segmentation architectures from CNN and ViT families, comparing pretrained vs. random weight initialization under a unified testing framework.

Result: Best model achieved mean Dice score of 0.7131, detecting 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false negatives on 60 test scans. Key findings: 3D U-Net with ResNet encoder is most effective, 3D models work well for PE morphology, CNNs outperform ViTs, pretraining can harm segmentation performance, and distal emboli remain challenging.

Conclusion: 3D CNN-based architectures, particularly 3D U-Net with ResNet encoder, are optimal for PE segmentation. PE classification and segmentation rely on different features, and distal emboli segmentation remains a challenge requiring better datasets and methods.

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490
CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used
segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

*Chun Kit Wong,Anders N. Christensen,Cosmin I. Bercea,Julia A. Schnabel,Martin G. Tolsgaard,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how classification task selection affects out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance in fetal ultrasound, showing that optimal task choice depends on the type of OOD shift (image characteristic vs anatomical feature).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable OOD detection is crucial for safe deployment of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound due to heterogeneous image characteristics and clinical settings. While existing research focuses on uncertainty quantification methods, this work examines the impact of the classification task itself on OOD detection performance.

Method: Conducted experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four classification tasks to evaluate OOD detection performance under different ID-OOD criteria (image characteristic shift vs anatomical feature shift).

Result: OOD detection performance significantly varies with the classification task, and the best task depends on the defined ID-OOD criteria. Superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained prediction.

Conclusion: Task selection and uncertainty strategies must be aligned with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis, as optimal OOD detection depends on the type of distribution shift and does not necessarily correlate with best abstained prediction performance.

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OrthoLoC is a large-scale dataset for aerial visual localization that uses orthographic geodata instead of heavy 3D models, addressing domain shifts between UAV imagery and geospatial data with a novel refinement technique called AdHoP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerial visual localization systems require high-precision localization with limited resources (no internet/GPS), making large image databases or 3D models impractical. Orthographic geodata is lightweight and increasingly available but underutilized.

Method: Created OrthoLoC dataset with 16,425 UAV images from Germany and US with multiple modalities. Introduced AdHoP refinement technique that can be integrated with any feature matcher to improve matching and reduce translation error.

Result: AdHoP improves matching by up to 95% and reduces translation error by up to 63%. The dataset enables fair benchmarking by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching.

Conclusion: Orthographic geodata is a viable alternative for aerial visual localization, and the proposed OrthoLoC dataset with AdHoP refinement significantly improves localization accuracy while being resource-efficient.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

*Mehrdad Moradi,Shengzhe Chen,Hao Yan,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSDnet is a zero-shot anomaly detection method that uses deep image prior for single-image anomaly localization without requiring training data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world scenarios lack training data for anomaly detection, requiring methods that work with only a single test image. Traditional approaches rely on training collections or reference samples, which may be unavailable.

Method: Proposes a patch-based training framework where the input image is directly fed into the network for self-reconstruction. Uses masking, patch shuffling, and Gaussian noise to prevent identity mapping. Employs perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity for better structure capture.

Result: Achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD, and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SSDnet provides an effective zero-shot anomaly localization solution that requires no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust to noise and missing pixels.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of grounding vision-language models in low-resource languages like Bengali, where models often produce fluent but incorrect text due to scarce paired data, translation alignment issues, and English-centric pretraining.

Method: Compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline with frozen MaxViT for visual patches, Bengali-native mBART-50 decoder, and lightweight bridge module. Core innovation is tri-loss objective combining Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) for patch descriptor alignment, InfoNCE for global real-synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based Optimal Transport for fine-grained patch correspondence.

Result: Significant improvements on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR 27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14, BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming CE baselines and reducing real-synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

Conclusion: The PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy effectively improves grounding accuracy in low-resource languages by combining patch-level alignment with global separation and fine-grained correspondence, demonstrating a scalable approach for multilingual vision-language modeling.

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,
BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the
real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

*Reeshad Khan,John Gauch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyBEV is a compact, real-time camera-only BEV framework that distills a large planning-oriented teacher model's capabilities into a lightweight 28M-parameter student model, achieving full-stack autonomy with 78% parameter reduction and 5x speed improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between large-scale multi-modal perception-planning models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy by creating a resource-efficient camera-only solution that retains full-stack driving intelligence.

Method: Uses model-agnostic multi-stage distillation combining feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to transfer knowledge from UniAD teacher to a lightweight BEV representation.

Result: Achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08 minADE for motion forecasting, 0.32 collision rate on nuScenes, running at 11 FPS with only camera input - 5x faster than baseline with 78% parameter reduction.

Conclusion: Full-stack driving intelligence can be effectively retained in resource-constrained settings through careful distillation, enabling real-time camera-only autonomy deployment.

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained
settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning
models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

*Thomas Gossard,Filip Radovic,Andreas Ziegler,Andrea Zell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new labeling strategy for motion-blurred balls in racket sports, placing labels at the center of blur streaks instead of leading edges, and presents BlurBall model that jointly detects ball position and motion blur attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing labeling conventions mark balls at the leading edge of motion blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring valuable motion cues correlated with velocity, which reduces detection accuracy.

Method: Proposed a new labeling strategy placing ball at center of blur streak with explicit blur attribute annotation. Developed BlurBall model using attention mechanisms (Squeeze-and-Excitation) over multi-frame inputs to jointly estimate ball position and motion blur attributes.

Result: The new labeling approach consistently enhances detection performance across various models. BlurBall achieves state-of-the-art results in ball detection and enables more reliable trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: Leveraging motion blur information not only improves ball detection accuracy but also benefits real-time sports analytics through better trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

*Binhua Huang,Ni Wang,Wendong Yao,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP is a training-free pipeline that uses motion vectors from compressed video to propagate open-vocabulary object detections from keyframes to intermediate frames, reducing computational cost while maintaining strong zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running large open-vocabulary detectors on every video frame is accurate but computationally expensive. The goal is to reduce detector invocations while preserving strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

Method: Uses OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors with 3x3 grid aggregation for translation and scale updates, plus area-growth check and optional single-class switch.

Result: On ILSVRC2015-VID: mAP@0.5=0.609, mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose IoU thresholds, close to framewise OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 vs 0.784/0.780). Outperforms tracker-based propagation methods and approaches supervised YOLOv12x performance while remaining label-free.

Conclusion: Compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to reduce detector invocations while maintaining strong zero-shot coverage in videos, offering a label-free and open-vocabulary alternative to supervised methods.

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is
accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

### [87] [Improving the color accuracy of lighting estimation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18390)
*Zitian Zhang,Joshua Urban Davis,Jeanne Phuong Anh Vu,Jiangtao Kuang,Jean-François Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates color robustness in HDR lighting estimation methods for AR applications, showing that simple preprocessing with a pre-trained white balance network improves color accuracy without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color robustness is a critical but often overlooked factor for achieving visual realism in augmented reality applications using HDR lighting estimation from single images.

Method: The study systematically evaluates adaptation strategies using a novel HDR dataset with diverse lighting colors, focusing on preprocessing techniques rather than developing new lighting estimation algorithms.

Result: Preprocessing input images with a pre-trained white balance network significantly improves color robustness across all tested scenarios, outperforming other adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: The white balance preprocessing approach is a simple yet effective method to enhance color accuracy in existing lighting estimation models, validated across three state-of-the-art methods without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

*Sourav Halder,Jinjun Tong,Xinyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework using vision language models for zero-shot detection of check fields to combat fraud without needing large labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Check fraud is a persistent problem in financial systems, but traditional detection methods require large labeled datasets that are scarce due to privacy concerns.

Method: Leverages vision language model (VLM) and multimodal large language model (MLLM) for zero-shot detection of critical check fields like signature, MICR line, amounts, payee, and payer.

Result: Quantitative evaluation on 110 diverse checks shows strong performance and generalization capability across different formats and layouts.

Conclusion: The framework enables deployment in real-world financial settings and can bootstrap high-quality labeled datasets for specialized real-time object detection models.

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

*Philip Wootaek Shin,Jack Sampson,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan,Andres Marquez,Mahantesh Halappanavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with distorted charts and complex reasoning, showing performance drops and hallucinations under corruption/occlusion. CHART NOISe dataset introduced to benchmark robustness with corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assume clean charts and simple queries, but real-world charts often contain distortions and require complex reasoning beyond fact matching.

Method: Evaluated ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on chart understanding under corruption/occlusion. Created CHART NOISe dataset combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and multiple-choice questions with prompt reverse inconsistency testing.

Result: Sharp performance drops under corruption/occlusion, with increased hallucinations (value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, entity confusion). Models remain overconfident in degraded settings.

Conclusion: Established rigorous testbed for chart understanding robustness. Proposed baseline mitigation strategies like quality filtering and occlusion detection to advance reliability in chart reasoning.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet
existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world
charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching.
We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp
performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as
value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more
frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating
plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,
and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset
combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm
versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness
and reliability in chart understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural representation framework for 4D-MRI reconstruction that replaces conventional phase binning with continuous deformation modeling using two networks: a Spatial Anatomy Network for 3D anatomy and a Temporal Motion Network guided by respiratory signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional 4D-MRI reconstruction methods struggle with temporal variability, complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. They rely on phase binning or separate template scans which are inefficient.

Method: Uses two synergistic networks: Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes continuous 3D anatomical representation, and Temporal Motion Network (TMN) produces deformation fields guided by Transformer-derived respiratory signals. The framework considers respiratory motion as smooth, continuous deformation steered by 1D surrogate signal.

Result: Reduces processing time from ~5 hours to 15 minutes of training, enables inference of each 3D volume in under 1 second. Accurately captures regular and irregular respiratory patterns while preserving vessel and bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. Superior performance compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The template- and phase-free method significantly improves efficiency and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment, enabling accurate reconstruction of 3D images at any respiratory state.

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

*Prithvi Raj Singh,Raju Gottumukkala,Anthony Maida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of five Kalman filter-based tracking methods for fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs, showing DeepOCSORT has lowest error but all methods suffer significant tracking drift with 3-11cm spatial errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs present unique tracking challenges due to unpredictable movement patterns and small visual marks, which are particularly relevant for sport robotics applications where accurate tracking can improve robot perception and planning.

Method: Evaluated five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods (OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, StrongSORT) using a custom dataset of 10,000 annotated racquetball frames at 720p-1280p resolution, focusing on inference speed and update frequency per image.

Result: DeepOCSORT achieved lowest tracking error (ADE: 31.15 pixels) while ByteTrack was fastest (26.6ms inference time). However, all trackers showed significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging 3-11cm (ADE: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations for unpredictable motion patterns.

Conclusion: Current Kalman filter-based tracking approaches have error rates 3-4x higher than standard benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications due to fundamental limitations in handling unpredictable motion.

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve video action recognition efficiency by leveraging readily available motion vectors in compressed video formats to focus computational resources on relevant motion regions rather than processing entire frames.

Method: A lightweight pipeline with denoising & merge (DM), Monte Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via motion-density submatrix search to identify optimal crop regions from motion vectors without additional training.

Result: Significant improvements: +3.5% Top-1 accuracy at equal FLOPs or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer FLOPs on UCF101; achieves 89.2% accuracy at original cost and 88.5% accuracy with reduced compute (11.6 to 8.5 GFLOPs) on CoViAR.

Conclusion: MoCrop demonstrates strong generality across diverse backbones (ResNet-50, MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, Swin-B) and is practical for real-time deployment in compressed domain video analysis.

Abstract: We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient
video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors
that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a
single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module
is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse
backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte
Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix
search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6
to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAFC-SE is a codebook-based adaptive feature compression framework that uses vector quantization to map visual features to discrete indices, enabling better analysis performance under low-bitrate conditions compared to traditional image compression and feature compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image compression methods for edge-cloud systems perform poorly under low-bitrate conditions - they either retain redundant details in reconstructed images or learn over-concentrated symbol distributions in feature compression, leading to suboptimal analysis performance.

Method: Proposes CAFC-SE framework that uses vector quantization to map continuous visual features to discrete indices via a codebook, selectively transmitting them to the cloud. This preserves more informative visual patterns by projecting feature vectors onto nearest visual primitives.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority in terms of rate and accuracy compared to existing methods, showing the framework is less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions.

Conclusion: The codebook-based adaptive feature compression with semantic enhancement effectively addresses low-bitrate challenges in edge-cloud systems by preserving essential visual patterns through vector quantization.

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an ultra-lightweight segmentation solution for medical imaging that can operate in resource-limited settings like point-of-care devices, addressing the need for real-time, high-fidelity diagnostics with minimal computational requirements.

Method: Uses multi-kernel depth-wise convolution blocks (MKDC) to process images through multiple kernels and capture multi-resolution spatial relationships, combined with sophisticated attention mechanisms including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention.

Result: Outperforms TransUNet with 333× fewer parameters and 123× fewer FLOPs, beats UNeXt with up to 6.7% higher DICE score and 4.7× fewer parameters, and surpasses other lightweight networks like MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet across six binary medical imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: MK-UNet represents a paradigm shift in medical image segmentation, offering unparalleled computational efficiency and superior performance, making it ideal for real-time diagnostics in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards
ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image
segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution
block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels,
while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also
emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention
mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our
MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M
parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but
also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with
4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent
lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with
much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with
drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for
real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such
as point-of-care devices. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: Existing source-free domain adaptation methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels when optimizing entire label sets simultaneously, limiting self-training effectiveness.

Method: DGLE framework: 1) Confidence filtering and super-resolution fusion to get high-quality seed pseudo-labels, 2) Diffusion model propagation to generate complete high-quality labels from seeds.

Result: The method avoids direct optimization challenges with noisy pseudo-labels, significantly improves pseudo-label quality, and enhances target domain model performance.

Conclusion: DGLE effectively addresses SFDA limitations by starting from quality seeds and propagating via diffusion models, overcoming noise issues in traditional pseudo-label optimization approaches.

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

*Jiaxin Dai,Xiang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using hyperbolic space embeddings to improve Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) by better representing hierarchical data and mitigating overfitting with limited samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic space offers superior representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to Euclidean space. The authors aim to enhance the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm in C2FSCIL by leveraging hyperbolic geometry to better capture hierarchical relationships between coarse and fine classes.

Method: The method embeds the feature extractor into hyperbolic space using the Poincaré ball model, transforming input images into hyperbolic feature vectors. It introduces hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers for optimization and classification. To address few-shot limitations, it implements maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to generate augmented features and prevent overfitting.

Result: Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space embedding provides an effective framework for C2FSCIL tasks, enabling better hierarchical representation learning and improved performance in few-shot scenarios through hyperbolic geometry and feature augmentation techniques.

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior
representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional
Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot
Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

*Zixin Zhu,Haoxiang Li,Xuelu Feng,He Wu,Chunming Qiao,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-aware two-stage framework for intelligent object removal that addresses causal visual artifacts by decoupling geometry removal and appearance rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods fail to remove causal visual artifacts (shadows, reflections) that aren't explicitly masked, or lack controllability and may over-erase other objects due to ignoring the causal relationship between object geometry and visual effects.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Geometry removal stage using strictly mask-aligned supervision to remove objects from depth/geometry with strong constraints, (2) Appearance rendering stage that generates photorealistic RGB images from updated geometry. Uses preference-driven objective with positive/negative sample pairs to guide learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware approach effectively addresses limitations of appearance-based methods by considering causal relationships between object geometry and visual effects, enabling more intelligent and controllable object removal.

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at

*Yujia Liu,Dingquan Li,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEGA is a transferable black-box attack method for NR-IQA models that uses Gaussian smoothing and ensemble gradients to improve transferability while maintaining imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing white-box attacks on NR-IQA models have poor transferability to black-box scenarios where target models are inaccessible, limiting their practical utility.

Method: SEGA approximates target model gradients by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models and ensembling their smoothed gradients, with a perturbation filter mask to ensure imperceptibility.

Result: Experimental results on CLIVE dataset show SEGA achieves superior transferability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SEGA successfully enables transfer-based black-box attacks against NR-IQA models by addressing the low transferability challenge.

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role
in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

*Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaSmileNet is a novel feature fusion framework that integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded D-Markers using parameter-free multiplicative interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results in smile emotion recognition while reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task learning frameworks for smile emotion recognition suffer from computational inefficiencies due to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. There's a need for more efficient methods that can effectively combine deep learning with domain knowledge.

Method: The paper introduces HadaSmileNet, which directly integrates transformer-based representations with D-Marker features through Hadamard multiplicative fusion. The approach was systematically evaluated across 15 different fusion strategies.

Result: HadaSmileNet achieved state-of-the-art results: UvA-NEMO (88.7%, +0.8), MMI (99.7%), SPOS (98.5%, +0.7), and BBC (100%, +5.0). It also demonstrated 26% parameter reduction and simplified training compared to multi-task alternatives.

Conclusion: The Hadamard multiplicative fusion approach provides optimal performance by enabling direct feature interactions while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical deployment in real-time affective computing applications.

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental
pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining
applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining
deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial
emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due
to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This
paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly
integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded
D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

### [101] [Event-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Human and Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18566)
*Xiaoting Yin,Hao Shi,Kailun Yang,Jiajun Zhai,Shangwei Guo,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel event-guided framework for joint human-scene reconstruction from monocular event cameras using 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing motion blur in fast motion scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB frames suffer from motion blur in fast motion scenarios, making dynamic human reconstruction difficult. Event cameras offer microsecond temporal resolution advantages for capturing high-speed movements.

Method: Uses unified 3D Gaussians with learnable semantic attributes; only human-classified Gaussians undergo deformation while scene Gaussians remain static. Introduces event-guided loss that matches simulated brightness changes with event streams to combat blur.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction on ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur datasets, with significant improvements in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Conclusion: The framework effectively eliminates need for external human masks and simplifies Gaussian set management, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic human reconstruction under fast motion conditions.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

*Yuhan Wang,Cheng Liu,Zihan Zhao,Weichao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Live-E2T is a novel framework for real-time threat monitoring that achieves both high performance and explainability through semantic tuple decomposition, online event deduplication, and LLM-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing threat monitoring methods struggle to simultaneously meet real-time performance requirements and provide explainable decision-making, creating a gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Three synergistic mechanisms: 1) Deconstructing video frames into Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples for compact representation, 2) Online event deduplication and updating to filter redundancies, 3) Fine-tuning LLMs with Chain-of-Thought strategy for transparent reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets show Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and explainability.

Conclusion: Live-E2T successfully bridges the gap between real-time performance and explainability in threat monitoring through its unified framework design.

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

*Daiqing Qi,Handong Zhao,Jing Shi,Simon Jenni,Yifei Fan,Franck Dernoncourt,Scott Cohen,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhotoCritique dataset, PhotoEye model, and PhotoBench benchmark to enhance aesthetic visual understanding in MLLMs, addressing the gap between general object recognition and professional aesthetic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental distinction between general visual understanding (object detection, localization) and aesthetic visual understanding (color, lighting, composition). Current MLLMs lack the expertise needed for professional photo analysis, requiring photographic techniques and processing knowledge.

Method: 1) Created PhotoCritique dataset from discussions among professional photographers; 2) Developed PhotoEye model with language-guided multi-view vision fusion; 3) Established PhotoBench benchmark for comprehensive aesthetic evaluation.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models on both existing benchmarks and the new PhotoBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in aesthetic visual understanding by providing specialized datasets, models, and benchmarks that incorporate professional photographic expertise.

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method
leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors
across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates
memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high
segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated
data. Unfortunately, the detailed experimental records have been lost,
preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods insufficiently model spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, leading to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency details in multi-contrast MRI super-resolution.

Method: Proposes Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model (SSCM) with three key components: Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast spatial alignment, Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range semantic consistency, and Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure restoration.

Result: Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and semantically consistent reconstructions.

Conclusion: SSCM effectively addresses the challenges of maintaining spatial-semantic consistency in multi-contrast MRI super-resolution, providing superior reconstruction quality with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and

TL;DR: OraPO with FactScore-based reward enables efficient radiology report generation using single-stage RL training and lightweight oracle supervision, achieving SOTA performance with dramatically reduced data and computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiology report generation methods require large-scale multi-stage training with oversized models, making them data- and compute-intensive. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach that works under constrained budgets.

Method: Proposes Oracle-educated GRPO (OraPO) with FactScore-based reward (FactS). OraPO enables single-stage RL-only training by converting failed explorations into preference supervision via a lightweight oracle. FactS extracts atomic clinical facts and checks entailment against ground truth for dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards.

Result: Achieves new SOTA performance on CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 F1) with 2-3 orders of magnitude less training data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

Conclusion: The OraPO and FactS framework creates a compact and powerful solution that significantly improves learning efficiency on clinically challenging cases while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMSF is a training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference styles in diffusion models through adaptive semantic token decomposition and similarity-aware re-weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reference-based methods are limited to single style images and lack principled mechanisms to balance multiple stylistic influences, preventing hybrid aesthetics and scalability.

Method: Encodes all style images and textual hints with semantic token decomposition module adaptively injected into cross-attention layers, with similarity-aware re-weighting that recalibrates attention to each style component at every denoising step.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show AMSF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in multi-style fusion and scales seamlessly to two or more styles.

Conclusion: AMSF represents a practical step toward expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models without requiring fine-tuning or external adapters.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

### [108] [MLF-4DRCNet: Multi-Level Fusion with 4D Radar and Camera for 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18613)
*Yuzhi Wu,Li Xiao,Jun Liu,Guangfeng Jiang,XiangGen Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLF-4DRCNet is a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection using multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images, addressing limitations of existing radar-camera fusion methods by incorporating point-, scene-, and proposal-level integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D radar is cost-effective and robust for autonomous driving but suffers from sparse and noisy point clouds. Existing fusion methods designed for LiDAR-camera fusion neglect radar's inherent drawbacks and restrict fusion to coarse scene-level integration.

Method: Proposes MLF-4DRCNet with three key modules: Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) for point-level fusion, Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP) for scene-level fusion using deformable attention, and Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) for refining region proposals by fusing image features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets, with performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset.

Conclusion: The multi-level fusion approach effectively addresses radar's sparsity and noise limitations, demonstrating that comprehensive feature representation through point-, scene-, and proposal-level fusion enables 4D radar to achieve performance competitive with LiDAR-based systems.

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

### [109] [Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering for Inversion Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18619)
*Yichen Wu,Xu Liu,Chenxuan Zhao,Xinyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDLS is a training-free framework that uses dual latent steering to improve image inversion in diffusion models, balancing structural fidelity and semantic accuracy without per-image optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods encoding images into single latent vectors struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading to semantic drift issues like blurred details or incorrect attributes in reconstructions.

Method: PDLS decomposes inversion into two complementary streams: structural path for source integrity and semantic path guided by prompts. It formulates dual guidance as an optimal control problem solved via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to dynamically steer the generative trajectory.

Result: Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K and ImageNet-1K show PDLS produces reconstructions more faithful to original images and better aligned with semantic information than single-latent baselines across various inversion tasks.

Conclusion: PDLS effectively prevents semantic drift while preserving fine details through its dual latent steering approach, outperforming existing methods without requiring costly per-image optimization.

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

TL;DR: Prima is a vision language model for neuroimaging that uses hierarchical architecture trained on 220,000+ MRI studies, achieving 92.0 mean AUC across 52 neurological diagnoses and outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing demand for MRI studies that strains health systems, prolongs turnaround times, and disproportionately affects low-resource and rural settings.

Method: Developed Prima using a large academic health system as a data engine, with hierarchical vision architecture trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, tested in a 1-year health system-wide study including 30K MRI studies.

Result: Achieved mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0 across 52 radiologic diagnoses from major neurological disorders, outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models.

Conclusion: Prima demonstrates transformative potential for health system-scale VLMs in advancing AI-driven healthcare, offering explainable diagnoses, worklist prioritization, and fairness across diverse patient demographics.

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological
diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has
risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

TL;DR: UiG is a novel reasoning framework that integrates understanding capabilities into the generation process for text-to-image models, using image editing as a bridge to enhance generation quality step by step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought methods separate understanding and generation processes, limiting their ability to guide unified models in addressing generative capability deficiencies.

Method: Proposes Understanding-in-Generation (UiG) framework that uses image editing to infuse understanding into generation. It verifies generated images, incorporates model understanding into editing instructions, and enhances images step by step.

Result: Significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation, achieving 3.92% gain on long prompt setting of TIIF benchmark compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UiG effectively bridges the gap between understanding and generation in unified models, demonstrating superior performance by integrating understanding capabilities directly into the generative process.

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG
framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image
generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on
the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark. The project code:

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark for depth estimation models on endoscopic images and introduces EndoSynth, a synthetic dataset that improves model accuracy when used for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of robust benchmarks and high-quality datasets for depth estimation in endoscopic images, despite recent advancements in foundation models.

Method: The authors created a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art depth estimation models evaluated on real endoscopic images, and developed EndoSynth - a synthetic dataset with ground truth metric depth and segmentation masks.

Result: Fine-tuning depth foundation models using the synthetic EndoSynth dataset significantly boosts accuracy on most unseen real endoscopic data.

Conclusion: This work provides both a benchmark and synthetic dataset to advance depth estimation for endoscopic images, serving as an important resource for future research.

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in
the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in
particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the
domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and
high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF-Mamba is a novel state space model for RGB-D salient object detection that addresses limitations of CNNs and Vision Transformers by combining local emphatic SSM modules with adaptive fusion mechanisms for efficient cross-modality integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-D SOD methods using CNNs have limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers suffer from quadratic complexity. State space models like Mamba offer linear complexity but may lack local semantics and effective cross-modality fusion.

Method: Proposes LEAF-Mamba with two key components: 1) Local Emphatic State Space Module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for RGB and depth modalities, 2) SSM-based Adaptive Fusion Module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show LEAF-Mamba outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency. Also demonstrates excellent performance on RGB-T SOD task, proving strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: LEAF-Mamba successfully balances performance and computational efficiency for RGB-D SOD by leveraging state space models with enhanced local semantics and adaptive cross-modality fusion, showing promising generalization to other multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight food image classification algorithm combining Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism and Spatial Attention Mechanism to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food image classification is crucial for automated quality control and food safety, but Vision Transformer models face challenges with large parameters and high computational complexity, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Proposes a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) to capture local/global features efficiently through window partitioning, and Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM) to emphasize key spatial regions for better feature representation.

Result: Achieved 95.24% accuracy on Food-101 and 94.33% on Vireo Food-172 datasets, with significant reductions in parameters and FLOPs compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances computational efficiency and classification performance, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: OSDA successfully addresses key challenges in open-world remote sensing interpretation by combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level semantic understanding, supporting robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery.

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to
achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization.
This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated

segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PlantCLEF 2021 challenge that addresses automated plant identification in biodiversity-rich but data-poor tropical regions by leveraging herbarium collections to improve cross-domain classification from herbarium sheets to field photos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated plant identification systems are biased toward North America and Europe, while biodiversity-rich tropical regions lack sufficient field photo data. Herbarium collections contain centuries of botanical data from these regions that could bridge this gap.

Method: Cross-domain classification task using a dataset of ~1,000 species from the Guiana Shield region. Training set combines hundreds of thousands of herbarium sheets with thousands of field photos, plus morphological/functional trait metadata. Test set consists exclusively of field photos.

Result: The challenge evaluated automated identification systems' ability to transfer knowledge from herbarium specimens to field conditions, assessing performance on real-world field photo identification.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of leveraging historical herbarium collections to improve plant identification in data-scarce tropical regions, providing a framework for cross-domain learning between herbarium and field domains.

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent
advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and
more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of
thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much
less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical
countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have
systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,
especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity
informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised
records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF
2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the
resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the
approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides
an analysis of the main results.

TL;DR: AGSwap is a novel method for cross-category object fusion in text-to-image generation that addresses issues like biased results and visual chaos through adaptive feature manipulation and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fusing cross-category objects in T2I generation often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration. The field also lacks comprehensive benchmark datasets.

Method: AGSwap consists of two components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping that fuses semantic attributes through feature manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism guided by a balance evaluation score. The paper also introduces COF, a large-scale dataset with 451,250 unique fusion pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments show that AGSwap outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1, on both simple and complex prompts.

Conclusion: AGSwap provides an effective solution for coherent cross-category object fusion in T2I generation, with the COF dataset serving as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained
increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad
applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However,
existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically
inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration.
Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a
comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose
\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1
using simple and complex prompts.

Conclusion: The PlantCLEF 2019 challenge provided valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current automated plant identification systems for data-deficient regions, highlighting progress and remaining challenges in biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data.
However, this profusion of data only concerns a few tens of thousands of

TL;DR: RSVG-ZeroOV is a training-free framework for zero-shot open-vocabulary remote sensing visual grounding that leverages frozen foundation models without fine-tuning, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RSVG approaches are limited to closed-set vocabularies and require expensive datasets and fine-tuning. The goal is to enable open-world applicability without costly training procedures.

Method: Three-stage framework: (i) Overview using VLM for cross-attention maps, (ii) Focus using diffusion model for structural/shape information, (iii) Evolve with attention evolution module to purify segmentation masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show RSVG-ZeroOV consistently outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods without requiring task-specific training.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for open-vocabulary RSVG by effectively leveraging frozen foundation models.

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

### [120] [What Makes You Unique? Attribute Prompt Composition for Object Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18715)
*Yingquan Wang,Pingping Zhang,Chong Sun,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework for Object Re-Identification that uses textual semantics to enhance both discrimination and generalization, addressing limitations of single-domain and cross-domain models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ReID models are limited to either single-domain (overfitting to domain-specific features) or cross-domain scenarios (suppressing identity-specific cues through normalization strategies). The authors aim to develop a framework that can effectively balance ReID-specific discrimination with generalizable representation learning.

Method: The APC framework includes an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) with Semantic Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and Prompt Composition Module (PCM) to generate discriminative attribute-aware features. It also employs a Fast-Slow Training Strategy (FSTS) with Fast Update Stream (FUS) for ReID-specific knowledge and Slow Update Stream (SUS) to retain generalizable knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models.

Result: Extensive experiments on conventional and Domain Generalized ReID datasets show that the framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance in both discrimination and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed APC framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing ReID models by leveraging textual semantics and a balanced training strategy, achieving better performance in real-world scenarios requiring both discrimination and generalization.

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The

### [121] [Pre-training CLIP against Data Poisoning with Optimal Transport-based Matching and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18717)
*Tong Zhang,Kuofeng Gao,Jiawang Bai,Leo Yu Zhang,Xin Yin,Zonghui Wang,Shouling Ji,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTCCLIP is an Optimal Transport-based framework that defends against poisoning attacks on CLIP models by reconstructing image-caption pairs using fine-grained feature alignment instead of relying solely on global representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous defense methods for CLIP poisoning attacks only use global image-caption representations, which overlook fine-grained features and can introduce incorrect pairs that harm pre-training performance.

Method: Proposes an optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets to reassign captions, and uses optimal transport-based objective functions to encourage inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment.

Result: OTCCLIP successfully decreases attack success rates of poisoning attacks and significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance on poisoned datasets compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The optimal transport-based approach effectively addresses limitations of previous defense methods by leveraging fine-grained feature alignment for more robust image-caption pair reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

*Yilin Gao,Kangyi Chen,Zhongxing Peng,Hengjie Lu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LFI is a cognitive-inspired framework that enables better knowledge transfer from vision language models to visual foundation models by modeling visual understanding as an interactive process rather than just using result-oriented approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual foundation models struggle to effectively transfer knowledge from vision language models because they focus on final results rather than the underlying interaction processes that VLMs excel at modeling through cross-modal representations.

Method: The approach uses Interaction Queries to maintain persistent relational structures across network layers and interaction-based supervision derived from cross-modal attention mechanisms of pre-trained VLMs.

Result: Achieved significant improvements: 3.3 and 1.6 mAP/2.4 AP gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO detection/segmentation, with 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Also showed 2.7x better semantic consistency in human evaluations.

Conclusion: LFI framework enables more faithful and efficient knowledge transfer by capturing dynamic interaction patterns from VLMs, leading to better generalization across diverse vision tasks with minimal parameter overhead and faster convergence.

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

*Ruichao Hou,Xingyuan Li,Tongwei Ren,Dongming Zhou,Gangshan Wu,Jinde Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyPSAM is a novel hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model for RGB-thermal salient object detection that leverages SAM's zero-shot capabilities with dynamic fusion and plug-and-play refinement networks to overcome feature fusion and data scarcity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-T SOD faces challenges in learning precise boundaries and complete objects due to insufficient feature fusion between modalities and data scarcity limitations. The paper aims to leverage SAM's generalization capabilities to address these issues.

Method: Proposes HyPSAM with two main components: 1) Dynamic Fusion Network (DFNet) using dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding for adaptive cross-modality interaction, and 2) Plug-and-play Refinement Network (P2RNet) that uses hybrid prompts (text, mask, box) to guide SAM in refining saliency maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. HyPSAM shows remarkable versatility by integrating with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains.

Conclusion: The method highlights the potential of prompt engineering in RGB-T SOD, offering a flexible framework that can be combined with various existing approaches to improve salient object detection performance.

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The

*Susmit Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriFusion-AE is a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates text, depth maps, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness against noise and adversarial attacks in autonomous driving perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw LiDAR point clouds are vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial corruptions, and existing autoencoders degrade under challenging real-world conditions.

Method: Uses multimodal cross-attention to align semantic cues from text, geometric features from depth maps, and spatial structure from LiDAR for resilient representation learning. The framework is model-agnostic and integrates with CNN-based autoencoders.

Result: Achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise where CNN-based autoencoders collapse, though shows limited gains under mild perturbations.

Conclusion: The multimodal fusion framework enables seamless integration with existing CNN-based point cloud autoencoders for improved robustness in low-data deployment scenarios like autonomous driving.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with
any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

*Yuyang Liu,Xinyuan Shi,Bang Yang,Peilin Zhou,Jiahua Dong,Long Chen,Ian Reid,Xiaondan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLT enhances open-source video LLMs with continuous tool usage capabilities, enabling automatic acquisition of tool-use abilities in evolving tool streams without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video LLM methods assume fixed tool repositories and struggle with real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in.

Method: COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as tool-specific memory, dynamically selecting relevant tools based on similarity between user instruction and tool features. Uses VideoToolBench dataset for instruction tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset.

Conclusion: COLT successfully enables continuous tool usage in video LLMs, overcoming limitations of existing methods in handling evolving tool streams.

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

*Zhaorui Wang,Yi Gu,Deming Zhou,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixingGS is a training-free method that enhances sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction by using diffusion models to provide accurate, multi-view consistent priors for artifact removal and inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods struggle with sparse viewpoint reconstruction, leading to artifacts and poor multi-view consistency when using generative priors for completion.

Method: Proposes FixingGS with a distillation approach that delivers accurate cross-view coherent diffusion priors, and an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme for refining under-constrained regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show FixingGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods with superior visual quality and reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: FixingGS effectively addresses sparse-view 3DGS limitations through training-free diffusion model utilization, achieving better artifact removal and multi-view consistency.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-VLM proposes a novel quantization method for vision-language models that separates weights into outlier and inlier subsets based on Gaussian quantiles, enabling ultra-low-bit precision (≤2 bits) while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have substantial computational costs and memory requirements that restrict their use in hardware-constrained environments. There's a critical gap between computational demands and the ultra-low-bit weight precision needed for higher efficiency.

Method: Proposes Bi-VLM with non-uniform weight separation based on Gaussian quantiles, grouping weights into outlier (salient) and multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets. Uses saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm with different constraints on scaler and binary matrices based on saliency metrics and compression objectives.

Result: For language model part: outperforms SOTA by 3%-47% on visual question answering across four benchmarks and three models. For overall VLM: outperforms SOTA by 4%-45%. Also identified 90%-99% redundancy in image tokens, enabling further visual token pruning.

Conclusion: Bi-VLM successfully bridges the gap between computational demands and ultra-low-bit precision, achieving significant efficiency improvements while maintaining or improving performance on vision-language tasks.

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

*Azad Singh,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiSSECT is a self-supervised learning framework that uses multi-scale vector quantization to create discrete representational bottlenecks, improving feature learning for medical imaging by suppressing shortcut learning and enhancing transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods for medical imaging rely on complex architectures, anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, making them prone to shortcut learning and limiting scalability, especially in modalities like chest X-rays where anatomical similarity is high and pathology is subtle.

Method: DiSSECT integrates multi-scale vector quantization into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck, which constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns.

Result: The framework achieves strong performance on both classification and segmentation tasks with minimal or no fine-tuning, showing particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes across multiple public medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: DiSSECT demonstrates robustness and generalizability superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches, providing an efficient solution for clinical transferable representations in medical imaging.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: A real-time deer detection and warning system using thermal imaging, deep learning, and vehicle-to-everything communication to reduce deer-vehicle collisions with high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deer-vehicle collisions cause significant safety issues (2.1M incidents annually, 440 fatalities, 59K injuries, $10B damages) and contribute to declining deer populations.

Method: Integration of thermal imaging, deep learning on custom dataset of 12,000 thermal deer images, and CV2X communication for real-time detection and driver warnings.

Result: Exceptional performance: 98.84% mAP, 95.44% precision, 95.96% recall; robust operation across weather conditions (88-92% accuracy vs <60% for visible light cameras); end-to-end latency under 100ms.

Conclusion: Establishes viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles, validated by successful field testing.

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

TL;DR: SAADi is a framework that aligns diffusion models with downstream surgical vision tasks by fine-tuning on preferred vs non-preferred synthetic image pairs, improving classification and segmentation performance while addressing data memorization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in surgical deep learning by overcoming diffusion model memorization problems that lead to inconsistent/non-diverse synthetic samples which can harm downstream performance.

Method: Constructs preferred/non-preferred synthetic image pairs and performs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align generation with downstream objectives. Uses iterative refinement of synthetic samples.

Result: Consistent gains of 7-9% in classification and 2-10% in segmentation across three surgical datasets, with significant improvements for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement boosts performance by 4-10%.

Conclusion: SAADi overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity in surgical vision applications.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

### [131] [Failure Makes the Agent Stronger: Enhancing Accuracy through Structured Reflection for Reliable Tool Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18847)
*Junhao Su,Yuanliang Wan,Junwei Yang,Hengyu Shi,Tianyang Han,Junfeng Luo,Yurui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tool-augmented LLMs trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained RL often fail in multi-turn interactions by repeating mistakes. This paper proposes structured reflection as an explicit, trainable action for error diagnosis and repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-reflection methods rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning, which are fragile in multi-turn tool interactions where models often repeat the same errors after failures.

Method: Proposes structured reflection with Reflect-Call-Final strategy, combining DAPO and GSPO objectives with tailored rewards. Uses Tool-Reflection-Bench for evaluation with programmatic checks of structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency.

Result: Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success, error recovery, and reduction of redundant calls.

Conclusion: Making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves tool interaction reliability and provides a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic PET imaging faces challenges in achieving high image quality due to limited statistics in short temporal frames, requiring effective denoising methods.

Method: Proposes KMDS-Net, a model-based neural network that uses inter-frame spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency to establish a kernel space-based multidimensional sparse model, with neural networks substituting parameter estimation for adaptive optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real data show KMDS-Net outperforms baseline methods in denoising performance for dynamic PET.

Conclusion: The method effectively achieves high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic PET and the source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission
tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the
short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a
wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video benchmarks focus on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving long-distance travel challenges unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs in real-world tasks like embodied-AI planning and navigation.

Method: The authors present VIR-Bench, a benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging evaluation task. They also develop a prototype travel-planning agent leveraging insights from VIR-Bench.

Result: Experimental results show that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores on VIR-Bench, highlighting the difficulty of handling videos spanning extended spatial and temporal scales.

Conclusion: VIR-Bench effectively benchmarks MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence and translates into concrete performance gains, as demonstrated by the prototype travel-planning agent's improved itinerary recommendations.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new
possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus
largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

*Garam Kim,Tae Kyeong Jeong,Juyoun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation with multi-task learning to address temporal-spatial imbalance in robot-assisted surgery visual data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding. Current approaches suffer from temporal-spatial imbalance where long-term annotations are available for every frame but short-term annotations are only provided for key frames.

Method: Uses optical flow estimated from annotated key frames to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, enriching sparse spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for multi-task learning training.

Result: The integration improves both accuracy and efficiency of surgical scene understanding.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the utility of robot-assisted surgery by providing better visual data understanding through balanced temporal-spatial supervision.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Method: Uses a divide-and-conquer strategy with speculative decoding for next-token prediction and multi-stage distillation for diffusion denoising. Combines advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning.

Result: Achieves over 2x speedup in multimodal understanding, 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation, and 22x speedup in image editing. The 1-NFE model enables near real-time interactive editing and generation.

Conclusion: Hyper-Bagel provides substantial performance gains while preserving output quality, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous with ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

TL;DR: Citrus-V is a multimodal medical foundation model that integrates detection, segmentation, and chain-of-thought reasoning for comprehensive medical image analysis and diagnostic inference in a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical imaging models are too narrow and specialized, requiring multiple networks which limits generalization. Clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and reasoning capabilities that current models lack.

Method: Proposes a novel multimodal training approach combining image analysis with textual reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and diagnostic inference. Releases an open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.

Result: Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning.

Conclusion: The model supports precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions, providing a comprehensive solution for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second
opinions.

*Gianmarco Spinaci,Lukas Klic,Giovanni Colavizza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates multimodal LLMs and VLMs for Christian iconography classification, comparing them against ResNet50 baselines across three datasets under different prompting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether general-purpose multimodal models can interpret Christian iconography typically handled by supervised classifiers, and evaluate their performance for potential use in digital humanities workflows.

Method: Benchmarking study using three Iconclass datasets (ArtDL, ICONCLASS, Wikidata) with top 10 classes. Tested CLIP, SigLIP, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 under three conditions: class labels only, Iconclass descriptions, and few-shot learning with 5 exemplars.

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on Wikidata dataset where SigLIP performed best. Class descriptions improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning generally produced lower results with minimal improvements.

Conclusion: General-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in complex cultural heritage domains, supporting their application as metadata curation tools in digital humanities. Future research should focus on prompt optimization and expanding to other classification strategies.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label
classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether
general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the
application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows,
suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the
study to other classification strategies and models.

*Ismael Elsharkawi,Hossam Sharara,Ahmed Rafea*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LRGC, a learnable graph construction method for Vision GNNs that uses attention and soft-threshold reparameterization to overcome limitations of non-learnable statistical methods in existing ViG models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ViG models use non-parameterized statistical methods for graph construction that may not select optimal neighborhoods and require hyper-parameter tuning. The authors aim to create a learnable, hyper-parameter-free graph construction method.

Method: LRGC applies key-query attention between all node pairs and uses soft-threshold reparameterization for differentiable edge selection. This allows learnable thresholds that adapt to training data rather than being fixed hyper-parameters.

Result: The proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: LRGC provides a more effective graph construction method for Vision GNNs by enabling learnable neighborhood selection and eliminating the need for hyper-parameter search in graph construction.

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point Prompt Defender is an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that automatically optimizes point prompts for SAM using an attack-for-defense paradigm to improve segmentation robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on heuristic or manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization in SAM's performance.

Method: Uses adversarial reinforcement learning with attacker and defender agents in a dual-space graph environment. Attacker degrades SAM performance while defender suppresses disruptive prompts. Both trained with Deep Q-Networks based on segmentation quality variation.

Result: Extensive experiments show effective improvement of SAM's robustness and generalization across diverse tasks without retraining.

Conclusion: Establishes a flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based segmentation that enhances SAM performance.

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or
manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this
paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks
without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender
effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a
flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based
segmentation.

Motivation: Existing remote sensing datasets lack comprehensive depth information or precise alignment between depth data and images, limiting the development of 3D vision models for geographic AI applications.

Method: The authors created RS3DBench with 54,951 pairs of remote sensing images and pixel-level aligned depth maps across diverse geographical contexts. They also developed a depth estimation model leveraging stable diffusion's multimodal fusion capabilities.

### [143] [DeblurSplat: SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting with Event Camera for Robust Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18898)
*Pengteng Li,Yunfan Lu,Pinhao Song,Weiyu Guo,Huizai Yao,F. Richard Yu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSplat is a novel method that combines event cameras with 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve motion deblurring without requiring Structure-from-Motion (SfM), using DUSt3R for direct point cloud initialization and event streams for fine-grained supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SfM-based methods suffer from cumulative errors in camera pose estimation that affect deblurring quality. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution for capturing dynamic changes, making them ideal for motion deblurring applications.

Method: 1) Uses DUSt3R to obtain initial point clouds directly from blurred images, bypassing SfM and camera pose errors. 2) Integrates event streams with blurred images to decode latent sharp images for supervision during 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization.

Result: DeblurSplat achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis with significant rendering efficiency improvements over state-of-the-art deblur 3D-GS methods across various scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed SfM-free approach successfully leverages event camera data and direct point cloud initialization to overcome limitations of traditional deblurring methods, demonstrating superior performance in both quality and efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

TL;DR: MoiréNet is a U-Net-based CNN framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain features to remove moiré patterns from digital images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moiré patterns from aliasing between display pixels and camera sensors create anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that are challenging to remove from digital images.

Method: Uses a Directional Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) to detect moiré orientation via directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector (FSAS) for feature-adaptive suppression.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets with only 5.513M parameters (48% reduction vs ESDNet-L), combining superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: MoiréNet is well-suited for resource-constrained applications like smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality due to its efficient performance.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices
and camera sensor grids, manifesting as anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that
pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically
integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact
removal. Moir\'eNet introduces two key components: a Directional

directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FAVS, a frequency-aware audio-visual segmentation framework that addresses frequency-domain contradictions between audio and visual modalities through frequency decomposition and synergistic cross-modal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AVS methods overlook inherent frequency-domain contradictions - audio high-frequency signals contain interfering noise while visual high-frequency signals contain structurally rich details, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: FAVS framework with two modules: Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) for residual-based iterative frequency decomposition, and Synergistic Cross-Modal Consistency (SCMC) using mixture-of-experts architecture for dynamic expert routing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets with extensive experiments and qualitative visualizations verifying effectiveness.

Conclusion: Reformulating AVS as frequency-domain decomposition and recomposition problem effectively addresses modality-specific frequency characteristics and improves segmentation performance.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding to generate high-quality synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous vehicle perception, improving performance on computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LiDAR data collection is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations, creating a need for high-quality synthetic data for augmentation.

Method: Enhanced DDPM with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate realistic point clouds, evaluated on IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets using four performance metrics against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance over most existing baselines, effectively mitigating effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data while producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail.

Conclusion: The enhanced diffusion model provides an effective solution for generating high-quality synthetic LiDAR data to improve autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

*Chuni Liu,Hongjie Li,Jiaqi Du,Yangyang Hou,Qian Sun,Lei Jin,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGSSP is a novel pretraining paradigm for metallic surface defect detection that uses anomaly priors to guide representation learning, addressing domain gaps from natural image pretraining and improving defect pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining approaches face challenges: ImageNet pretraining has domain gaps with industrial data, while self-supervised pretraining on industrial data fails to distinguish subtle defects from background noise.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) pretrain backbone by distilling knowledge from anomaly maps to capture defect-salient features, (2) pretrain detector using pseudo-defect boxes from anomaly maps. Uses knowledge-enhanced anomaly map generation and a 120,000-image industrial dataset.

Result: AGSSP consistently enhances performance across settings, achieving up to 10% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to ImageNet-based models.

Conclusion: AGSSP effectively bridges the domain gap and improves defect detection by explicitly guiding representation learning with anomaly priors, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly
available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First method for audio-driven universal photorealistic avatar synthesis using Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP) that captures both geometric and appearance variations from raw audio inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches only mapped audio to geometric deformations while ignoring appearance variations. This method aims to create realistic avatars with both accurate lip sync and nuanced expressive details.

Method: Combines person-agnostic speech model with UHAP trained on cross-identity multi-view videos. Uses monocular encoder for efficient personalization and fine-tuning. Maps raw audio directly to UHAP latent expression space encoding both geometry and appearance.

Result: Generates highly realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization, eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior appearance. Outperforms competing geometry-only methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: This is the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that accounts for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, achieving superior performance in lip-sync accuracy, image quality, and perceptual realism.

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning pipeline for automated detection, tracking, and analysis of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy data to study synaptic dynamics in learning and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale analysis of dendritic spine dynamics is challenging and labor-intensive, but crucial for understanding the neural basis of learning and memory since spine size correlates with synaptic efficacy.

Method: Modular pipeline combining transformer-based detection, depth-tracking with spatial features, time-tracking using spatial consistency, and feature extraction for biologically relevant spine properties.

Result: Validated on open-source and newly published annotated datasets (including first-of-its-kind time-tracking data), with code, data, and pre-trained weights released publicly.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable, end-to-end baseline for analyzing dendritic spine dynamics, facilitating future research in synaptic plasticity and neural connectivity.

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

### [151] [No Labels Needed: Zero-Shot Image Classification with Collaborative Self-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18938)
*Matheus Vinícius Todescato,Joel Luís Carbonera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot image classification framework combining vision-language models and pre-trained visual models in a self-learning cycle, requiring only class names without labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited annotated datasets in deep learning by leveraging VLMs and transfer learning for zero-shot classification without fine-tuning or large language models.

Method: Uses confidence-based pseudo-labeling with a VLM to identify high-confidence samples, enhanced by pre-trained visual models for feature representation, iteratively training a lightweight classifier on test data.

Result: Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets show the approach outperforms baseline zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines semantic and visual cues through self-learning, reducing dependence on semantic representation while achieving superior zero-shot classification performance.

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

*Zijing Guo,Yunyang Zhao,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MirrorScene3D dataset and ReflectiveGS method address 3D reconstruction challenges in mirror-rich environments by leveraging mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than treating them as artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS perform poorly in mirror-containing environments because they treat reflections as distortions rather than valuable information sources that can enhance scene understanding.

Method: Proposes ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints to improve scene geometry and recover missing details.

Result: Experiments show ReflectiveGS outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS metrics and training speed on the MirrorScene3D dataset.

Conclusion: The approach sets a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments by effectively leveraging mirror reflections as valuable information sources.

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

*Cristina Iacono,Mariarosaria Meola,Federica Conte,Laura Mecozzi,Umberto Bracale,Pietro Falco,Fanny Ficuciello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep-learning approach using Yolo detection algorithm and GAN-based data augmentation to localize the biliary tract from white-light surgical images during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, aiming to reduce bile duct injury risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, while having advantages like faster recovery, carries a higher risk of bile duct injury which significantly impacts quality of life and survival. Improving intraoperative visualization of the bile duct is essential to prevent such injuries.

Method: The researchers constructed and annotated an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm. They employed classical data augmentation techniques and proposed using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic portions of the training dataset for biliary tract localization.

Result: Experimental results were discussed in the paper, though specific performance metrics are not provided in the abstract. The approach focuses on localizing the biliary tract from white-light images acquired during surgical procedures.

Conclusion: The paper presents a deep-learning based solution for improving bile duct visualization during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, addressing the critical issue of bile duct injury through advanced computer vision techniques including GAN-based data augmentation.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical
considerations.

*Jiabao Chen,Shan Xiong,Jialin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt-DAS is a promptable multitask framework for domain adaptive segmentation of organelle instances from EM images, enabling flexible prompt usage for UDA, WDA, and interactive segmentation with improved efficiency over SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable annotation-efficient learning for domain adaptive segmentation of numerous organelle instances from large-scale electron microscopy by leveraging prompt-based approaches more efficiently than SAM.

Method: Proposes Prompt-DAS with auxiliary center-point detection task and prompt-guided contrastive learning, allowing flexible prompt usage (full points, sparse points, or no points) during training and testing.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show effectiveness over existing UDA, WDA, and SAM-based approaches.

Conclusion: Prompt-DAS provides a flexible and efficient framework for domain adaptive segmentation that outperforms existing methods while requiring less annotation effort.

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from
large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable
annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable
multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any
number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage.
Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fine-grained chain of step reasoning framework for vision-language models, enabling step-level quality assessment and effective reinforcement learning with fine-grained rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chain of thought reasoning in vision-language models operates at coarse-grained levels, struggling with fine-grained structured reasoning and lacking proper evaluation of intermediate reasoning quality.

Method: Proposes a simple, transparent framework including step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training for fine-grained reasoning assessment.

Result: The models achieve strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks, with thorough empirical analysis revealing component impacts and inference-time scaling properties.

Conclusion: This work establishes a baseline for vision-language models and provides insights into more complex multimodal reasoning, with all resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an
open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ
reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform
fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to
evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we
delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a
baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex
multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised semantic segmentation method for food images using ViT-generated CAMs as prompts for SAM, achieving mIoU of 0.54 on FoodSeg103 dataset without pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a food image segmentation approach that eliminates the need for expensive pixel-level annotations by leveraging zero-shot capabilities of SAM and attention mechanisms of ViTs.

Method: Uses class activation maps (CAMs) from Swin Transformer ViT (trained with image-level annotations) as prompts for Segment Anything Model (SAM), combined with image preprocessing and single/multi-mask generation strategies.

Result: Achieved mIoU of 0.54 on FoodSeg103 dataset with multi-mask scenario, generating average 2.4 masks per image (excluding background).

Conclusion: The approach can accelerate food image annotation and serve as a component in food/nutrition tracking applications, demonstrating effective weakly supervised segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach
for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and
promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention
mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation
maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable
for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained
exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food
and nutrition tracking applications.

*Jierui Qu,Jianchun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyL-UNet is a dynamic learning-based U-Net architecture that achieves temporally stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation by incorporating Echo-Dynamics Graph and Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention to reduce frame-to-frame jitter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography suffers from deformation and speckle noise causing temporal instability in segmentation, which weakens functional estimates and impairs clinical interpretability despite high single-frame accuracy.

Method: Proposes DyL-UNet with Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) for dynamic information extraction and Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at skip connections using Swin-Transformer-based encoder-decoder branches to enforce temporal consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets show DyL-UNet maintains comparable segmentation accuracy to existing methods while achieving superior temporal consistency.

Conclusion: DyL-UNet provides a reliable solution for automated clinical echocardiography by addressing temporal instability issues in cardiac anatomy segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

*Hung Nguyen,Runfa Li,An Le,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveletGaussian is an efficient framework for sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction that shifts diffusion to the wavelet domain, using diffusion only on low-resolution subbands and lightweight refinement for high-frequency components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior methods use diffusion models to repair corrupted renders but incur heavy computation from diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps.

Method: Shift diffusion into wavelet domain: apply diffusion only to low-resolution LL subband, refine high-frequency subbands with lightweight network. Use efficient online random masking strategy for training pairs instead of inefficient leave-one-out approach.

Result: Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D datasets show competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: WaveletGaussian provides an efficient alternative for sparse-view 3D Gaussian reconstruction by leveraging wavelet domain processing and optimized training strategies.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

TL;DR: Sa2VA-i is an improved version of Sa2VA that fixes training-inference inconsistencies, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple video segmentation benchmarks with significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Sa2VA model underperforms on referring video object segmentation tasks due to inconsistencies between training and inference procedures.

Method: Proposed Sa2VA-i which rectifies the identified inconsistencies in the original Sa2VA implementation while using the same model checkpoints.

Result: Sa2VA-i achieves improvements of +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS. The Sa2VA-i-1B model performs on par with the original Sa2VA-26B model on MeViS.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the importance of implementation details and provides valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field.

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and
video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation
benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA
does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object
segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference
procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and
improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple
video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA
checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the
original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will
show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it
will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method to enable generalist multimodal models (like Gemini2.5) to process multi-spectral imagery without retraining, achieving strong zero-shot performance on remote sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-spectral imagery is valuable for remote sensing but requires specialized ML models that are costly to train. Generalist multimodal models can't handle multi-spectral inputs despite their powerful capabilities.

Method: Adapts multi-spectral data to fit the visual space of RGB-trained models and injects domain-specific information as instructions, allowing zero-shot use without additional training.

Result: Achieves strong zero-shot performance gains on popular remote sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification using Gemini2.5.

Conclusion: Enables geospatial professionals to easily leverage powerful multimodal models with specialized sensor data, accelerating work while benefiting from rich reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe
strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing
benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy
adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential
for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to
easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate
their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,
grounded in the specialized sensor data.

Motivation: Traffic safety requires timely accident detection, and infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable solutions. The research aims to minimize reliance on extensive labeled datasets by leveraging MLLMs' zero-shot capabilities for automated accident detection.

Method: Used simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA to address data scarcity. Evaluated Gemini 1.5/2.0, Gemma 3, and Pixtral models without fine-tuning. Integrated YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for tracking, and SAM for segmentation into enhanced prompts to improve accuracy.

Result: Pixtral achieved best performance with F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall. Gemini models gained precision (Gemini 1.5 reached 90%) but suffered F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 showed most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate significant potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques for real-world automated traffic monitoring systems, enhancing applicability without extensive labeled data requirements.

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal

TL;DR: Track-On2 is a transformer-based model for online long-term point tracking that improves performance and efficiency through architectural refinements, better memory usage, and enhanced synthetic training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of long-term point tracking under significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion in real-time streaming applications, requiring consistent point identification across video frames.

Method: Extends prior Track-On model with causal transformer architecture, memory mechanism for temporal coherence, and systematic synthetic training. Uses coarse patch-level classification followed by refinement at inference, processing frames causally without future frame access.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong offline methods that use bidirectional context.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic data provide scalable solutions for real-world point tracking, highlighting effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

seas around Alaska, KAMERA provides up to an 80% reduction in dataset
processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware
synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All
collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced
later. All imagery and animal detections from a survey are mapped onto a world
plane for accurate surveyed area estimates and quick assessment of survey
results. We hope KAMERA will inspire other mapping and detection efforts in the
scientific community, with all software, models, and schematics fully

*Maurf Hassan,Steven Davy,Muhammad Zawish,Owais Bin Zuber,Nouman Ashraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuCODEX is a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that reduces data transmission and energy consumption for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by optimizing spatial and temporal redundancy through spike-driven compression and dynamic early-exit mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full SNN inference at the edge faces latency and energy constraints due to fixed timestep overheads, while existing edge-cloud co-inference systems suffer from high latency and feature transmission costs.

Method: NeuCODEX incorporates a learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on output confidence. It was prototyped on ResNet-18 and VGG-16 backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed.

Result: The system reduces data transfer by up to 2048x, edge energy consumption by over 90%, and end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, with a negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%.

Conclusion: NeuCODEX enables practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained environments by effectively addressing the challenges of edge-cloud co-inference systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

### [165] [RoSe: Robust Self-supervised Stereo Matching under Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19165)
*Yun Wang,Junjie Hu,Junhui Hou,Chenghao Zhang,Renwei Yang,Dapeng Oliver Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes RoSe, a robust self-supervised stereo matching method that addresses performance degradation under adverse weather conditions by injecting visual foundation model priors and using scene correspondence learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised stereo matching methods perform poorly under adverse weather conditions (night, rain, fog) due to CNN feature extractor struggles with degraded regions and disrupted pixel correspondences from photometric consistency assumptions.

Method: Inject robust priors from visual foundation models into CNN feature extractors; use scene correspondence priors with synthetic stereo datasets containing clear/adverse image pairs; implement two-step training: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse weather distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art self-supervised stereo matching methods under adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed RoSe framework effectively improves stereo matching robustness in adverse weather by leveraging foundation model priors and scene correspondence learning, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant
progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based polyp detection pipeline using M2IoU loss and data augmentations, achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorectal cancer screening with high precision and robustness across polyp sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual polyp detection during colonoscopy is inconsistent and prone to oversight, creating a need for more accurate and real-time AI-assisted diagnosis to improve colorectal cancer screening.

Method: Proposed YOLO-LAN pipeline trained with M2IoU loss, versatile data augmentations, and negative data to replicate real clinical situations, evaluated on Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp datasets.

Result: Achieved mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619 and mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12, and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540 and mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on Kvasir-seg dataset, outperforming existing methods with significant improvement in precision.

Conclusion: The pipeline demonstrates robust performance across polyp sizes and precise location detection, making it clinically relevant for AI-assisted colorectal cancer screening.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

Abstract: This technical report explores the MOSEv2 track of the LSVOS Challenge, which
targets complex semi-supervised video object segmentation. By analysing and
adapting SeC, an enhanced SAM-2 framework, we conduct a detailed study of its
long-term memory and concept-aware memory, showing that long-term memory
preserves temporal continuity under occlusion and reappearance, while
concept-aware memory supplies semantic priors that suppress distractors;
together, these traits directly benefit several MOSEv2's core challenges. Our
solution achieves a JF score of 39.89% on the test set, ranking 1st in the
MOSEv2 track of the LSVOS Challenge.

*Yueyan Li,Chenggong Zhao,Zeyuan Zang,Caixia Yuan,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes vision-language models (VLMs) by deconstructing visual processing into object recognition and spatial perception pathways, revealing a two-stage object recognition process and geometric structure in spatial perception, then proposes efficiency improvements based on these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs process images serially, which diverges from human parallel vision, and their opaque internal mechanisms hinder understanding and innovation. The paper aims to provide deeper insights into VLM internals by drawing inspiration from the dual-stream hypothesis of human vision.

Method: The authors deconstruct VLM visual processing into object recognition (converting images to text token maps) and spatial perception (theoretical derivation of geometric structure). They analyze the two-stage object recognition process and empirically verify spatial perception mechanisms.

Result: The study reveals that object recognition unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers (attribute recognition to semantic disambiguation), and identifies the geometric structure underlying positional representation in VLMs. Based on these findings, they develop a token compression algorithm and RoPE scaling technique.

Conclusion: The work validates the dual-stream analysis approach, offers deeper understanding of VLM internals, and provides clear design principles for more capable future architectures through rigorous experiments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

### [169] [Vision-Free Retrieval: Rethinking Multimodal Search with Textual Scene Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19203)
*Ioanna Ntinou,Alexandros Xenos,Yassine Ouali,Adrian Bulat,Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a vision-free, single-encoder retrieval pipeline that replaces traditional text-to-image retrieval with text-to-text retrieval using VLLM-generated structured image descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved compositionality and privacy benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of contrastively-trained VLMs like CLIP, which exhibit shallow language understanding, modality gap issues, computational expense, and privacy concerns from web-collected training data.

Method: Migrate from text-to-image to text-to-text retrieval paradigm using VLLM-generated structured image descriptions, requiring only a few hours of calibration on two GPUs.

Result: Vision-free retriever matches/surpasses traditional multimodal models, achieves SOTA zero-shot performance on retrieval and compositionality benchmarks with models as small as 0.3B parameters, reduces modality gap, improves compositionality.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-free approach demonstrates that vision encoders may not be necessary for retrieval tasks, offering a more efficient, privacy-friendly alternative with superior performance characteristics.

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

*Israfel Salazar,Desmond Elliott,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training for compositionality improves long-caption understanding, and vice versa, but gains depend on data quality and model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding long, dense captions remains challenging for VLMs, and compositionality may be key to this capability.

Method: Train and evaluate models targeting compositionality and long-caption understanding, testing bidirectional relationship and sensitivity to data quality/model design.

Result: Bidirectional relationship confirmed: compositional training improves long-caption retrieval, and long-caption training promotes compositionality. Gains are sensitive to data quality and model parameters.

Conclusion: Compositional understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that can be jointly learned through high-quality dense descriptions.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

TL;DR: A framework using synthetic RGB imagery, limited real annotations, and GAN-based cross-modality alignment to improve plant segmentation in thermal images for field phenotyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery is challenging due to low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent occlusions in outdoor environments.

Method: Trained models on 1,128 synthetic images with crop/weed mixtures, integrated 5 real segmented field images using various sampling strategies, and used CycleGAN-turbo for RGB-to-thermal translation to enable cross-modal alignment.

Result: Maximum relative improvement of 22% for weed class and 17% for plant class compared to full real-data baseline when combining synthetic data with limited real annotations.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related
research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets,
particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we
present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with

total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The
proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging

Motivation: To overcome challenges in modeling occluded traffic participant interactions and capturing complex asynchronous multi-temporal behavioral cues preceding accidents in dashcam videos for proactive safety interventions.

Method: Three-layer architecture: 1) Multi-scale Module for short/mid/long-term scene representations, 2) Transformer for feature interactions, 3) Temporal processing under causal constraints, 4) Multi-scale post fusion of scene and object features.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-scale models on DAD and DADA datasets in both prediction correctness and earliness, with ablation studies validating each module's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MsFIN demonstrates superior accident anticipation through multi-scale feature fusion and contextual interaction modeling, providing an effective solution for dashcam-based proactive safety systems.

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a continual learning approach for face forgery detection using a Developmental Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with LoRA models to adapt to evolving forgery techniques while preventing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of digital face generation and manipulation techniques outpaces existing detection models, requiring a system that can quickly adapt to new forgery types with limited data while retaining knowledge of previous types.

Method: Uses a Developmental Mixture of Experts architecture with LoRA models organized into Real-LoRA (for real faces) and multiple Fake-LoRAs (for different forgery types). Employs orthogonal gradients and orthogonal loss to prevent catastrophic forgetting and gradient interference.

Result: Experimental results show effectiveness under both datasets and manipulation types incremental protocols, demonstrating the model's ability to adapt to new forgery types while maintaining performance on previously learned types.

Conclusion: The proposed continual learning framework successfully addresses the challenge of evolving face forgery techniques by enabling incremental learning while preventing forgetting, making it practical for real-world deployment against rapidly advancing manipulation methods.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

*Benedetta Liberatori,Alessandro Conti,Lorenzo Vaquero,Yiming Wang,Elisa Ricci,Paolo Rota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConViS introduces concept-based video similarity estimation using natural language to compare videos across predefined semantic concepts, enabling human-like reasoning about video similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video similarity models rely on broad global scores and lack the ability to compare videos based on specific semantic aspects like humans do, which limits their interpretability and application potential.

Method: Proposed Concept-based Video Similarity (ConViS) task that computes interpretable similarity scores across key semantic concepts using Large Multimodal Models. Created ConViS-Bench benchmark with annotated video pairs and concept-level similarity scores.

Result: Benchmarking revealed significant performance differences among state-of-the-art models, showing that some concepts are more challenging for video similarity estimation than others.

Conclusion: ConViS-Bench provides a valuable resource for advancing language-driven video understanding research by enabling more nuanced, concept-based video comparisons that align better with human reasoning.

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

### [178] [Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) Descriptor to Characterize Imaging Heterogeneity in Confounding Tumor Pathologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19258)
*Dheerendranath Battalapalli,Apoorva Safai,Maria Jaramillo,Hyemin Um,Gustavo Adalfo Pineda Ortiz,Ulas Bagci,Manmeet Singh Ahluwalia,Marwa Ismail,Pallavi Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GrRAiL is a graph-based radiomic learning method that captures intralesional heterogeneity on MRI by analyzing spatial relationships among sub-region clusters, outperforming existing methods in differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects and stratifying pancreatic neoplasms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiomics methods aggregate features across lesion regions and miss complex spatial relationships, limiting their ability to distinguish confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging.

Method: GrRAiL identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters, creating weighted graphs that encode higher-order spatial relationships within lesions.

Result: In multi-institutional evaluations across three use cases (glioblastoma, brain metastasis, pancreatic IPMNs), GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines with test accuracies of 78% (GBM), 74% (brain metastasis), and 75% (IPMN risk stratification), showing >10% improvements over comparators.

Conclusion: GrRAiL effectively captures intralesional heterogeneity and reliably disambiguates confounding pathologies from malignancy, demonstrating clinical feasibility and superior performance over existing radiomics and graph-based methods.

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing
confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While
radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI,
many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

*Markos Diomataris,Berat Mert Albaba,Giorgio Becherini,Partha Ghosh,Omid Taheri,Michael J. Black*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLOPS is the first human avatar system that uses egocentric vision as the primary perception mechanism to generate human-like motion, overcoming dataset limitations through decoupled learning of motion skills and visual control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human motion generation methods use task-specific perception that differs from human perception. The authors argue that generating human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception, specifically egocentric vision.

Method: The approach decouples learning: first training a motion prior model on large motion capture data, then training a policy using Q-learning to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion prior.

Result: Experiments show that egocentric vision produces human-like motion characteristics, such as obstacle avoidance based on visual field input.

Conclusion: Equipping avatars with human-like sensors like egocentric vision is promising for training avatars that behave like humans.

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses layout-to-image generation challenges with overlapping bounding boxes, introducing OverLayScore metric and OverLayBench benchmark to evaluate model performance on complex overlaps, and proposes CreatiLayout-AM as an improved solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout-to-image generation methods struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes, particularly with large overlapping regions and instances with minimal semantic distinction, which degrades generation quality.

Method: The authors introduce OverLayScore to quantify overlap complexity, create OverLayBench benchmark with balanced distribution across overlap levels, and propose CreatiLayout-AM model fine-tuned on curated amodal mask dataset.

Result: Analysis shows existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under challenging overlap conditions.

Conclusion: The contributions provide groundwork for more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging scenarios with complex bounding box overlaps.

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-distillation framework that distills 3D knowledge from video diffusion models into 3D Gaussian Splatting representation for generating virtual environments without requiring multi-view training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods need real-world multi-view data, which is often unavailable. Video diffusion models have strong imagination capabilities but are limited to 2D, while applications like robotics and autonomous driving require 3D environments for navigation and interaction.

Method: Proposes a self-distillation framework with a 3DGS decoder supervised by the RGB decoder output. The 3DGS decoder is trained purely on synthetic data from video diffusion models. Supports text prompts or single images for static scenes, and monocular videos for dynamic scenes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and dynamic 3D scene generation, enabling real-time rendering from text or image inputs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges 2D video diffusion models with explicit 3D representations, eliminating the need for multi-view training data while maintaining high-quality 3D scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolSplat introduces a voxel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm to overcome limitations of pixel-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis with improved multi-view consistency and geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from view dependency, biased density distributions, and alignment errors due to reliance on 2D feature matching, especially with occlusions or low-texture inputs.

Method: VolSplat replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians by directly predicting Gaussians from a 3D voxel grid, enabling adaptive density control based on 3D scene complexity and robust multi-view consistency.

Result: Experiments on RealEstate10K and ScanNet show VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance with more plausible Gaussian reconstructions, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality.

Conclusion: VolSplat establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser, more robust representations, paving the way for broader research applications.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAR-Flow is a lightweight method that conditions source/target distributions in flow matching to shorten probability paths, improving training efficiency and performance with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based methods require models to learn both mass transport and conditional injection, which is demanding. The authors aim to ease this burden by conditioning the distributions directly.

Method: Proposes Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) - a learned shift that conditions source, target, or both distributions to shorten the probability path the model must learn.

Result: On ImageNet-256, CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68 when equipped to SiT-XL/2, while adding less than 0.6% parameters. Also validated on synthetic data.

Conclusion: CAR-Flow effectively improves flow matching performance by simplifying the learning task through distribution conditioning, achieving better results with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

*Seungyoun Shin,Dongha Ahn,Jiwoo Kim,Sungwook Jeon*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes an iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method that uses human-labeled preference pairs to optimize prosodic naturalness in text-to-speech systems, addressing the limitations of GRPO which collapses prosody into monotone speech despite improving transcription accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO trained on transcription-oriented signals (CER/NLL) lowers error rates but collapses prosody into monotone, unnatural speech. Adding speaker-similarity further destabilizes training and degrades CER. There's a need for methods that can optimize prosodic naturalness when automatic rewards for prosody are unavailable.

Method: An iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) scheme that uses only a few hundred human-labeled preference pairs per round to directly optimize prosodic naturalness while regularizing to the current model. Tested on KoCC-TTS, a curated dataset of authentic Korean call center interactions.

Result: The method attains the highest human preference (ELO) with competitive CER, outperforming GRPO and strong commercial baselines on the Korean call center dataset.

Conclusion: When prosody cannot be rewarded automatically, human preference optimization offers a practical and data-efficient path to natural and robust TTS.

Abstract: Recent work reports gains in neural text-to-speech (TTS) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, in the absence of a verifiable reward for
\textit{prosody}, GRPO trained on transcription-oriented signals (CER/NLL)
lowers error rates yet collapses prosody into monotone, unnatural speech;
adding speaker-similarity further destabilizes training and degrades CER. We
address this with an \textit{iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)}
scheme that uses only a few hundred human-labeled preference pairs per round to
directly optimize prosodic naturalness while regularizing to the current model.
On \textbf{KoCC-TTS}, a curated dataset of authentic Korean call center
interactions capturing task-oriented dialogues, our method attains the highest
human preference (ELO) with competitive CER, outperforming GRPO and strong
commercial baselines. These results suggest that when prosody cannot be
rewarded automatically, \textit{human preference optimization} offers a
practical and data-efficient path to natural and robust TTS. The demo page is

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: HarmoniFuse is a component-selective and prompt-adaptive framework for multi-task speech language modeling that addresses task interference between ASR and SER by selectively fusing task-relevant speech components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multitask speech language models risk task interference and performance degradation because they don't explicitly model the different information requirements of tasks like ASR (linguistic content) and SER (linguistic + paralinguistic cues).

Method: HarmoniFuse uses a gated speech encoder for task-specific acoustic features, a prompt-adaptive dynamic fusion module to aggregate transformer layers based on task characteristics, and batch-interleaved training to leverage separate datasets without joint annotation.

Result: Experimental results show HarmoniFuse improves both ASR and SER performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: HarmoniFuse provides a scalable and robust solution for multitask speech understanding under realistic data constraints by harmonizing heterogeneous task demands.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have facilitated the development of
unified speech language models (SLMs) capable of supporting multiple speech
tasks within a shared architecture. However, tasks such as automatic speech
recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) rely on distinct types
of information: ASR primarily depends on linguistic content, whereas SER
requires the integration of both linguistic and paralinguistic cues. Existing
multitask SLMs typically adopt naive parameter sharing or prompt-based
conditioning without explicitly modeling the differences in information
composition required by each task. Such designs risk task interference and
performance degradation, especially under limited data conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose HarmoniFuse, a component-selective and
prompt-adaptive framework for multi-task speech language modeling. HarmoniFuse
is designed to harmonize heterogeneous task demands by selecting and fusing
task-relevant components of speech representations. Specifically, it integrates
a gated speech encoder to extract task-specific acoustic features and a
prompt-adaptive dynamic fusion module to aggregate transformer layers based on
task characteristics. In addition, a batch-interleaved training strategy
enables leveraging separate ASR and SER datasets without requiring joint
annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that HarmoniFuse improves both ASR
and SER performance, offering a scalable and robust solution for multitask
speech understanding under realistic data constraints.

TL;DR: A unified knowledge distillation framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from textual teacher models to audio student models using source-wise and layer-wise distillation to bridge the modality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large audio language models struggle with complex reasoning due to the modality gap between audio and text and lack of structured intermediate supervision.

Method: Proposes dual-dimensional distillation: source-wise (textual and acoustic teachers provide modality-specific supervision) and layer-wise (aligns teacher signals with appropriate student layers for efficient transfer).

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in audio reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and speech representations, serving as an effective reasoning transfer solution for audio modeling.

Abstract: While large audio language models excel at tasks like ASR and emotion
recognition, they still struggle with complex reasoning due to the modality gap
between audio and text as well as the lack of structured intermediate
supervision. To address this, we propose a unified knowledge distillation
framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a high-capacity textual
teacher model to a student audio models while preserving its acoustic
competence. Our method introduces two key dimensions: source-wise distillation,
which leverages both textual and acoustic teachers to provide complementary
modality-specific supervision; and layer-wise distillation, which aligns
teacher signals with appropriate student layers to improve transfer efficiency.
This dual-dimensional strategy enables fine-grained control over the
distillation process, effectively bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning
and speech representations. Experimental results show significant improvements
in audio reasoning performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
framework as a reasoning transfer solution for audio modeling.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A neural network approach using ConvNeXt architecture is developed to estimate strongly correlated parameters in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation from single-shot field images, achieving high accuracy with 3.22% mean absolute error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter estimation for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation is challenging due to strong parameter correlations, and existing methods struggle with accurate estimation from single measurements.

Method: Combines fast numerical solver with ConvNeXt neural network architecture using multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss, trained on 100,000 simulated images to estimate nonlinear coefficient, saturation intensity, and absorption coefficient.

Result: Achieves 3.22% mean absolute error on 12,500 test samples, demonstrating strong generalization and close agreement with ground-truth values.

Conclusion: Provides efficient characterization of nonlinear systems and bridges theoretical modeling with experimental data when realistic noise is incorporated.

Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model for wave
dynamics in nonlinear media ranging from optical fibers to Bose-Einstein
condensates. Accurately estimating its parameters, which are often strongly
correlated, from a single measurement remains a significant challenge. We
address this problem by treating parameter estimation as an inverse problem and
training a neural network to invert the NLSE mapping. We combine a fast
numerical solver with a machine learning approach based on the ConvNeXt
architecture and a multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss function.
From single-shot field (density and phase) images, our model estimates three
key parameters: the nonlinear coefficient $n_2$, the saturation intensity
$I_{sat}$, and the linear absorption coefficient $\alpha$. Trained on 100,000
simulated images, the model achieves a mean absolute error of $3.22\%$ on
12,500 unseen test samples, demonstrating strong generalization and close
agreement with ground-truth values. This approach provides an efficient route
for characterizing nonlinear systems and has the potential to bridge
theoretical modeling and experimental data when realistic noise is
incorporated.

TL;DR: This paper explores using quantum computing to synthetically generate skyrmion textures, which are topologically protected spin patterns that can function as quantum bits (qubits) due to their quantized helicity states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin patterns that can serve as quantum bits due to their quantized helicity states. The paper investigates whether quantum computing can be used to synthetically generate these skyrmion textures, potentially opening new research directions based on quantum randomness.

Method: The researchers used quantum computing approaches to generate synthetic skyrmion textures, producing several hundred different texture samples for comparison across various types.

Result: The study successfully generated a few hundred different skyrmion textures using quantum computing methods, with sample comparisons indicating promising results across various texture types.

Conclusion: Quantum computing shows potential for synthetically generating skyrmion textures, providing a novel direction for skyrmion-based research that leverages quantum randomness and other quantum computing criteria.

Abstract: An integer winding, i.e., topological charge, is a characteristic of
skyrmions, which are topologically nontrivial spin patterns in magnets. They
emerge when smooth two-dimensional spin configurations are stabilized by
conflicting interactions such as exchange, anisotropy, the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, or geometric frustration. These nanoscale
textures, which are typically a few to tens of nanometers in size, are strong
'particle-like' excitations because they are shielded by energy barriers
connected to their topology. By exploiting their helicity, i.e., spin rotation
angle or associated internal modes, as a two-level system, skyrmions can
function as quantum bits or qubits. Two quantized helicity states of a
nanometer-scale skyrmion encode the logical value states in a 'skyrmion qubit.'
Interestingly, skyrmion qubits are topologically protected and macroscopic,
i.e., they involve a large number of spins; however, external influences can
still affect them. When the texture is tiny and disconnected, the helicity
angle of the skyrmion becomes quantized. A qubit basis is made up of the lowest
two energy eigenstates, i.e., symmetric or antisymmetric superpositions of
opposite helicity, for example. Therefore, Skyrmion textures can provide
valuable insights for different purposes. However, is it possible to
synthetically generate skyrmion textures using quantum computing? This paper
investigates the possibility and generates a few hundred different textures,
producing sample comparisons from various types, which indicate a novel
direction for skyrmion-based research based on quantum randomness and other
criteria.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A semantic particle filter for vineyard robot localization that fuses LiDAR with semantic object detections (vine trunks, poles) and uses semantic walls to overcome perceptual aliasing in repetitive row structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based localization fails in vineyards due to repetitive row geometry causing perceptual aliasing. Existing methods struggle with the structured but visually similar environment.

Method: Semantic particle filter incorporating object-level detections projected to bird's-eye view, semantic walls connecting landmarks as pseudo-structural constraints, and adaptive GPS prior for headland regions with sparse semantics.

Result: Maintains localization within correct rows, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails, and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods like RTAB-Map in real vineyard experiments.

Conclusion: The semantic approach effectively addresses perceptual aliasing in structured agricultural environments, providing robust localization where traditional LiDAR and vision methods struggle.

Abstract: Accurate localisation is critical for mobile robots in structured outdoor
environments, yet LiDAR-based methods often fail in vineyards due to repetitive
row geometry and perceptual aliasing. We propose a semantic particle filter
that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and
support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are
projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic
observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect
adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row
aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics
are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter.
Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains
localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails,
and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.

Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models require large-scale manually labeled action datasets and have large model sizes that make real-world deployment challenging. LAWM aims to enable unsupervised pretraining on unlabeled data for better efficiency and practicality.

Method: The framework learns latent action representations from unlabeled video data (robot recordings or human action videos) through world modeling in a self-supervised way, making it transferable across tasks, environments, and embodiments.

Result: LAWM outperforms models trained with ground-truth robotics actions and similar pretraining methods on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world setup, while being significantly more efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical and efficient approach for pretraining imitation learning models that works effectively across different scenarios and is suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have gained popularity for learning
robotic manipulation tasks that follow language instructions. State-of-the-art
VLAs, such as OpenVLA and $\pi_{0}$, were trained on large-scale, manually
labeled action datasets collected through teleoperation. More recent
approaches, including LAPA and villa-X, introduce latent action representations
that enable unsupervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets by modeling abstract
visual changes between frames. Although these methods have shown strong
results, their large model sizes make deployment in real-world settings
challenging. In this work, we propose LAWM, a model-agnostic framework to
pretrain imitation learning models in a self-supervised way, by learning latent
action representations from unlabeled video data through world modeling. These
videos can be sourced from robot recordings or videos of humans performing
actions with everyday objects. Our framework is designed to be effective for
transferring across tasks, environments, and embodiments. It outperforms models
trained with ground-truth robotics actions and similar pretraining methods on
the LIBERO benchmark and real-world setup, while being significantly more
efficient and practical for real-world settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLN-Zero is a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that uses vision-language models to create symbolic scene graphs for zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation, achieving better performance with fewer computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing approaches that rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid navigation policies that fail to generalize in unseen environments, enabling rapid adaptation and scalable real-world autonomy.

Method: A two-phase framework: exploration phase uses structured prompts to guide VLM-based search for diverse trajectories to build compact scene graphs; deployment phase uses neurosymbolic planner to reason over scene graphs and environmental observations, with cache-enabled execution for accelerated adaptation.

Result: Achieves 2x higher success rate than state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, reaches goals in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average across diverse environments.

Conclusion: VLN-Zero combines rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution to overcome computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments.

Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world
autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid
navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase
vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to
efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic
navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search
toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph
representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over
the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans,
while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing
previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration,
symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework
overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior
vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable
decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success
rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned
baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls
on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments.

TL;DR: GP-CA is a novel approach for point cloud registration that quantifies and explains uncertainty, outperforming traditional methods like ICP by attributing uncertainty to specific error sources and using active learning for improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional point cloud registration methods like ICP fail under uncertainty from sensor noise, pose-estimation errors, and partial overlap due to occlusion.

Method: Gaussian Process Concept Attribution (GP-CA) quantifies registration uncertainty and explains it by attributing uncertainty to known error sources, leveraging active learning to discover new uncertainty sources by querying informative instances.

Result: GP-CA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in runtime, sample-efficiency with active learning, and accuracy. Validated on three public datasets and real-world robot experiments, it enables effective failure-recovery behaviors for robust robotic perception.

Conclusion: GP-CA provides a comprehensive solution for robust point cloud registration with uncertainty quantification and explanation, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world robotic scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the point cloud registration problem, where
well-known methods like ICP fail under uncertainty arising from sensor noise,
pose-estimation errors, and partial overlap due to occlusion. We develop a
novel approach, Gaussian Process Concept Attribution (GP-CA), which not only
quantifies registration uncertainty but also explains it by attributing
uncertainty to well-known sources of errors in registration problems. Our
approach leverages active learning to discover new uncertainty sources in the
wild by querying informative instances. We validate GP-CA on three publicly
available datasets and in our real-world robot experiment. Extensive ablations
substantiate our design choices. Our approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime, high sample-efficiency with
active learning, and high accuracy. Our real-world experiment clearly
demonstrates its applicability. Our video also demonstrates that GP-CA enables
effective failure-recovery behaviors, yielding more robust robotic perception.

TL;DR: DexSkin is a soft capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive tactile sensing for robotic manipulation, allowing robots to learn contact-rich tasks through learning-from-demonstration and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replicating human skin's rich tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge, particularly for localizing contact events over large contoured surfaces.

Method: Developed DexSkin - a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that provides sensitive, localized tactile sensing coverage across entire finger surfaces. Demonstrated efficacy by sensorizing parallel jaw gripper fingers and evaluating in learning-from-demonstration framework for challenging manipulation tasks.

Result: DexSkin enables learning of challenging manipulation tasks requiring full-finger sensing coverage, such as object reorientation and elastic band wrapping. The system supports model transfer across sensor instances through calibration and is applicable to online reinforcement learning on real robots.

Conclusion: DexSkin demonstrates suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation tasks, providing a step toward replicating human tactile sensing capabilities in robotic systems.

Abstract: Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional and
unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating
these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems
remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this
goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive
electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile
sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy
for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel
jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger
surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning
challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire
surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping
elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then
show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to
enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its
applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results
highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world,
contact-rich manipulation. Please see our project webpage for videos and

*Minoo Dolatabadi,Fardin Ayar,Ehsan Javanmardi,Manabu Tsukada,Mahdi Javanmardi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for predicting ICP registration error covariance before matching, enabling better integration with Kalman filtering for improved LiDAR localization accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICP-based localization struggles with featureless environments and dynamic scenes, and existing uncertainty estimation methods either require pre-built maps or provide inadequate binary classifications.

Method: Data-driven deep learning approach that estimates 6-DoF error covariance for ICP registration without needing a reference map, allowing seamless Kalman filter integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI dataset show accurate covariance prediction and reduced localization errors in both map-based localization and SLAM applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively predicts ICP uncertainty, enhances localization robustness, and improves overall system performance without requiring pre-built maps.

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching
algorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align
sensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to
errors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate
pose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is
crucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing
approaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions.
Moreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation
either depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide
a binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to
properly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework
that leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of
ICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating
each LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method
enables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing
localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
accurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a
pre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A fast local solver for object shape and pose estimation using category-level priors with efficient global optimality certification


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object shape and pose estimation is foundational for robotics tasks like manipulation, scene understanding, and navigation, requiring efficient and reliable solutions

Method: Uses learned front-end to detect sparse semantic keypoints from RGB-D images, represents shape with linear active shape model, and solves MAP optimization problem using self-consistent field iteration with eigenvalue problems

Result: Solver runs extremely fast (100 microseconds per iteration), enables quick outlier rejection, and provides global optimality certificate through Lagrange multipliers

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic data, real-world datasets, and drone tracking scenarios, offering a practical solution for robotics applications

Abstract: Object shape and pose estimation is a foundational robotics problem,
supporting tasks from manipulation to scene understanding and navigation. We
present a fast local solver for shape and pose estimation which requires only
category-level object priors and admits an efficient certificate of global
optimality. Given an RGB-D image of an object, we use a learned front-end to
detect sparse, category-level semantic keypoints on the target object. We
represent the target object's unknown shape using a linear active shape model
and pose a maximum a posteriori optimization problem to solve for position,
orientation, and shape simultaneously. Expressed in unit quaternions, this
problem admits first-order optimality conditions in the form of an eigenvalue
problem with eigenvector nonlinearities. Our primary contribution is to solve
this problem efficiently with self-consistent field iteration, which only
requires computing a 4-by-4 matrix and finding its minimum eigenvalue-vector
pair at each iterate. Solving a linear system for the corresponding Lagrange
multipliers gives a simple global optimality certificate. One iteration of our
solver runs in about 100 microseconds, enabling fast outlier rejection. We test
our method on synthetic data and a variety of real-world settings, including
two public datasets and a drone tracking scenario. Code is released at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FunCanon framework converts long-horizon manipulation tasks into action chunks (actor-verb-object) for compositional policy learning, using functional object canonicalization and diffusion policies to achieve category-level generalization and sim2real deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end demonstrations often produce task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond training distribution, limiting scalability in complex manipulation domains.

Method: Functional object canonicalization maps objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from vision language models, combined with object-centric and action-centric diffusion policy (FuncDiffuser) trained on aligned data.

Result: Experiments show category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment across simulated and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Functional canonicalization provides strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning, enabling policies to respect object affordances and poses while improving generalization ability.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to
task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training
distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts
long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined
by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the
actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and
reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional
object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation
trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using
affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action
centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally
respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving
generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and
robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a
strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation
domains. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper explores zero-shot deepfake detection and prevention methods to address evolving threats from advanced generative models like GANs and diffusion models, proposing an integrated defense framework combining detection and prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology through GANs and diffusion models poses significant threats to digital security, media integrity, and public trust, requiring innovative detection approaches that can handle unseen deepfake variations.

Method: The research investigates self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifiers, generative model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques for detection, along with AI-driven prevention strategies including adversarial perturbations, digital watermarking, real-time AI monitoring, and blockchain-based verification.

Result: The study identifies that while zero-shot detection and prevention show promise, they face critical challenges including adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: An integrated defense framework combining zero-shot learning with preventive mechanisms is needed, along with interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against deepfake attacks.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

### [198] [Differentiable Light Transport with Gaussian Surfels via Adapted Radiosity for Efficient Relighting and Geometry Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18497)
*Kaiwen Jiang,Jia-Mu Sun,Zilu Li,Dan Wang,Tzu-Mao Li,Ravi Ramamoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient framework for differentiable light transport using Gaussian surfels, enabling global illumination effects for radiance fields while maintaining high performance and accurate geometry reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiance fields sacrifice material reflective properties and lighting modeling, leading to geometric ambiguities and inability to perform relighting. Existing physically-based rendering approaches are too expensive for global illumination in optimization loops.

Method: Uses Gaussian surfels as primitives with spherical harmonics representation, extends classic radiosity theory to non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives, proposes novel solvers for light transport, and derives efficient backward pass for gradient optimization.

Result: Achieves view-independent rendering with hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent reflections. Demonstrates superior geometry reconstruction, view synthesis, and relighting compared to previous inverse rendering and data-driven baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of current radiance fields by enabling efficient global illumination while maintaining high performance, providing better geometry reconstruction and relighting capabilities even with sparse datasets.

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Text Slider is a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that enables continuous control of visual concepts in diffusion models by identifying low-rank directions in pre-trained text encoders, achieving 5x faster training and significant memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept control methods for diffusion models require intensive training time, GPU memory, and retraining for different backbones, limiting scalability and adaptability.

Method: Identifies low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder to enable continuous control of visual concepts without retraining the entire model. Supports multi-concept composition and continuous control.

Result: Achieves 5x faster training than Concept Slider and 47x faster than Attribute Control, while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2x and 4x respectively. Enables smooth modulation of attributes while preserving spatial layout.

Conclusion: Text Slider provides an efficient, plug-and-play solution for fine-grained concept control in diffusion models, significantly improving training efficiency and resource usage while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel contrastive learning framework for fine-grained visual feature transfer, particularly for embroidery customization, using diffusion models and two-stage LoRA modulation to disentangle style and content features from a single reference image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style transfer methods struggle with fine-grained features like embroidery, which involves intricate stitch patterns and material properties. There's a need for better customization capabilities beyond basic artistic style transfer.

Method: Proposes a contrastive learning framework that: 1) Uses image pairs to define target style, 2) Adopts similarity metrics from pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation, 3) Implements two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation (iterative whole LoRA updates + contrastive learning with self-knowledge distillation), 4) Builds inference pipeline for image/text inputs using only style blocks.

Result: The method surpasses prior approaches on embroidery customization benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and appearance transfer across three additional domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles fine-grained style transfer challenges like embroidery, providing a robust solution for complex visual feature customization with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.

TL;DR: SBIND is a deep learning framework that models spatiotemporal dependencies in neural imaging data to disentangle behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for modeling neural dynamics in high-dimensional imaging data often discard behaviorally relevant information through preprocessing and miss complex spatiotemporal structure.

Method: A data-driven deep learning framework that identifies both local and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while separating behaviorally relevant neural dynamics from irrelevant ones.

Result: SBIND outperforms existing models in neural-behavioral prediction and effectively identifies spatial dependencies while dissociating behaviorally relevant dynamics.

Conclusion: SBIND provides a versatile tool for investigating neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging modalities like widefield calcium imaging and functional ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and
functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for
understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately
modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this
relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal
dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these
modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to
obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However,
this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss
spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning
framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle
their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate
SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional
ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely
remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local
and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating
behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing
models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile
tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: Medical AI benchmarks are misleading - high scores don't reflect real medical understanding. Models show brittleness, shortcut learning, and fabricate reasoning despite achieving top benchmark scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose how current medical benchmarks reward test-taking tricks rather than genuine medical understanding, and to demonstrate that leaderboard scores don't reflect real-world readiness for healthcare applications.

Method: Evaluated six flagship models across six widely used medical benchmarks using stress tests including removing key inputs, testing prompt sensitivity, and analyzing reasoning quality through clinician-guided rubric evaluation.

Result: Leading systems guess correctly even without key inputs, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, fabricate convincing but flawed reasoning, and benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure but are treated interchangeably.

Conclusion: Medical benchmark scores don't directly reflect real-world readiness. To earn trust in healthcare, AI systems must be held accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands beyond just leaderboard wins.

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical
benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often
guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers
under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning.
These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking
tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six
widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness
and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that
benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated
interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark
scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn
trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold
systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real
medical demands.

*Saeed Almheiri,Rania Hossam,Mena Attia,Chenxi Wang,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning is possible using lightweight alignment methods, showing that just 12 culture-specific examples from one Arab country can improve performance in others by 10% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. The potential for cross-cultural transfer using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others remains underexplored.

Method: Used a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, evaluating lightweight alignment methods like in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

Result: 12 culture-specific examples from one country improved performance in others by 10% on average within multilingual models. Out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts matched or surpassed in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning.

Conclusion: Efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offers a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings, demonstrating cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting
their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has
explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using
alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains
underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense
reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities
coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded
commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate
lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and
demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised
fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12
culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by
10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that
out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or
surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural
commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate
that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising
approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

Conclusion: Multi-agent architectures represent a meaningful advancement for automated literature survey generation in rapidly evolving scientific domains, demonstrating superior synthesis quality and scalability.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature poses unprecedented
challenges for researchers attempting to synthesize knowledge across rapidly
evolving fields. We present \textbf{Agentic AutoSurvey}, a multi-agent
framework for automated survey generation that addresses fundamental
limitations in existing approaches. Our system employs four specialized agents
(Paper Search Specialist, Topic Mining \& Clustering, Academic Survey Writer,
and Quality Evaluator) working in concert to generate comprehensive literature
surveys with superior synthesis quality. Through experiments on six
representative LLM research topics from COLM 2024 categories, we demonstrate
that our multi-agent approach achieves significant improvements over existing
baselines, scoring 8.18/10 compared to AutoSurvey's 4.77/10. The multi-agent
architecture processes 75--443 papers per topic (847 total across six topics)
while targeting high citation coverage (often $\geq$80\% on 75--100-paper sets;
lower on very large sets such as RLHF) through specialized agent orchestration.
Our 12-dimension evaluation captures organization, synthesis integration, and
critical analysis beyond basic metrics. These findings demonstrate that
multi-agent architectures represent a meaningful advancement for automated
literature survey generation in rapidly evolving scientific domains.

*Maryam Viqar,Erdem Sahin,Elena Stoykova,Violeta Madjarova*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Deep learning approach for reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images directly from wavelength domain, eliminating need for resampling to wavenumber domain


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FD-OCT systems require computationally expensive resampling to k-domain and suffer from speckle noise, needing more efficient methods

Method: Two sequential encoder-decoder networks: SD-CNN reconstructs morphological structures from degraded Fourier-transformed fringes, FD-CNN further optimizes image quality in Fourier domain

Result: Method achieves high-quality OCT images with reduced computational complexity and effective speckle suppression

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework for future innovations in OCT image reconstruction using deep learning

Abstract: Conventional Fourier-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) systems
depend on resampling into wavenumber (k) domain to extract the depth profile.
This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the
existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from
speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We
propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on
Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images
directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder
styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and
Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the
highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to
reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of
unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality
further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually
demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images.
Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing
the power of DL models. We believe that this work lays the framework for
further innovations in the realm of OCT image reconstruction.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MATA is a training-free method that dynamically increases attention to audio tokens in Large Audio-Language Models to address audio-textual attention imbalance, improving performance on audio reasoning tasks without adding parameters or computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LALMs suffer from audio-textual attention imbalance where they prioritize text over acoustic information, leading to suboptimal performance on audio reasoning tasks due to underutilization of acoustic cues.

Method: MATA intervenes post raw attention scoring in the self-attention mechanism, specifically targeting the last token in intermediate layers to push models to pay more attention to audio tokens dynamically.

Result: Experiments on MMAU and MMAR benchmarks show consistent performance gains, with MATA enabling an open-source model to surpass proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash on MMAR for the first time.

Conclusion: MATA provides an efficient solution to mitigate attention bias in multi-modal models and opens new research directions for enhancing audio-processing capabilities.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) often suffer from audio-textual attention
imbalance, prioritizing text over acoustic information, particularly in the
multi-modal fusion layers of the Transformer architecture. This bias hinders
their ability to fully utilize acoustic cues, causing suboptimal performance on
audio reasoning tasks. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{MATA}, a novel
training-free method that dynamically pushes LALMs to pay \textbf{M}ore
\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{T}o \textbf{A}udio tokens within the self-attention
mechanism. Specifically, MATA intervenes post raw attention scoring, targeting
only the last token in intermediate layers without introducing additional
parameters or computational overhead. Experiments on the MMAU and MMAR
benchmarks confirm MATA's effectiveness, with consistent performance gains.
Notably, on MMAR, MATA enables an open-source model to surpass the proprietary
Gemini 2.0 Flash for the first time. Our work provides an efficient solution to
mitigate attention bias and opens a new research direction for enhancing the
audio-processing capabilities of multi-modal models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ChiReSSD is a speech reconstruction framework that preserves children's speaker identity while correcting mispronunciations, particularly for children with speech sound disorders, with effective generalization to adult dysarthric speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches were trained on healthy adult speech, which doesn't adequately address the unique needs of children with speech sound disorders who have different pitch and prosody patterns.

Method: The framework uses disentangled, style-based text-to-speech reconstruction that adapts to children's voices with SSD, focusing on preserving pitch and prosody while correcting pronunciation errors.

Result: Substantial improvements in lexical accuracy and speaker identity preservation on the STAR dataset, with Pearson correlation of 0.63 between automatic and human expert annotations. Effective generalization demonstrated on the TORGO dataset for adult dysarthric speech.

Conclusion: Disentangled, style-based TTS reconstruction can provide identity-preserving speech correction across diverse clinical populations, potentially reducing manual transcription burden in clinical settings.

Abstract: We present ChiReSSD, a speech reconstruction framework that preserves
children speaker's identity while suppressing mispronunciations. Unlike prior
approaches trained on healthy adult speech, ChiReSSD adapts to the voices of
children with speech sound disorders (SSD), with particular emphasis on pitch
and prosody. We evaluate our method on the STAR dataset and report substantial
improvements in lexical accuracy and speaker identity preservation.
Furthermore, we automatically predict the phonetic content in the original and
reconstructed pairs, where the proportion of corrected consonants is comparable
to the percentage of correct consonants (PCC), a clinical speech assessment
metric. Our experiments show Pearson correlation of 0.63 between automatic and
human expert annotations, highlighting the potential to reduce the manual
transcription burden. In addition, experiments on the TORGO dataset demonstrate
effective generalization for reconstructing adult dysarthric speech. Our
results indicate that disentangled, style-based TTS reconstruction can provide
identity-preserving speech across diverse clinical populations.

*Richa Rawat,Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel Vision Transformer (ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer using pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model fine-tuned for binary and multi-class classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cancer detection methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and require expert pathologists. There's a need for automated, efficient diagnostic tools to improve early detection and survival rates.

Method: Uses pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model fine-tuned for classification tasks with a preprocessing pipeline that converts histopathological images into standardized PyTorch tensors. Evaluated on BreakHis (binary) and UBC-OCEAN (5-class) datasets without data augmentation.

Result: The model surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in binary classification, and demonstrates superior performance against recent topological methods in multi-class classification.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer-based transfer learning combined with efficient preprocessing is highly effective for oncological diagnostics, offering improved performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading health challenges for women, specifically breast
and ovarian cancer. Early detection can help improve the survival rate through
timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer
involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging
types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the
expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and
resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer
(ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We
use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both
binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available
histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that
converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which
are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model
performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark
datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN
dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model
surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in
binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against
recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study
highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning
combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.

*Georgii Kolokolnikov,Marie-Lena Schmalhofer,Sophie Götz,Lennart Well,Said Farschtschi,Victor-Felix Mautner,Inka Ristow,Rene Werner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MOIS-SAM2 is a novel interactive segmentation model that extends SAM2 with exemplar-based semantic propagation for efficient segmentation of neurofibromas in whole-body MRI, achieving superior performance over baselines with strong generalization across domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of neurofibromas in Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients, creating a need for more efficient clinical tools.

Method: MOIS-SAM2 extends the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation, trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients across different domain shift scenarios.

Result: MOIS-SAM2 achieved scan-wise DSC of 0.60 (vs. 0.54 for nnU-Net and 0.35 for SAM2), maintained performance under domain shifts, and showed model-to-expert agreement comparable to inter-expert variability.

Conclusion: MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of neurofibromas with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting clinical workflow integration.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder
characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the
body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and
longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation
methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds
of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored
to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation
model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was
trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using
T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient
level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three
reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength
variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of
0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC:
0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained
under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC:
0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1
scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader
variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68),
comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable
interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong
generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.

*Gaurav Seth,Hoa Pham,Giles Hamilton-Fletcher,Charles Leclercq,John-Ross Rizzo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Comparison of head-mounted vs hand-held visual assistive technologies for blind/low vision users, showing head-mounted reduces movement and task time but hand-held has higher success for small/curved text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical and functional implications of different device embodiments (head-mounted vs hand-held) for visual assistive technologies used by persons with blindness or low vision.

Method: 11 participants with blindness/low vision used Seeing AI on smartphone (hand-held) and ARx Vision system (head-mounted) to perform 6 daily activities. Motion capture tracked movements, measuring functional outcomes (task time, success rate, attempts) and biomechanical measures (joint range, movement smoothness, working volume).

Result: Head-mounted system reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for document-scanning tasks. Hand-held system yielded higher success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. Both embodiments are viable but differ in physical demands and ease of use.

Conclusion: Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology evaluations can optimize user experience by balancing functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.

Abstract: Visual assistive technologies, such as Microsoft Seeing AI, can improve
access to environmental information for persons with blindness or low vision
(pBLV). Yet, the physical and functional implications of different device
embodiments remain unclear. In this study, 11 pBLV participants used Seeing AI
on a hand-held smartphone and on a head-mounted ARx Vision system to perform
six activities of daily living, while their movements were captured with Xsens
motion capture. Functional outcomes included task time, success rate, and
number of attempts, and biomechanical measures included joint range of motion,
angular path length, working volume, and movement smoothness. The head-mounted
system generally reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for
document-scanning style tasks, whereas the hand-held system yielded higher
success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. These findings indicate
that both embodiments are viable, but they differ in terms of physical demands
and ease of use. Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology
evaluations can inform designs that optimise user experience by balancing
functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.

*Jiaqi Weng,Han Zheng,Hanyu Zhang,Qinqin He,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue,Zhixuan Chu,Xiting Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safe-SAIL is a framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to interpret safety-related features in LLMs, addressing the limitations of current safety research by systematically identifying and explaining safety-critical neurons to better understand and mitigate risks like toxic content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific tasks but fails to address broader undefined risks. Current SAE applications lack fine-grained safety concept interpretation, making them inadequate for analyzing safety-critical behaviors such as toxic response generation and regulation violations.

Method: The Safe-SAIL framework systematically identifies SAEs with the best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the interpretation process. It includes a toolkit with SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron explanations.

Result: The framework enables the extraction of a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture high-risk behaviors, overcoming challenges like identifying optimal SAEs and reducing the cost of detailed feature explanation.

Conclusion: Safe-SAIL advances mechanistic understanding in safety domains by providing comprehensive tools for empirical analysis of safety risks, promoting further research on LLM safety through released checkpoints and explanations.

Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world
applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research
focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their
ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)
facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining
single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever,
prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained
safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical
behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu-
lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set
of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors,
yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for
generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of
detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a
framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic
understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE
with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons,
and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process.
We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and
human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of
safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

TL;DR: PiMoE is a novel architecture that integrates computational capabilities into neural networks through physically-isolated mixture of experts, enabling efficient token-level alternation between computation and reasoning within a single chain of thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs cannot incorporate high-precision numerical computation as an intrinsic capability, and multi-agent approaches suffer from communication overhead, inefficient multimodal capabilities, and limited scalability.

Method: Proposes PiMoE architecture with separately trained experts, text-to-computation module, and router. The router directs computation and reasoning at token level for iterative alternation within a single chain of thought.

Result: PiMoE achieves higher accuracy than LLM finetuning and significant improvements in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared to multi-agent approaches.

Conclusion: PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent systems by endogenously integrating computational capabilities.

Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to
support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet
incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with
existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external
experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from
inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this
end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and
inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of
the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates
computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training
experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router
directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling
iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on
two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent
system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only
higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements
in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with
mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable,
and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, but LLMs' geospatial cognition capabilities remain underexplored due to non-quantifiable metrics, limited datasets, and unclear research hierarchies.

Method: Created a 36,000-route dataset from 12 global metropolises, introduced PathBuilder tool for natural language-route conversion, and proposed a new evaluation framework to assess 11 SOTA LLMs on route reversal tasks.

Result: LLMs exhibit significant limitations in reversing routes - most reverse routes neither return to starting points nor match optimal routes, with additional challenges including low robustness in route generation and high confidence for incorrect answers.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals critical gaps in LLMs' geospatial cognition capabilities, highlighting the need for improved spatial reasoning and confidence calibration in route-related tasks.

Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while
the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by
non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research
hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a
large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises
worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural
language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap
between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new
evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs
exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the
starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face
challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for
their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here:

TL;DR: Introduces COR benchmark and MCoT framework for egocentric-to-allocentric orientation reasoning in Traditional Chinese conversational navigation, achieving high accuracy even with ASR transcripts and noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of translating egocentric utterances to allocentric orientations in GPS-weak indoor environments, particularly for non-English and ASR-transcribed scenarios where multimodal spatial reasoning is underexplored.

Method: Proposes multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework integrating ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through three-step reasoning: spatial relation extraction, coordinate-to-direction mapping, and orientation inference. Uses curriculum learning on Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat.

Result: MCoT achieves 100% orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts, outperforming unimodal baselines. Demonstrates robustness to ASR errors, code-switching, domain shift, and linguistic variation.

Conclusion: Structured MCoT spatial reasoning shows potential for interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation, with strong performance in challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my
right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly
critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and
detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal
spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational
Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese
conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing
egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed
scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which
integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a
structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)
mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.
A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on
Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of
resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%
orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,
substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,
MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including
ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also
maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic
variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight
the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward
interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes PDE solution fields into smaller patches for efficient neural operator learning, reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PCA applied to high-dimensional PDE solution fields incurs significant computational overhead, which limits the efficiency of neural operator learning approaches.

Method: Proposes two patch-based PCA approaches: (1) local-to-global patch PCA and (2) local-to-local patch PCA, with refinements including overlapping patches with smoothing filters and CNN-based refinement.

Result: Patch-based PCA reduces computational complexity significantly, cutting end-to-end pipeline processing time by 3.7-4 times compared to global PCA while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Patch-based PCA is a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based systems, offering a good balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However,
applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields
incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a
patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller
patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the
reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that
balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1)
local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off
between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the
advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach,
we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i)
introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a
two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our
results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational
complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline
processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore
making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based
systems.

*Faizul Rakib Sayem,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel context optimization framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning for improved out-of-distribution detection in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples.

Method: Proposes a CoOp-based framework that projects ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space, using an end-to-end learning criterion.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The framework improves ID-OOD separability and achieves strong OOD detection performance while maintaining high ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world
settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using
only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt
learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking
the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs
trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace
representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD
separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt
vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space.
To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end
learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as
high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase
the effectiveness of our approach.

*Yang Li,Chenyu Wang,Tingrui Wang,Yongwei Wang,Haonan Li,Zhunga Liu,Quan Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JAD is a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks that uses joint attention distillation from CNN and ViT models to generate architecture-agnostic adversarial examples with improved transferability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box adversarial attack methods have limited cross-architecture transferability and high query costs due to dependency on specific network architectures or requiring numerous queries.

Method: JAD generates adversarial examples using a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both CNN and Vision Transformer models, focusing on commonly sensitive image regions across architectures.

Result: Experiments show JAD achieves superior attack generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: JAD provides a promising and effective paradigm for black-box adversarial attacks by being architecture-agnostic and reducing reliance on iterative queries through its generative diffusion framework.

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to
model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network
architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited
cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these
limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box
adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent
diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on
image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach
crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different
model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be
architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse
models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high
adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative
queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack
generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability
compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for
black-box adversarial attacks.

### [221] [Neural Network-Driven Direct CBCT-Based Dose Calculation for Head-and-Neck Proton Treatment Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18378)
*Muheng Li,Evangelia Choulilitsa,Lisa Fankhauser,Francesca Albertini,Antony Lomax,Ye Zhang*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep learning approach using xLSTM neural networks for direct proton dose calculation from CBCT images, achieving high accuracy comparable to Monte Carlo methods with faster computation times suitable for adaptive radiotherapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CBCT-based dose calculation suffers from image quality limitations requiring complex correction workflows, which is problematic for adaptive proton treatment planning that needs to account for inter-fractional anatomical changes.

Method: Used an xLSTM-based neural network (CBCT-NN) trained on 40 head-and-neck cancer patients with paired planning CT and treatment CBCT images. The architecture incorporates energy token encoding and beam's-eye-view sequence modeling to capture spatial dependencies in proton dose deposition patterns, trained on 82,500 paired beam configurations with Monte Carlo-generated ground truth doses.

Result: Achieved gamma pass rates of 95.1±2.7% using 2mm/2% criteria, mean percentage dose errors of 2.6±1.4% in high-dose regions and 5.9±1.9% globally. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed excellent preservation of target coverage and organ-at-risk constraints. Computation time under 3 minutes.

Conclusion: Demonstrates proof-of-principle for direct CBCT-based proton dose calculation using xLSTM neural networks, eliminating traditional correction workflows while achieving comparable accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for adaptive protocols.

Abstract: Accurate dose calculation on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is
essential for modern proton treatment planning workflows, particularly when
accounting for inter-fractional anatomical changes in adaptive treatment
scenarios. Traditional CBCT-based dose calculation suffers from image quality
limitations, requiring complex correction workflows. This study develops and
validates a deep learning approach for direct proton dose calculation from CBCT
images using extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) neural networks. A
retrospective dataset of 40 head-and-neck cancer patients with paired planning
CT and treatment CBCT images was used to train an xLSTM-based neural network
(CBCT-NN). The architecture incorporates energy token encoding and
beam's-eye-view sequence modelling to capture spatial dependencies in proton
dose deposition patterns. Training utilized 82,500 paired beam configurations
with Monte Carlo-generated ground truth doses. Validation was performed on 5
independent patients using gamma analysis, mean percentage dose error
assessment, and dose-volume histogram comparison. The CBCT-NN achieved gamma
pass rates of 95.1 $\pm$ 2.7% using 2mm/2% criteria. Mean percentage dose
errors were 2.6 $\pm$ 1.4% in high-dose regions ($>$90% of max dose) and 5.9
$\pm$ 1.9% globally. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed excellent
preservation of target coverage metrics (Clinical Target Volume V95%
difference: -0.6 $\pm$ 1.1%) and organ-at-risk constraints (parotid mean dose
difference: -0.5 $\pm$ 1.5%). Computation time is under 3 minutes without
sacrificing Monte Carlo-level accuracy. This study demonstrates the
proof-of-principle of direct CBCT-based proton dose calculation using xLSTM
neural networks. The approach eliminates traditional correction workflows while
achieving comparable accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for
adaptive protocols.
