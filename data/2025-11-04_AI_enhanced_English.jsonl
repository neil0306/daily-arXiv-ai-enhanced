Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between reasoning\nlength and accuracy, where across multiple stochastic decodes, the short\nreasoning paths consistently achieve the highest correctness, while longer ones\naccumulate errors and repetitions. These short optimal reasoning paths can be\nfound ideally through full enumeration of the reasoning space. However, the\ntree-structured reasoning space grows exponentially with sequence length,\nrendering exhaustive exploration infeasible. To address this, we propose DTS, a\nmodel-agnostic decoding framework that sketches the reasoning space by\nselectively branching at high-entropy tokens and applies early stopping to\nselect the shortest completed reasoning path. This approach approximates the\noptimal solution that enhances both efficiency and accuracy, without requiring\nadditional training or supervision. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025\ndatasets with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and 1.5B show that DTS improves\naccuracy by up to 8%, reduces average reasoning length by 23%, and decreases\nrepetition frequency by 12%, demonstrating DTS's ability for scalable and\nefficient LRM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTS is a model-agnostic decoding framework that addresses overthinking in Large Reasoning Models by selectively branching at high-entropy tokens and using early stopping to find shorter, more accurate reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy without additional training.", "motivation": "Large Reasoning Models often suffer from overthinking, producing excessively long chain-of-thought traces that increase inference costs and may degrade accuracy.

Recent work integrates future images into the\nunderstanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,\ngenerate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and\nactions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality\nunification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate\nprocesses, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our\ncore philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a\nsynchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions\nto evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.\nWe ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process\nthat integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve\nas the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be\nintrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified\ntokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further\npropose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques\nthat optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and\nSimplerEnv with 4$\\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world\nevaluations.

Real stochastic processes\nexhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range\ndependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured\nin standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion\n(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving\ngenerative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from\npaired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nbridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data\ntranslation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein\nconformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation.
