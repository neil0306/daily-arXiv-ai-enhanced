### [1] [Modeling Layered Consciousness with Multi-Agent Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17844)
*Sang Hun Kim,Jongmin Lee,Dongkyu Park,So Young Lee,Yosep Chong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for modeling artificial consciousness in LLMs using psychoanalytic theory, featuring self-awareness, preconsciousness, and unconsciousness simulation through agent interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop artificial consciousness in large language models by incorporating psychoanalytic principles to create more adaptive and personalized cognitive systems.

Method: Multi-agent framework with Psychodynamic Model simulating psychoanalytic concepts, Personalization Module with fixed traits and dynamic needs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning on emotionally rich dialogues.

Result: 71.2% preference for fine-tuned model over baseline, with improved emotional depth and reduced output variance across eight personalized conditions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for creating adaptive, personalized artificial consciousness in LLMs through psychoanalytic-inspired multi-agent modeling.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent framework for modeling artificial consciousness in
large language models (LLMs), grounded in psychoanalytic theory. Our
\textbf{Psychodynamic Model} simulates self-awareness, preconsciousness, and
unconsciousness through agent interaction, guided by a Personalization Module
combining fixed traits and dynamic needs. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
on emotionally rich dialogues, the system was evaluated across eight
personalized conditions. An LLM as a judge approach showed a 71.2\% preference
for the fine-tuned model, with improved emotional depth and reduced output
variance, demonstrating its potential for adaptive, personalized cognition.

### [2] [Outraged AI: Large language models prioritise emotion over cost in fairness enforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17880)
*Hao Liu,Yiqing Dai,Haotian Tan,Yu Lei,Yujia Zhou,Zhen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs use emotion to guide moral decisions in third-party punishment scenarios, sometimes more strongly than humans, but with key differences in cost sensitivity and fairness balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models use emotion similarly to humans in moral decision-making, specifically in altruistic third-party punishment scenarios that are hallmarks of human morality.

Method: Large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions using altruistic third-party punishment tasks where observers incur personal costs to enforce fairness.

Result: LLMs used emotion to guide punishment decisions - unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion leading to more punishment, and emotion self-reports causally increased punishment. However, LLMs prioritized emotion over cost with reduced cost sensitivity, while humans balanced fairness and cost. Reasoning models were more cost-sensitive than foundation models.

Conclusion: This provides first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs, revealing deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgments. LLMs appear to progress along a trajectory paralleling human development, suggesting future models should integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning.

Abstract: Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use
emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party
punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a
hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a
large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100
decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly
than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more
punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting;
and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased
punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost,
enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity,
whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini,
DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than
foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven.
These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral
decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness
judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs
progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should
integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like
emotional intelligence.

### [3] [POPI: Personalizing LLMs via Optimized Natural Language Preference Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17881)
*Yizhuo Chen,Xin Liu,Ruijie Wang,Zheng Li,Pei Chen,Changlong Yu,Priyanka Nigam,Meng Jiang,Bing Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POPI is a framework that uses a preference inference model to distill user signals into natural language summaries, which then condition a shared generation model to produce personalized responses, improving accuracy while reducing context overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques like RLHF and DPO optimize for population-level averages and overlook individual variation, while naive personalization strategies are computationally prohibitive or inefficient.

Method: POPI introduces a preference inference model to distill user signals into natural language summaries, then uses these summaries to condition a shared generation model. It jointly optimizes both components using reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments across four benchmarks show POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while significantly reducing context overhead. Optimized summaries also transfer to frozen LLMs without weight updates.

Conclusion: POPI provides an effective framework for personalizing LLM responses through transparent preference summaries that enable plug-and-play personalization without the computational cost of fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user
experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and
reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and
overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user
fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that
prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address
these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a
preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise
natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and
transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation
model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference
inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using
reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference
information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks
demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while
reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries
seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play
personalization without weight updates.

### [4] [Advances in Pre-trained Language Models for Domain-Specific Text Classification: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17892)
*Zhyar Rzgar K. Rostam,Gábor Kertész*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This systematic literature review examines pre-trained language models (PLMs) for domain-specific text classification, analyzing 41 articles from 2018-2024 and conducting comparative experiments with BERT variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of scientific literature requires efficient text classification methods, but LLMs struggle with domain-specific contexts due to specialized vocabulary, unique grammar, and imbalanced data distributions.

Method: Conducted systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, analyzed 41 articles, categorized research by PLMs, proposed taxonomy of techniques, and performed comparative experiments with BERT, SciBERT, and BioBERT for biomedical sentence classification.

Result: The review provides comprehensive analysis of PLM evolution, transformer-based models, domain-specific challenges, and comparative performance across different domains, with experimental validation in biomedical classification.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into current PLM applications for domain-specific text classification, identifies limitations, and suggests future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: The exponential increase in scientific literature and online information
necessitates efficient methods for extracting knowledge from textual data.
Natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in addressing this
challenge, particularly in text classification tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in NLP, their accuracy can
suffer in domain-specific contexts due to specialized vocabulary, unique
grammatical structures, and imbalanced data distributions. In this systematic
literature review (SLR), we investigate the utilization of pre-trained language
models (PLMs) for domain-specific text classification. We systematically review
41 articles published between 2018 and January 2024, adhering to the PRISMA
statement (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses).
This review methodology involved rigorous inclusion criteria and a multi-step
selection process employing AI-powered tools. We delve into the evolution of
text classification techniques and differentiate between traditional and modern
approaches. We emphasize transformer-based models and explore the challenges
and considerations associated with using LLMs for domain-specific text
classification. Furthermore, we categorize existing research based on various
PLMs and propose a taxonomy of techniques used in the field. To validate our
findings, we conducted a comparative experiment involving BERT, SciBERT, and
BioBERT in biomedical sentence classification. Finally, we present a
comparative study on the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks
across different domains. In addition, we examine recent advancements in PLMs
for domain-specific text classification and offer insights into future
directions and limitations in this rapidly evolving domain.

### [5] [Atomic Literary Styling: Mechanistic Manipulation of Prose Generation in Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17909)
*Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of GPT-2 neurons that distinguish literary vs AI text shows discriminative neurons paradoxically harm rather than help prose generation quality when removed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks encode literary style and test whether neurons that correlate with good writing actually cause it during generation.

Method: Used Herman Melville's Bartleby as corpus, analyzed 32,768 neurons in GPT-2's late layers, identified discriminative neurons, and conducted systematic ablation studies.

Result: Found 27,122 statistically significant discriminative neurons, but ablating 50 top neurons improved literary style metrics by 25.7%, showing correlation doesn't equal causation.

Conclusion: There's a critical gap between observational correlation and causal necessity in neural networks - neurons that activate on good inputs don't necessarily produce good outputs.

Abstract: We present a mechanistic analysis of literary style in GPT-2, identifying
individual neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and rigid
AI-generated text. Using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus,
we extract activation patterns from 355 million parameters across 32,768
neurons in late layers. We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative
neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic
ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons
correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves
rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50
high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style
metrics. This demonstrates a critical gap between observational correlation and
causal necessity in neural networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that
neurons which activate on desirable inputs will produce those outputs during
generation, with implications for mechanistic interpretability research and AI
alignment.

### [6] [JT-Safe: Intrinsically Enhancing the Safety and Trustworthiness of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17918)
*Junlan Feng,Fanyu Meng,Chong Long,Pengyu Cong,Duqing Wang,Yan Zheng,Yuyao Zhang,Xuanchang Gao,Ye Yuan,Yunfei Ma,Zhijie Ren,Fan Yang,Na Wu,Di Jin,Chao Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing pre-training data with world context (DWC) to address LLM hallucinations and safety issues, achieving 1.79% improvement on safety benchmarks with only 6.2 trillion tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations and safety concerns in LLMs originate from pre-training data issues - factual errors, logical inconsistencies, distributional biases, and lack of real-world grounding. Current approaches focus on post-training, but the root causes are in pre-training.

Method: Proposes Data with World Context (DWC) approach that incorporates real-world context information into pre-training data. Continues pre-training JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion DWC tokens and uses post-training procedures to activate DWC's potential.

Result: JT-Safe-35B achieves 1.79% average performance improvement on Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks compared to similar-scale Qwen model, while being pre-trained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

Conclusion: Enhancing pre-training data with world context (DWC) effectively improves LLM safety and trustworthiness by anchoring data in real-world scenarios, reducing training uncertainty, and achieving better performance with fewer tokens.

Abstract: The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs)
are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a
significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference
techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that
unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,
involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.
In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost
impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical
inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack
grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence
of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome
these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its
context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting
industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors
for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a
role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we
aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby
reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and
trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue
pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC
tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of
DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an
average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy
evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

### [7] [CLAWS:Creativity detection for LLM-generated solutions using Attention Window of Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17921)
*Keuntae Kim,Eunhye Jeong,Sehyeon Lee,Seohee Yoon,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAWS is a method that classifies mathematical solutions from LLMs into typical, creative, and hallucinated categories using attention weights, outperforming existing detection methods without human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite improvements in LLM reasoning accuracy, creativity assessment in reasoning tasks has been overlooked due to challenges in defining creativity range and requiring human evaluation.

Method: CLAWS leverages attention weights across prompt sections and output to classify mathematical solutions into three categories without human evaluation.

Result: CLAWS outperforms five existing white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden Score, Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models across 4545 math problems from 181 contests.

Conclusion: CLAWS successfully addresses the challenges of creativity assessment in reasoning tasks by providing automated classification of solution types using attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models
(LLMs) have been remarkably successful. LLMs trained with reinforcement
learning (RL) for reasoning demonstrate strong performance in challenging tasks
such as mathematics and coding, even with relatively small model sizes.
However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of
creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks,
in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in
reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining
the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the
assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method
that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and
hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention
weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing
white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden
Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen,
Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal). We validate CLAWS on 4545 math problems
collected from 181 math contests (AJHSME, AMC, AIME).

### [8] [Select-Then-Decompose: From Empirical Analysis to Adaptive Selection Strategy for Task Decomposition in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17922)
*Shuodi Liu,Yingzhuo Liu,Zi Wang,Yusheng Wang,Huijia Wu,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Select-Then-Decompose, a dynamic strategy that optimizes the performance-cost trade-off in LLM task decomposition by selecting appropriate approaches based on task characteristics and verifying results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task decomposition methods focus on memory, tool usage, and feedback but overlook the critical trade-off between performance and cost, creating a need for more balanced approaches.

Method: The Select-Then-Decompose strategy establishes a closed-loop process with three stages: selection (choosing suitable decomposition approach), execution, and verification (enhancing result reliability).

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, demonstrating optimal balance between performance and cost.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively addresses the performance-cost trade-off in task decomposition and provides practical principles for dynamic approach selection based on task characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and
planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition.
Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and
feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they
often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we
first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying
six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three
factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition:
categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of
decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and
summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we
propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop
problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and
verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition
approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the
results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on
the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and
cost. Our code is publicly available at

### [9] [Efficient Toxicity Detection in Gaming Chats: A Comparative Study of Embeddings, Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17924)
*Yehor Tereshchenko,Mika Hämäläinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of NLP methods for toxicity detection in gaming chats, evaluating traditional ML, LLMs, fine-tuned transformers, and RAG approaches across accuracy, speed, and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective content moderation systems for dynamic online gaming environments by identifying optimal NLP methods that balance performance with computational efficiency.

Method: Evaluated traditional ML models with embeddings, LLMs with zero-shot/few-shot prompting, fine-tuned transformer models, and RAG approaches. Proposed hybrid moderation system with automated detection and continuous learning mechanisms.

Result: Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. Significant performance variations observed across different methods, with empirical evidence supporting cost-effective deployment.

Conclusion: The findings enable deployment of efficient content moderation systems in gaming environments, with fine-tuned DistilBERT providing the best balance between accuracy and computational costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods for automated toxicity detection in online gaming
chats. Traditional machine learning models with embeddings, large language
models (LLMs) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting, fine-tuned transformer
models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches are evaluated. The
evaluation framework assesses three critical dimensions: classification
accuracy, processing speed, and computational costs. A hybrid moderation system
architecture is proposed that optimizes human moderator workload through
automated detection and incorporates continuous learning mechanisms. The
experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across
methods, with fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.
The findings provide empirical evidence for deploying cost-effective, efficient
content moderation systems in dynamic online gaming environments.

### [10] [Diagnosing Representation Dynamics in NER Model Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17930)
*Xirui Zhang,Philippe de La Chevasnerie,Benoit Fabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Joint fine-tuning of BERT NER models on standard entities and new PII entities shows minimal degradation, with LOC being vulnerable due to representation overlap with PII patterns, and 'O' tag plasticity being crucial for adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend NER models to new PII entities in noisy spoken-language data while maintaining performance on original semantic entities.

Method: Used incremental learning as a diagnostic tool to measure semantic drift, analyzed representation overlap, and investigated 'O' tag classifier plasticity by unfreezing it during adaptation.

Result: LOC entity is uniquely vulnerable due to pattern-like feature overlap with PII; 'O' tag representation drift blocks new learning until the classifier is unfrozen, allowing background class adaptation.

Conclusion: NER model adaptation involves feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag plasticity, providing mechanistic insights for extending models to new entity types.

Abstract: Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy
spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT
model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII
(EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We
investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses
independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.
  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic
drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely
vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares
pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse
O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns
to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's
classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these
patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation,
highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag
plasticity.

### [11] [AtlasKV: Augmenting LLMs with Billion-Scale Knowledge Graphs in 20GB VRAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17934)
*Haoyu Huang,Hong Ting Tsang,Jiaxin Bai,Xi Peng,Gong Zhang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AtlasKV is a parametric knowledge integration method that augments LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs using minimal GPU memory, eliminating the need for external retrievers and long context processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG methods introduce substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and long context processing, especially for large-scale knowledge augmentation.

Method: Introduces KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with sub-linear time and memory complexity, leveraging LLMs' inherent attention mechanism.

Result: Achieves scalable knowledge integration with less than 20GB VRAM for billion-scale KGs, maintaining strong knowledge grounding and generalization.

Conclusion: AtlasKV provides an effective, general way to augment LLMs with large-scale knowledge without external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining for new knowledge.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting
large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a
non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily
rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior.
Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce
substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer
relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration
method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to
augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using
very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we
introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with
sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding
and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism,
and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when
adapting to new knowledge.

### [12] [Believe It or Not: How Deeply do LLMs Believe Implanted Facts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17941)
*Stewart Slocum,Julian Minder,Clément Dumas,Henry Sleight,Ryan Greenblatt,Samuel Marks,Rowan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework to measure belief depth in LLMs after knowledge editing, finding that most techniques fail to implant deep beliefs while Synthetic Document Finetuning shows better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether knowledge editing techniques actually make LLMs believe the implanted facts, rather than just superficially incorporating them.

Method: Developed a framework measuring belief depth through three criteria: generalization to related contexts, robustness to challenge/scrutiny, and similarity to genuine knowledge representation using linear probes. Evaluated various editing techniques including prompting, mechanistic editing, and Synthetic Document Finetuning.

Result: Simple prompting and mechanistic editing fail to implant knowledge deeply. Synthetic Document Finetuning often succeeds at creating beliefs that behave like genuine knowledge, but fails when implanted beliefs contradict basic world knowledge.

Conclusion: The work provides measurable criteria for belief depth and enables rigorous evaluation of knowledge editing techniques, showing that current methods have limitations in creating truly deep beliefs in LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into
large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We
develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success
of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent
to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi
estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and
direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as
measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and
mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast,
Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated
documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that
behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal,
as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and
representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work
introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous
evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world
applications.

### [13] [SimBA: Simplifying Benchmark Analysis Using Performance Matrices Alone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17998)
*Nishant Subramani,Alfredo Gomez,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimBA is a three-phase framework (stalk, prowl, pounce) that simplifies benchmark analysis for language models by identifying representative dataset subsets that can predict full benchmark performance with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language model benchmarks are large and difficult to interpret for model selection, requiring a systematic approach to simplify analysis and improve efficiency.

Method: Three-phase framework: 1) Stalk - conduct dataset & model comparisons, 2) Prowl - discover representative subsets using a coverage algorithm, 3) Pounce - use subsets to predict performance on held-out models.

Result: Achieved 95%+ coverage with small subsets: 6.25% (1/16) for HELM, 1.7% (1/58) for MMLU, and 28.4% (21/74) for BigBenchLite. Can preserve model ranks and predict performance with near zero mean-squared error.

Conclusion: SimBA helps model developers improve training efficiency and dataset creators validate new datasets, demonstrating that small representative subsets can effectively capture benchmark performance.

Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult
to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation
numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase
framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk,
where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a
representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to
predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three
popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all
three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk).
We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark
using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%
(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and
BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).
Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve
model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero
mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers
improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether
their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our
code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.

### [14] [Is Multilingual LLM Watermarking Truly Multilingual? A Simple Back-Translation Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18019)
*Asim Mohamed,Martin Gubri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing multilingual watermarking methods fail in medium- and low-resource languages due to semantic clustering issues. STEAM introduces a back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost through translation, achieving significant improvements across 17 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual watermarking methods claim cross-lingual robustness but are only evaluated on high-resource languages, failing in medium- and low-resource languages under translation attacks.

Method: STEAM uses back-translation-based detection to restore watermark strength lost through translation. It's compatible with any watermarking method, robust across tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable.

Result: STEAM achieves average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17 languages, demonstrating significant improvement in watermark detection performance across diverse languages.

Conclusion: STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking across diverse languages, addressing the limitations of existing methods in medium- and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs
traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite
claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource
languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not
truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in
medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic
clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few
full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a
back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost
through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust
across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable
to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17
languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking
across diverse languages.

TL;DR: GISP is a global iterative structured pruning method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using loss-based importance weights with block-wise normalization, enabling task-specific pruning without intermediate fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing local structured pruning methods are task-agnostic and optimize layer-wise reconstruction rather than task objectives, failing to leverage task-specific calibration signals for better downstream performance.

Method: Global iterative structured pruning using first-order loss-based importance weights aggregated at structure level with block-wise normalization, employing iterative schedule to stabilize accuracy without intermediate fine-tuning.

Result: Consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves downstream accuracy across multiple LLMs (Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, Mistral-0.3-7B), with strong gains at 40-50% sparsity. Task-aligned calibration boosts GSM8K exact-match accuracy.

Conclusion: GISP enables effective global structured pruning that supports task-specific objectives, stabilizes accuracy at high sparsity, and creates nested subnetworks for 'prune-once, deploy-many' workflow.

Abstract: Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models
(LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures.
However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise
reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or
generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific
calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global
structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a
post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using
first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level
with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot
pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity
collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory
also forms nested subnetworks that support a "prune-once, deploy-many"
workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss,
GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for
language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks.
Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and
Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves
downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration
substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.

*Mahsa Valizadeh,Xiangjue Dong,Rui Tuo,James Caverlee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMAR is an LLM-driven framework that automatically enriches sequential interaction data by generating auxiliary contextual signals like inferred usage scenarios and item intents, improving performance in sequential modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well with rich semantic context but struggle with sequential interaction data when semantic context is limited or absent, creating a need for automatic semantic enrichment.

Method: LaMAR uses LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate contextual signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of user intent and item relationships from existing metadata, then augments original sequences with these generated signals.

Result: The framework consistently improves performance in benchmark sequential modeling tasks, with generated signals showing high semantic novelty and diversity that enhances downstream models' representational capacity.

Conclusion: LaMAR represents a new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators, providing a semi-automatic method for creating training data and language resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and
contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user
behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such
semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven
semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically.
LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual
signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item
relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred
usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original
sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this
generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks,
where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that
LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing
the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a
new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators,
contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and
language resources.

*Shabnam Ataee,Andrei Popescu-Belis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well large language models handle inter-sentential dependencies in English-French translation, testing 12 LLMs on distinguishing correct translations and generating translations, with chain-of-thought reasoning improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capacity to translate texts with inter-sentential dependencies, particularly pronominal anaphora and lexical cohesion challenges that require understanding relationships across sentences.

Method: Used the DiscEvalMT benchmark with sentence pairs containing translation challenges. Evaluated 12 LLMs from DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families on two tasks: distinguishing correct vs. wrong translations and generating translations. Compared prompts with and without chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Best models achieved ~90% accuracy on discrimination task and ~92% COMET scores on generation task. GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi performed best. Chain-of-thought reasoning improved performance, with a 'wise get wiser' effect where better models benefited more from reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively handle inter-sentential dependencies in translation, with reasoning prompts significantly enhancing performance, particularly for already capable models.

Abstract: This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate
texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French
DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing
translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion.
We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families
on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but
plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that
encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models
take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and
COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi
standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements
through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models
without reasoning.

Motivation: To explore how Large Language Models can be used to predict player actions in Dungeons & Dragons games and automatically generate appropriate Avrae Discord bot commands for gameplay automation.

Method: Evaluated two models - DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B (reasoning model) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (instruct model) - using the FIREBALL dataset for command generation, with analysis of how prompt instructions affect model outputs.

Result: Found that instruct models are sufficient for this task compared to reasoning models, and discovered that even single sentence changes in prompts can greatly affect model outputs, highlighting the importance of specific instructions.

Conclusion: Instruct models provide adequate performance for DnD command generation tasks, and careful prompt engineering is crucial for obtaining desired outputs from language models in this domain.

### [20] [LLMs Encode How Difficult Problems Are](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18147)
*William Lugoloobi,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs encode human-judged problem difficulty in their representations, which correlates with generalization during RL training, while automated difficulty estimates become misaligned as models improve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs internally represent problem difficulty in alignment with human judgment and how this representation tracks generalization during reinforcement learning post-training.

Method: Trained linear probes across layers and token positions on 60 models using mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench, and conducted steering experiments and GRPO training analysis.

Result: Human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable (ρ≈0.88) with clear model-size scaling, while LLM-derived difficulty is weaker and scales poorly. Steering toward "easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy.

Conclusion: Human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates become misaligned as models improve, suggesting human judgment is crucial for tracking model generalization.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex
problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether
LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human
judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during
reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and
token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of
Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly
decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling,
whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly.
Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward
"easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During
GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and
positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the
LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These
results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that
RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model
performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe
code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

### [21] [Extracting Rule-based Descriptions of Attention Features in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18148)
*Dan Friedman,Adithya Bhaskar,Alexander Wettig,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes rule-based descriptions as an alternative to sparse feature analysis for mechanistic interpretability, introducing three types of rules (skip-gram, absence, and counting) that can be automatically extracted from transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability methods only identify which text sequences activate features but require subjective inspection for actual interpretation. The paper aims to provide more objective and comprehensive rule-based descriptions.

Method: The authors extract rule-based descriptions from SAE features trained on attention layers, treating attention as interactions between input/output features. They develop a simple approach to automatically extract three rule types from transformers.

Result: Applied to GPT-2 small, they found most features can be described with ~100 skip-gram rules, over a fourth of first-layer features use absence rules, and identified some counting rules. Manual inspection often reveals misleading explanations.

Conclusion: The paper establishes groundwork for rule-based feature descriptions by defining them, showing extraction methods, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of represented behaviors.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of
bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a
sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only
identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual
interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.
This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that
match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the
likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based
descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While
prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may
naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output
features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form
"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English", (2) absence rules of the form
"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only
when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.
Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of
exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or
incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these
types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.
We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100
skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first
layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of
counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into
rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be
extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they
represent.

*Yohei Ikenoue,Hitomi Tashiro,Shigeru Kuroyanagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for adaptive prompt generation that automatically selects appropriate prompting techniques based on task descriptions, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt engineering requires specialized knowledge and deep task understanding, creating barriers for non-experts to effectively use LLMs.

Method: Constructs a knowledge base associating task clusters with prompting techniques, then dynamically generates prompts by matching user task descriptions to relevant clusters and integrating appropriate techniques.

Result: Superior performance on 23 BIG-Bench Extra Hard tasks compared to standard prompts and existing automatic prompt-generation tools, measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean scores.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for streamlining and standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage LLMs without requiring specialized prompting knowledge.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs
from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized
knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects
task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task
descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying
on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a
knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic
similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques.
When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most
relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating
techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the
proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates
superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic
prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean
scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and
standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CMT-Bench is a diagnostic benchmark for text-to-table systems using cricket commentary that tests LLM robustness through extractive-cue ablation, temporal prefixing, and entity-form perturbations, revealing brittleness in dynamic table generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven text-to-table systems rely on computationally expensive methods that obscure how models reason about temporal narratives, motivating the need for diagnostic benchmarks to assess true reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created CMT-Bench from live cricket commentary requiring dynamic table generation across evolving schemas under dense rules, with three robustness tests: extractive-cue ablation, temporal prefixing, and entity-form perturbations.

Result: Found large performance drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation with input length, and consistent accuracy drops under entity-form changes, with distributional tests showing reasoning drift rather than noise.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are brittle in dynamic text-to-table generation, highlighting the need for robustness-first evaluation as prerequisite for developing efficient and scalable approaches.

Abstract: LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive
prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats,
which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models
actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information.
We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary
that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a
dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via
three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate
extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test
long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization,
outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess
sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art
LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation
with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes.
Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error
patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results
show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation,
motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing
efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

*Yoshinari Fujinuma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs used as evaluators suffer from score range bias in direct assessment tasks, where their outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges. The paper proposes contrastive decoding to mitigate this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are commonly used as evaluators, but their reliability in direct assessment tasks (assigning scores without references) remains challenging due to biases in score range sensitivity.

Method: The authors identify score range bias in LLM judges and propose using contrastive decoding to mitigate this bias, which helps reduce sensitivity to pre-defined score ranges.

Result: The proposed contrastive decoding method achieves up to 11.3% relative improvement on average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score ranges.

Conclusion: Contrastive decoding effectively mitigates score range bias in LLM evaluators, improving their reliability in direct assessment tasks and enabling better correlation with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various
applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such
challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores
from a specified range without any references. We first show that this
challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias,
i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges,
preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar
biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias
through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on
average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score
ranges.

TL;DR: DelvePO is a task-agnostic framework that optimizes prompts through self-evolution by decoupling prompts into components and using working memory to guide generation, outperforming previous methods across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods rely on random LLM rewriting and focus on specific factors, leading to local optima and unstable performance that limits transferability across tasks.

Method: Decouples prompts into components to explore different factors' impact, introduces working memory to alleviate LLM uncertainties and guide new prompt generation in a self-evolving manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on various tasks and LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini) show DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA methods.

Conclusion: DelvePO demonstrates effectiveness and transferability across different tasks, providing a robust framework for flexible prompt optimization.

Abstract: Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities
in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current
works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization
process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to
fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is
often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address
the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$
($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving
Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a
task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our
framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to
explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this
basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the
deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights
to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on
different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.
Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA
methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness
and transferability across different tasks.

TL;DR: Visual text compression: rendering text as images reduces token usage in LLMs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce token usage in LLMs by compressing textual inputs through visual representations.

Method: Render long text inputs as single images and feed them directly to decoder LLMs.

Result: Substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading performance on RULER and CNN/DailyMail benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual text representations are a practical and effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process
visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question:
can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage
while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text
representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input
compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs
as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to
dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of
input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER
(long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we
demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings
(often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Braille is crucial for visually impaired education but faces data scarcity and mixed-text ambiguities, requiring better processing methods for diverse Braille applications.

Method: Constructed EBMD/CBMD datasets with mathematical formulas, developed syntax tree-based augmentation for Braille data, and proposed Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT) via instruction tuning for unified Braille translation tasks.

Result: BKFT achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in Braille translation scenarios, enabling unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille conversion, and mixed-text translation.

Conclusion: The open-sourced datasets and BKFT methodology establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research, addressing key challenges in Braille information processing.

Abstract: Braille plays a vital role in education and information accessibility for
visually impaired individuals. However, Braille information processing faces
challenges such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. We
construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with
mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a
syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the
underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks,
we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the
learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via
instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille
conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT
achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in
Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies
establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Food4All is a multi-agent framework for real-time, context-aware free food retrieval that addresses limitations in existing systems by aggregating heterogeneous data, using reinforcement learning for optimization, and incorporating dynamic feedback loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmented access to food resources despite thousands of food banks/pantries, where current systems provide incomplete results, vague suggestions, and overlook survival-critical needs of food-insecure populations.

Method: Unifies three innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases, community platforms, and social media; 2) lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on curated cases; 3) online feedback loop for dynamic policy adaptation.

Result: Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated guidance at the point of need by bridging information acquisition, semantic analysis, and decision support.

Conclusion: Establishes a step toward scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.

Abstract: Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United
States, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid
misuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,
access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static
directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and
geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague
nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as
time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems
optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of
food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified
availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most
vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital
illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we
introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for
real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three
innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,
community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of
food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on
curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional
correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval
policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic
analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and
guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward
scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations
facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.

### [30] [From Retrieval to Generation: Unifying External and Parametric Knowledge for Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18297)
*Lei Li,Xiao Zhou,Yingying Zhang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedRGAG is a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation for medical QA, addressing limitations of both RAG (noisy retrieval) and GAG (hallucinated information) through knowledge-guided context completion and adaptive document selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for medical QA either rely on external retrieval (RAG) which suffers from noisy/incomplete results, or internal generation (GAG) which is prone to hallucinations. Both issues undermine answer reliability in medical contexts where accuracy is critical.

Method: MedRGAG combines two modules: Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC) to generate background documents that complement missing retrieved knowledge, and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS) to adaptively select optimal combinations of retrieved and generated documents for evidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on five medical QA benchmarks show MedRGAG achieves 12.5% improvement over MedRAG and 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, demonstrating superior performance in knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed MedRGAG framework effectively unifies retrieval and generation for medical QA, providing more reliable answers by leveraging both external and parametric knowledge sources while mitigating their individual limitations.

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific
knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge
stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two
categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning
on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),
which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual
documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while
GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to
unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine
answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified
retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external
and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:
Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to
produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by
retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively
selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form
concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments
on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%
improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the
effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive
reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at

*Lara Ahrens,Wilhelm Haverkamp,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain-adapted LLMs via finetuning and RAG achieve competitive performance with proprietary models in electrocardiography, supporting privacy-preserving clinical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize optimal adaptation strategies and performance of open-weight LLMs in healthcare applications, particularly for privacy-preserving local deployment in electrocardiography.

Method: Finetuned open-weight models on domain-specific literature and implemented multi-layered evaluation framework comparing finetuned models, RAG, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 as general-purpose model reference.

Result: Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved superior performance on multiple-choice and automatic text metrics, ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human experts favored Claude 3.7 and RAG for complex queries. Finetuned models significantly outperformed base counterparts across nearly all evaluations.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting viability of privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions despite substantial performance heterogeneity across evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising
healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal
assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy
preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies,
and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized.
We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of
cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific
literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing
finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7
as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved
superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics,
ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert
evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned
models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all
evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity
across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity.
Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of
privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

*Vipul Rathore,Malik Hammad Faisal,Parag Singla,Mausam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HYDRE is a hybrid framework for distantly supervised relation extraction that combines trained DSRE models with LLM in-context learning, using dynamic exemplar retrieval to handle noisy annotations and achieving significant performance gains in both English and low-resource Indic languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DSRE models face challenges with noisy bag-level annotations and their integration with LLM in-context learning is underexplored. LLMs may not learn relation semantics correctly due to annotation noise.

Method: HYDRE first uses a trained DSRE model to identify top-k candidate relations, then employs a novel dynamic exemplar retrieval strategy to extract reliable sentence-level exemplars from training data, which are provided in LLM prompts for final relation prediction.

Result: HYDRE achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and average 17 F1 points improvement on four Indic languages (Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, Tulu) over prior state-of-the-art DSRE models.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining DSRE models with LLM in-context learning through dynamic exemplar retrieval effectively addresses noisy annotation challenges and demonstrates strong performance across both English and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing
challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations
while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)
DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context
learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key
challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to
noisy annotation.
  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation
Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k
candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic
exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars
from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the
final relation(s).
  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource
languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods
on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse
low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE
achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on
Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's
efficacy compared to other prompting strategies.

TL;DR: KrishokBondhu is a voice-enabled agricultural advisory platform using RAG framework for Bengali-speaking farmers, achieving 44.7% improvement over benchmarks with high-quality responses for 72.7% of queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges faced by Bangladeshi farmers in accessing timely, expert-level agricultural guidance through accessible technology solutions.

Method: Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with OCR/document parsing, vector database indexing, speech-to-text conversion, and text-to-speech delivery in Bengali using Gemma 3-4B model.

Result: 72.7% high-quality responses for diverse agricultural queries, 44.7% improvement over KisanQRS benchmark (4.53 vs 3.13), with significant gains in contextual richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%).

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of integrating call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and RAG techniques to deliver expert agricultural guidance to remote farmers, paving way for AI-driven advisory ecosystem.

Abstract: In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely,
expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a
voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for
Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural
handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the
content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic
retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system
to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali
query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma
3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the
answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced
high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop
management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the
KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on
a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual
richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable
relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further
revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,
emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated
documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG
techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi
farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory
ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate factuality in LLMs specifically for Korean cultural knowledge, creating a challenging yet easily gradable benchmark that differs from English counterparts.

Method: Developed 1,000 short fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers about Korean culture, then evaluated diverse open-source LLMs supporting Korean.

Result: Even the strongest model achieved only 33.7% accuracy, and performance rankings differed substantially from English SimpleQA. Reasoning capabilities helped models elicit latent knowledge and improve abstention when uncertain.

Conclusion: KoSimpleQA provides a valuable benchmark for Korean cultural knowledge evaluation in LLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and highlighting the importance of language-specific cultural knowledge assessment.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA)}$, a benchmark for
evaluating factuality in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on Korean
cultural knowledge. KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade,
consisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of
varying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model
generates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging
nature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ
substantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value
of our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging
reasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better
elicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when
uncertain. KoSimpleQA can be found at

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness gaps in English ASR systems for second-language speakers by proposing fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, achieving significant improvements in word error rate across accent groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address large fairness gaps in ASR systems for second-language speakers, as analysis revealed significant word error rate fluctuations across 26 accent groups in widely used models like Whisper and Seamless-M4T.

Method: Proposed fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), fusing traditional empirical risk minimization with fairness-driven objectives.

Result: Achieved relative improvements of 58.7% and 58.5% in macro-averaged word error rate over pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and 7.8% improvements over standard empirical risk minimization finetuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances fairness across accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy in ASR systems for second-language speakers.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of building fair English ASR systems
for second-language speakers. Our analysis of widely used ASR models, Whisper
and Seamless-M4T, reveals large fluctuations in word error rate (WER) across 26
accent groups, indicating significant fairness gaps. To mitigate this, we
propose fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating
Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization
(Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Our proposed fusion of
traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and
fairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across
accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of
macro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of
58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and
7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with
cross-entropy loss.

*ChangSu Choi,Hoyun Song,Dongyeon Kim,WooHyeon Jung,Minkyung Cho,Sunjin Park,NohHyeob Bae,Seona Yu,KyungTae Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENTOR is a framework that combines reinforcement learning with teacher-guided distillation to improve tool-using capabilities in small language models, addressing poor generalization in SFT and inefficient exploration in standard RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) suffer from poor generalization by imitating static teacher trajectories, while standard RL with sparse rewards struggles with inefficient exploration and suboptimal strategies in small language models.

Method: MENTOR synergistically combines RL with teacher-guided distillation, using an RL-based process for generalizable policy learning and constructing dense composite teacher-guided rewards from reference trajectories to provide fine-grained guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show MENTOR significantly improves cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL baselines.

Conclusion: MENTOR effectively addresses the limitations of both SFT and standard RL by combining reinforcement learning with teacher-guided distillation, enabling more robust tool-using capabilities in small language models.

Abstract: Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into
smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for
their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static
set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While
reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse
rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with
inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these
distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically
combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,
MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through
exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a
teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided
reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and
strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL
baselines.

*Siyuan Yan,Guo-Qing Jiang,Yuchen Zhang,Xiaoxing Ma,Ran Zhu,Chun Cao,Jingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adamas is a sparse attention mechanism that uses Hadamard transform, bucketization, and 2-bit compression to achieve efficient long-context inference while maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models with extended context windows face quadratic self-attention costs, leading to latency issues. Existing sparse attention methods suffer from accuracy degradation due to heuristic patterns that fail to recall critical key-value pairs.

Method: Adamas applies Hadamard transform, bucketization and 2-bit compression to create compact representations, then uses Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selection of key-value pairs.

Result: Adamas matches full attention accuracy with only 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128 tokens, supports 8x higher sparsity than SOTA methods, and delivers up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences.

Conclusion: Adamas effectively maintains accuracy under aggressive sparsity, achieving comparable or even lower perplexity than full attention while significantly improving computational efficiency for long-context inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of
thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document
summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering
and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate
the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in
autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these
costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value
(KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce
Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed
for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform,
bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and
leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections.
Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a
64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to
8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering
up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences.
Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full
attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under
aggressive sparsity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has limitations for open-domain tasks with unclear reasoning steps, so the authors propose Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT) where LLMs first tag concepts then generate content, showing superior performance in conversational tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) performs poorly in open-domain tasks due to the lack of clearly defined reasoning steps and logical transitions, requiring a new approach for such scenarios.

Method: Propose Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT) paradigm where LLM first tags concepts (emotions, strategies, topics) then generates detailed content, allowing concept chains within utterances to encourage deep thinking.

Result: CoCT outperforms baselines including Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG in daily and emotional support conversations across automatic, human and model evaluations.

Conclusion: CoCT represents a potentially effective prompt-based paradigm for LLMs that can be applied to a wider scope of tasks beyond traditional reasoning domains.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to improve the LLM capability in
math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for
open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical
transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based
paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a
concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed
within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We
experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations
where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic,
human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as
Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective
prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider scope of tasks.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Koel Dutta Chowdury,Yusser Al-Ghussin,Shakib Yazdani,Cennet Oguz,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a token-level reliability measure to detect hallucinations in sign language translation by quantifying visual grounding through feature sensitivity and counterfactual signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination is a critical flaw in vision-language models, especially in sign language translation where meaning depends on precise visual grounding. Gloss-free models are particularly vulnerable as they map signer movements directly to language without intermediate alignment.

Method: Combines feature-based sensitivity (measuring internal changes when video is masked) with counterfactual signals (capturing probability differences between clean and altered video inputs) to create token-level and sentence-level reliability scores.

Result: Reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across datasets and architectures, decreases under visual degradations, distinguishes grounded from guessed tokens, and improves risk estimation when combined with text-based signals.

Conclusion: Establishes reliability as a practical tool for diagnosing hallucinations in SLT and lays groundwork for more robust hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

Abstract: Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual
evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly
critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise
grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because
they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without
intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that
hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual
input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that
quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines
feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is
masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences
between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a
sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure
of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks
(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our
results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across
datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond
these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded
tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when
combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it
further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights
why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,
our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for
diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust
hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

*Atharvan Dogra,Soumya Suvra Ghosal,Ameet Deshpande,Ashwin Kalyan,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM humor optimization amplifies harmful content, with toxic/stereotypical jokes receiving higher humor scores and appearing more frequently in funny outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how funniness optimization in LLM pipelines couples with harmful content like stereotypes and toxicity.

Method: Joint measurement of humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity across six models; information-theoretic analysis of incongruity signals; external validation with satire-generation task and human judgments.

Result: Harmful outputs receive higher humor scores (10-21% increase), with amplification under role-based prompting; harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty; stereotypical/toxic jokes appear 11-28% more often in LLM-marked funny outputs and up to 10% more in human-perceived funny generations.

Conclusion: LLM humor generation exhibits bias amplification loop between generators and evaluators, with harmful content structurally embedded in learned humor distributions.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for creative writing and
engagement content, raising safety concerns about the outputs. Therefore,
casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness
optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly
measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented
by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across
six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which
further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification
loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show
harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make
harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural
embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional
satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM
satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed
models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\%$ in mean humor
score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\%$ to $28\%$ more often among the jokes
marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\%$ more often in generations
perceived as funny by humans.

TL;DR: ChronoPlay is a framework for automated generation of dynamic RAG benchmarks in gaming, addressing dual dynamics of game updates and player focus shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of dedicated benchmarks for RAG systems in dynamic domains like online gaming, particularly due to dual dynamics of game content updates and shifting player community focus.

Method: Uses dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both game updates and player focus changes, and dual-source synthesis engine drawing from official sources and player community.

Result: Created first dynamic RAG benchmark for gaming domain on three distinct games, providing insights into model performance under realistic conditions.

Conclusion: ChronoPlay successfully addresses the integrated challenge of dynamic gaming environments and enables standardized evaluation of RAG systems in this domain.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in
dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has
impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual
Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting
focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a
benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to
ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge,
we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous
generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update
mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine
that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual
correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three
distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain,
offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic
conditions. Code is avaliable at: https://github.com/hly1998/ChronoPlay.

Motivation: To address the central challenge of attributing Transformer model behavior to internal computations without requiring auxiliary training, enabling faithful and fine-grained attribution.

Method: Decomposes hidden states into customized additive components and propagates them through the model with fixed attention scores and MLP activations in a single forward pass.

Result: Validated across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level attribution tasks, demonstrating effectiveness and fidelity in attributing information flow between arbitrary Transformer components.

Conclusion: DePass serves as a foundational tool for broader interpretability applications, providing faithful attribution without auxiliary training requirements.

Abstract: Attributing the behavior of Transformer models to internal computations is a
central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce DePass, a
unified framework for feature attribution based on a single decomposed forward
pass. DePass decomposes hidden states into customized additive components, then
propagates them with attention scores and MLP's activations fixed. It achieves
faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We
validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level
attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. Our
experiments highlight its potential to attribute information flow between
arbitrary components of a Transformer model. We hope DePass serves as a
foundational tool for broader applications in interpretability.

Motivation: WordNet's fine-grained sense distinctions are challenging for second-language learners, so integrating CEFR language-proficiency levels can bridge NLP and language education.

Method: Automated CEFR annotation using large language model to measure semantic similarity between WordNet sense definitions and English Vocabulary Profile Online entries, then validated with corpus-based contextual lexical classifiers.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the corpus perform comparably to gold-standard annotations, and combining both achieves Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating high annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: The CEFR-annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to facilitate more effective language learning by bridging NLP and language education.

Abstract: Although WordNet is a valuable resource owing to its structured semantic
networks and extensive vocabulary, its fine-grained sense distinctions can be
challenging for second-language learners. To address this, we developed a
WordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We
automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic
similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English
Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale
corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated
WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those
trained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with
the gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a
Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations. Our
annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to help
bridge the gap between natural language processing and language education,
thereby facilitating more effective and efficient language learning.

### [44] [IMB: An Italian Medical Benchmark for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18468)
*Antonio Romano,Giuseppe Riccio,Mariano Barone,Marco Postiglione,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Created two Italian medical benchmarks (IMB-QA and IMB-MCQA) for evaluating medical question answering systems, showing that domain-specific adaptation and retrieval strategies outperform larger general-purpose LLMs in medical QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online medical forums contain valuable healthcare knowledge but pose challenges for automated QA systems due to informal language and linguistic complexity, especially for non-English languages like Italian.

Method: Developed two Italian medical datasets: IMB-QA (782,644 patient-doctor conversations) and IMB-MCQA (25,862 multiple-choice questions). Used LLMs to improve data clarity while preserving meaning, and evaluated various LLM architectures with RAG and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Specialized adaptation strategies outperformed larger general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks, demonstrating that domain expertise and efficient information retrieval are more beneficial than increased model scale.

Conclusion: Effective medical AI systems benefit more from domain expertise and information retrieval than model scale. The datasets and frameworks are released to support multilingual medical QA research.

Abstract: Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek
professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge.
However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions
pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems,
especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two
comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644
patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA},
comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty
examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged
to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining
their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM
architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our
experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific
fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform
larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These
findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain
expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale.
We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to
support further research on multilingual medical question answering:

### [45] [DART: A Structured Dataset of Regulatory Drug Documents in Italian for Clinical NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18475)
*Mariano Barone,Antonio Laudante,Giuseppe Riccio,Antonio Romano,Marco Postiglione,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART is the first structured corpus of Italian drug regulatory documents, created through automated processing of official Italian Medicines Agency documents to support pharmacological NLP tasks in non-English languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most pharmacological NLP research relies on English corpora like DrugBank, creating a gap for other healthcare systems. There's a need for resources tailored to specific national regulatory frameworks like Italy's.

Method: Built through a reproducible pipeline: web-scale document retrieval from AIFA, semantic segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using few-shot-tuned LLM with low-temperature decoding.

Result: DART provides structured information on key pharmacological domains. Experimental validation shows instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer drug interactions and clinical implications when grounded in DART's structured data.

Conclusion: DART successfully addresses the gap in non-English pharmacological resources and demonstrates practical utility through an LLM-based drug interaction checker, enabling better clinical decision support for Italian healthcare.

Abstract: The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has
become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications
ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support.
However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language
corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to
other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug
Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian
Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of
the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a
reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic
segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a
few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART
provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as
indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate
its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that
leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental
results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential
interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured
textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub:

*Han Peng,Peiyu Liu,Zican Dong,Daixuan Cheng,Junyi Li,Yiru Tang,Shuo Wang,Wayne Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) underperform autoregressive models in speed despite their parallel decoding potential, due to issues in evaluation methods and limited benefits from current acceleration techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs offer parallel decoding for efficiency but current open-source implementations are slower than AR models, limiting practical utility. This study aims to systematically analyze DLM efficiency issues.

Method: Systematic study using empirical benchmarking and roofline-based theoretical analysis to compare DLM and AR model efficiency, plus investigation of acceleration strategies like dual cache and parallel decoding.

Result: AR models achieve higher throughput than DLMs, and acceleration techniques mainly benefit small batch sizes with diminishing returns when scaled.

Conclusion: Robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies are necessary to advance DLM research and realize their efficiency potential.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable
decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current
open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting
their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM
efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through
empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs
consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that
techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small
batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration
strategies to advance research on DLMs.

### [47] [Identity-Aware Large Language Models require Cultural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18510)
*Alistair Plum,Anne-Marie Lutgen,Christoph Purschke,Achim Rettinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLMs lack cultural reasoning - the ability to recognize culture-specific knowledge and adjust outputs to align with diverse user expectations. This gap leads to Western bias, stereotypes, and reduced trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often reflect narrow cultural viewpoints that overlook global diversity, sustaining stereotypes, ignoring minority perspectives, eroding trust, and perpetuating hate. Current models default to Western norms in moral judgments, idiom interpretation, and advice.

Method: The paper defines cultural reasoning as a foundational capability and outlines initial directions for assessment, arguing it should be treated alongside factual accuracy and linguistic coherence.

Result: Recent studies show current models default to Western norms, and fine-tuning on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. Existing evaluation methods fail to capture adaptive reasoning in context.

Conclusion: Cultural reasoning must be treated as a foundational capability. By clarifying the concept and outlining assessment directions, future systems can respond with greater sensitivity to human cultural diversity.

Abstract: Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language
processing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,
their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the
diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as
cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to
recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its
output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because
culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,
cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is
limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority
perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies
strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging
moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning
on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation
methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive
reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone
ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning
must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and
linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial
directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be
able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human
culture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an urgent need to understand how training data characteristics influence bias in healthcare AI models, as current practices lack transparency in dataset curation and bias assessment.

Method: The study presents an in-depth analysis of downstream biases in clinical language models, focusing on demographic disparities in opioid prescriptions, and introduces HC4 - a novel 89+ billion token healthcare pretraining dataset.

Result: The evaluation uses both established general benchmarks and a novel healthcare-specific methodology to provide insights into model fairness and bias patterns.

Conclusion: The research aims to support fairness and safety in clinical AI applications through comprehensive bias evaluation and improved dataset curation practices.

Abstract: Large language models offer transformative potential for healthcare, yet
their responsible and equitable development depends critically on a deeper
understanding of how training data characteristics influence model behavior,
including the potential for bias. Current practices in dataset curation and
bias assessment often lack the necessary transparency, creating an urgent need
for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to foster trust and guide improvements.
In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of potential downstream biases
in clinical language models, with a focus on differential opioid prescription
tendencies across diverse demographic groups, such as ethnicity, gender, and
age. As part of this investigation, we introduce HC4: Healthcare Comprehensive
Commons Corpus, a novel and extensively curated pretraining dataset exceeding
89 billion tokens. Our evaluation leverages both established general benchmarks
and a novel, healthcare-specific methodology, offering crucial insights to
support fairness and safety in clinical AI applications.

*Dennis Assenmacher,Paloma Piot,Katarina Laken,David Jurgens,Claudia Wagner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the overlooked issue of digital dehumanization in NLP, focusing on subtle forms beyond overtly negative statements, and creates a bilingual dataset for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses only on overt dehumanization, missing subtler forms that perpetuate harmful biases against marginalized groups in online interactions.

Method: Used different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from Twitter and Reddit, annotated 16,000 instances by crowdworkers and experts at document- and span-level.

Result: Fine-tuned ML models on the dataset achieved performance surpassing state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as both training resource and benchmark for dehumanization detection, addressing the broader spectrum of dehumanization beyond overt forms.

Abstract: Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked
within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single
aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its
core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online
communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization.
Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite
not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against
marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously
reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness,
making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use
different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from
Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances
on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different
dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource
for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future
dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses
state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

*Sam Kirkham,Patrycja Strycharczuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ultrasound tongue kinematics can reliably estimate dynamical parameters comparable to EMA data for articulatory models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if ultrasound imaging can serve as a reliable alternative to EMA for estimating parameters in dynamical articulatory models of speech.

Method: Compare parameters of a linear harmonic oscillator estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics with those from simultaneously-recorded EMA data, including mandibular short tendon tracking for jaw motion.

Result: Ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, and mandibular short tendon tracking adequately captures jaw motion.

Conclusion: Ultrasound kinematics can be effectively used to evaluate dynamical articulatory models, providing a promising alternative to EMA.

Abstract: The control of speech can be modelled as a dynamical system in which
articulators are driven toward target positions. These models are typically
evaluated using fleshpoint data, such as electromagnetic articulography (EMA),
but recent methodological advances make ultrasound imaging a promising
alternative. We evaluate whether the parameters of a linear harmonic oscillator
can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics and compare these
with parameters estimated from simultaneously-recorded EMA data. We find that
ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, while mandibular
short tendon tracking also adequately captures jaw motion. This supports using
ultrasound kinematics to evaluate dynamical articulatory models.

Motivation: To investigate LLM capabilities in long-context medical question answering of clinical relevance, which has not been previously studied comprehensively.

Method: Comprehensive assessment across various content-inclusion settings, LLM models of varying capabilities, datasets across task formulations, with examination of RAG effects and multi-faceted evaluation approach including qualitative and error analysis.

Result: Revealed insights on model size effects, limitations, underlying memorization issues, benefits of reasoning models, and uncovered best settings for single versus multi-document reasoning. Showcased RAG strategies for improvements over long-context comprehension.

Conclusion: The study addresses open questions on when RAG is beneficial over long-context approaches and reveals common failure cases in medical QA comprehension.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation models enable effective adaptation to code-switching domains while minimizing catastrophic forgetting, achieving 54% backward gain with only 4% performance drop on new domain compared to LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large speech foundation models need adaptation for local needs like code-switching, but direct fine-tuning risks overfitting and overwriting the base model's broad capabilities.

Method: Bayesian factorized adapters with priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices, applied to Whisper model for multilingual code-switching scenarios.

Result: Minimal adaptation loss while significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting - achieves 54% backward gain with only 4% drop on new domain compared to LoRA.

Conclusion: Bayesian adaptation is effective for fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization, maintaining broad capabilities while adapting to specific domains.

Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many
domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as
code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct
fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and
overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this
challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation
models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and
thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply
our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual
code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while
significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to
LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new
domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for
fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.

*Enes Yavuz Ugan,Ngoc-Quan Pham,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses poor performance of large models on code-switching tasks by introducing a differentiable surrogate that highlights code-switching points to reduce context bias and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundational models struggle with code-switching test cases despite good performance on standard benchmarks, due to infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments where embeddings of second languages appear subtly.

Method: Leverage the difference between embedded and main language to highlight code-switching points, using a simple yet effective differentiable surrogate that emphasizes learning at those locations to mitigate context bias during generation.

Result: Experiments with Arabic and Chinese-English showed models predict switching places more correctly, reflected by reduced substitution error.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates context bias in code-switching scenarios, improving model robustness and performance on code-switching tasks.

Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large
foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data
scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the
reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the
embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the
models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to
provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on
code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points
where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis
emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,
we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to
highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those
locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context
bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby
improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and
Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places
more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.

*Josh McGiff,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA are semi-supervised inference-efficient methods that improve neural machine translation for low-resource languages like Irish, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning to match or exceed full-model fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of fine-tuning large multilingual models for low-resource domains like Irish translation, making high-quality domain adaptation more accessible.

Method: Introduces SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain adaptation through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using small trainable adapter layers.

Result: SemiAdapt outperforms full-domain fine-tuning, and SemiLoRA enables PEFT methods to match or outperform full-model fine-tuning, especially effective on larger and noisier corpora.

Conclusion: These methods make high-quality domain adaptation more accessible for low-resource language research, with all Irish translation models released as open resources.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks
such as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning
is computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with
billions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers
working on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original
model parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing
small, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as
semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain
adaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that
SemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA
can propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We
further evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our
embedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier
corpora. All Irish translation models developed in this work are released as
open resources. These methods aim to make high-quality domain adaptation and
fine-tuning more accessible to researchers working with low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLAAR is a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that addresses Lost-in-Conversation (LiC) in multi-turn dialogues by teaching models to balance correct answering with informed abstention, significantly reducing performance decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models show strong single-turn instruction following but suffer from performance degradation (Lost-in-Conversation) when information is revealed progressively in multi-turn conversations.

Method: Uses curriculum reinforcement learning with verifiable accuracy and abstention rewards, employing competence-gated curriculum to incrementally increase dialogue difficulty, multi-turn on-policy rollouts, and mixed-reward system.

Result: Significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%) on LiC benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and trustworthy LLMs by teaching models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn
instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation
in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings.
Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not
only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of
questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a
competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty
(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting
reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,
RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,
reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC
benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to
75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together,
these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and
trustworthy LLMs.

*Taha Binhuraib,Greta Tuckute,Nicholas Blauch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Topoformers - Transformers with topographic organization through spatial querying and spatial reweighting, which organizes representations spatially like biological brains while maintaining performance and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological brains exhibit spatial functional organization where neurons are arranged topographically, while standard machine learning models lack spatial biases and have disorganized vector spaces that are hard to interpret.

Method: Proposed spatial querying (arranging keys and queries on 2D grids with local query pools) and spatial reweighting (converting fully connected self-attention to locally connected layers) to create Topoformers with topographic organization.

Result: Topoformers perform on par with non-topographic controls on NLP benchmarks while producing interpretable topographic organization across eight linguistic test suites, and show alignment with human brain language network in fMRI data.

Conclusion: Topoformers enable interpretable topographic organization in Transformers, bridging machine learning with brain-like spatial organization and holding promise for better NLP interpretability and more accurate models of human brain language processing.

Abstract: Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons
are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at
multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning
models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces
that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of
self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic
organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are
arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given
key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected
layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate
the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment
classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic
organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately
encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.
We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with
a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant
performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet
produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight
linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain
responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment
between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and
human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for
greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the
organization of linguistic information in the human brain.

TL;DR: Approximately 9% of newspaper articles are AI-generated, with uneven distribution across outlets, topics, and ownership groups. Opinion pieces are 6.4x more likely to contain AI content than news articles, yet AI use is rarely disclosed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear extent of AI use in published newspaper articles and understand its prevalence and distribution across different types of journalism.

Method: Audited 186K articles from 1.5K American newspapers using Pangram AI detector, analyzed 45K opinion pieces from major publications, and conducted manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles.

Result: 9% of newly-published articles are AI-generated, with higher prevalence in smaller local outlets, weather/technology topics, and certain ownership groups. Opinion pieces show 6.4x higher AI use than news articles, with only 5% disclosure rate in AI-flagged content.

Conclusion: There is an immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards regarding AI use in journalism to maintain public trust.

Abstract: AI is rapidly transforming journalism, but the extent of its use in published
newspaper articles remains unclear. We address this gap by auditing a
large-scale dataset of 186K articles from online editions of 1.5K American
newspapers published in the summer of 2025. Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art
AI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are
either partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed,
appearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as
weather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze
45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street
Journal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated
content than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged
op-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find
that AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles
found only five disclosures of AI use. Overall, our audit highlights the
immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards
regarding the use of AI in journalism to maintain public trust.

TL;DR: KAT-Coder is a large-scale agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum (Mid-Term Training, SFT, RFT, and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation) to bridge the gap between static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution in coding workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a core challenge in agentic coding, where models need to autonomously reason, plan, and act within interactive software development workflows.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum training: 1) Mid-Term Training enhances reasoning, planning, and reflection using real software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions; 2) SFT constructs a million-sample dataset balancing programming languages, development contexts, and task archetypes; 3) RFT introduces multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable policy optimization; 4) Reinforcement-to-Deployment adapts to production IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured Trajectory Training.

Result: KAT-Coder achieves robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning, forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents. The 32B model KAT-Dev has been open-sourced.

Conclusion: The multi-stage training curriculum enables KAT-Coder to effectively bridge the gap between static training and dynamic agentic execution, creating a foundation for deployable intelligent coding agents in real-world software development environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in
agentic coding, where models autonomously reason, plan, and act within
interactive software development workflows. However, bridging the gap between
static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a
core challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale
agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing
Mid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances
reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real
software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage
constructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten
development contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel
multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy
optimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model
to production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured
Trajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve
robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning,
forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents. Our
KAT series 32B model, KAT-Dev, has been open-sourced on

TL;DR: WebSeer is a search agent trained with reinforcement learning and self-reflection that achieves state-of-the-art performance on QA benchmarks by enabling longer, more accurate tool-use trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search agents using reinforcement learning suffer from shallow tool-use depth and error accumulation over multiple interactions, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic retrieval scenarios.

Method: A two-stage training framework combining cold start and reinforcement learning within a self-reflection paradigm, using a large dataset annotated with reflection patterns for real-world web environments.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA (72.3%) and SimpleQA (90.0%) using a single 14B model, with strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets.

Conclusion: The self-reflection mechanism enables longer tool-use chains and improves answer accuracy, making WebSeer a more intelligent and effective search agent for complex information retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent
information retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments.
Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models
capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by
shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative
interactions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search
agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection
mechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection
patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and
reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world
web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more
reflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use
chains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and
90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-distribution datasets. The code is available at

*Shuxin Lin,Dhaval Patel,Christodoulos Constantinides*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A knowledge distillation framework transfers Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models to Small Language Models for industrial asset health applications, enabling efficient domain-specific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models are popular in industrial applications due to efficiency and cost-effectiveness, but they struggle with complex reasoning tasks in specialized fields like Industry 4.0.

Method: Proposes a knowledge distillation framework using Chain-of-Thought distillation from LLMs to SLMs via multi-choice question answering prompts, with in-context learning to verify knowledge quality.

Result: Fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning significantly outperform base models and narrow the performance gap with their LLM counterparts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances reasoning capabilities of SLMs through knowledge distillation, making them more viable for complex industrial applications while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized
fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower
computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific
tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing
complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains
challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for
industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to
smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the
process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts
to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context
learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the
performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used
LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform
the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM
counterparts. Our code is open-sourced at:

*Wenxuan Li,Chengruidong Zhang,Huiqiang Jiang,Yucheng Li,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTraining is a distributed training method that uses dynamic sparse attention to efficiently train LLMs with ultra-long contexts, achieving 6x higher throughput while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic sparse attention reduces computational costs for long-context LLMs, but distributed training faces challenges with worker- and step-level imbalance that limit efficiency.

Method: MTraining integrates three components: dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention to address computational imbalance and communication overhead.

Result: Successfully trained Qwen2.5-3B from 32K to 512K context window on 32 A100 GPUs, achieving up to 6x higher training throughput while preserving accuracy on benchmarks like RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A Haystack.

Conclusion: MTraining enables efficient distributed training of LLMs with ultra-long contexts using dynamic sparse attention, overcoming previous limitations in computational balance and communication efficiency.

Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large
Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their
capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse
scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the
computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with
dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed
settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and
step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed
methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training
for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key
components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,
and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to
synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads
inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models
with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by
training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K
tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite
of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A
Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput
while preserving model accuracy. Our code is available at

*Chenghao Zhu,Meiling Tao,Tiannan Wang,Dongyi Ding,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Critique-Post-Edit framework improves LLM personalization using multi-dimensional reward models and self-revision to prevent reward hacking and achieve better performance than standard RLHF methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLHF struggles with personalization nuances and suffers from reward hacking, leading to verbose and superficially personalized responses. SFT also reaches performance plateaus quickly.

Method: Proposes Critique-Post-Edit framework with: (1) Personalized Generative Reward Model providing multi-dimensional scores and textual critiques, (2) Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where policy model revises outputs based on critiques.

Result: Substantially outperforms standard PPO on personalization benchmarks under length-controlled evaluation. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves 11% average win-rate improvement, and Qwen2.5-14B surpasses GPT-4 performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical path to faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization of LLMs that resists reward hacking and provides more targeted learning.

Abstract: Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the
nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward
hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To
address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust
reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable
personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a
Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional
scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a
Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs
based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a
rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms
standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an
average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses
the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to
faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

TL;DR: Ring-1T is the first open-source trillion-parameter thinking model with 1T total parameters and 50B activated per token, achieving state-of-the-art results on reasoning benchmarks including IMO-2025 silver medal level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize large-scale reasoning intelligence by creating the first open-source trillion-parameter thinking model and address unprecedented training challenges at this scale.

Method: Three innovations: IcePop for RL training stability via token-level discrepancy masking/clipping, C3PO++ for efficient long rollout processing under token budget, and ASystem RL framework to overcome systemic bottlenecks.

Result: Breakthrough performance: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1, and silver medal-level result on IMO-2025.

Conclusion: Ring-1T establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance and marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence.

Abstract: We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model
with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and
activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a
trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including
train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and
bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected
innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy
masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;
(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget
by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and
(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic
bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers
breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on
HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a
silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional
reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the
community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge
reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in
democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline
for open-source model performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightMem is a novel memory system for LLMs that organizes memory into three stages inspired by human memory models, achieving significant performance gains while dramatically reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems for LLMs introduce substantial time and computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment in dynamic environments.

Method: LightMem organizes memory into three stages: cognition-inspired sensory memory for rapid filtering and topic grouping, topic-aware short-term memory for content organization and summarization, and long-term memory with sleep-time update for offline consolidation.

Result: Experiments show LightMem outperforms baselines by up to 10.9% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 117x, API calls by 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

Conclusion: LightMem effectively balances performance and efficiency in memory systems for LLMs, enabling more practical deployment in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle
to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and
complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless
interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and
utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce
substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new
memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance
and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of
human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,
cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information
through lightweight compression and groups information according to their
topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based
groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,
long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that
decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with
GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in
accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API
calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at

### [67] [How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18871)
*Akshat Gupta,Jay Yeung,Gopala Anumanchipalli,Anna Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs use depth in a structured "Guess-then-Refine" pattern where early layers make high-frequency token guesses that get refined into contextually appropriate tokens in later layers, with different computational depth requirements for different linguistic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fine-grained layer-wise prediction dynamics of large language models and how they use their computational depth during inference, as current evidence suggests non-uniform depth usage.

Method: Tracing intermediate representations of open-weight models during inference, analyzing token frequency patterns, and conducting three case studies: part-of-speech analysis, fact recall tasks, and multiple-choice tasks.

Result: Early layers predict high-frequency tokens as statistical guesses (refined >70% of the time), function words are predicted earliest, first tokens in multi-token answers require more depth, and response format is identified early but finalized late.

Conclusion: LLMs employ a structured depth usage pattern with early guessing and later refinement, providing insights for improving computational efficiency in transformer models.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth
uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise
prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations
of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and
nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework
that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make
predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers
are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical
guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate
contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the
model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.
Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the
time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then
go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer
depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that
function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)
Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token
requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task
analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the
first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.
Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding
light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions
and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in
transformer-based models.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Agent is a multi-agent framework that dynamically optimizes training parameters using bandit algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-label image classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-label image classification methods use static configurations that fail in dynamic settings, requiring adaptive training strategies for complex visual-semantic landscapes.

Method: Uses autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions via non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms, with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training.

Result: Achieved mAP of 97.4 on Pascal VOC (vs 96.2 for PAT-T), 92.8 on COCO (vs 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), and 60.9 on VG-256, with superior OF1 and CF1 scores across all datasets.

Conclusion: MAT-Agent provides scalable, intelligent optimization for complex visual models with accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, advancing adaptive deep learning.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO is a dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity for efficient instruction tuning of MLLMs, achieving 98.2% of full-data performance using only 20% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of training MLLMs on large-scale datasets and overcome limitations of existing data selection methods that have high overhead and suboptimal selection.

Method: Uses a lightweight plug-in scorer trained on a small random sample to learn candidate set distribution, employing homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation to balance importance and diversity.

Result: Achieved 98.2% of full-data fine-tuning performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks using only 20% of selected data.

Conclusion: CoIDO provides an efficient and scalable data selection method that significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining near-full performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Early prediction of glioblastoma treatment response using a latent diffusion model that generates post-treatment MRI from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization, with classifier-free guidance using survival information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastoma patients show highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses that take months to observe via MRI. Early prediction of treatment response is crucial for personalized medicine, but most approaches rely on time-series data rather than early visual prediction.

Method: Proposed a Latent Diffusion Model with concatenation-based conditioning from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization, using classifier-free guidance with survival information to enhance generation quality and reflect post-treatment tumor evolution.

Result: Model was trained and tested on a local dataset of 140 GBM patients with pre/post T1-Gd MRI, manually delineated tumor localization, and survival information collected at Centre François Baclesse.

Conclusion: The approach enables early visual treatment response prediction through slice-to-slice translation modeling, generating post-treatment MRI from pre-treatment data to capture tumor evolution before traditional observation methods.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,

*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An embedding-based AI image detection framework that uses image embeddings and vector similarity to distinguish AI-generated images from human-created ones, demonstrating robustness against perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI and LLMs has enabled creation of highly realistic digital content that is often indistinguishable from human-created images, posing challenges for digital content authentication and trust in digital media.

Method: Utilizes image embeddings and vector similarity, processing diverse datasets through five benchmark embedding models. Based on hypothesis that AI-generated images show closer embedding proximity to other AI content while human-created images cluster in their own domain.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows robustness with moderate to high perturbations minimally impacting embedding signatures. Perturbed images maintain close similarity matches to their original versions.

Conclusion: Provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that balances accuracy with computational efficiency, offering a solution for digital content authentication.

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMIS-Net is a novel framework for backchannel agreement detection that addresses individual differences through multi-scale feature normalization and implicit data augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backchannels are crucial for human-like AI interactions but are heavily influenced by individual differences across multiple scales (frame-level intensity and sequence-level patterns), which existing emotion recognition methods fail to fully address due to their single-scale approaches.

Method: Proposed Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized features by removing person-specific neutral baselines at both frame and sequence levels, plus an implicit data augmentation module to handle training data distributional bias.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show CMIS-Net effectively handles individual differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection.

Conclusion: The multi-scale individual standardization approach successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by focusing on relative changes from individual baselines rather than absolute expression values, enabling more robust backchannel detection.

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ultra-efficient post-training method that shortcuts large flow matching diffusion models into few-step samplers using velocity field self-distillation, eliminating the need for step-size embedding and enabling efficient few-shot distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shortcutting methods require specialized step-size embedding and retraining from scratch, which is nearly as costly as pretraining itself. The goal is to enable flexible trajectory-skipping capabilities in standard flow matching models without this expensive requirement.

Method: Uses velocity field self-distillation that works on the velocity field rather than sample space, learning rapidly from self-guided distillation in an online manner. The approach can also be incorporated into pretraining to yield models that inherently learn efficient few-step flows.

Result: The method trains efficiently (e.g., producing a 3-step Flux model in less than one A100 day) and enables few-shot distillation (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient way to convert large pre-trained flow matching models into few-step samplers without expensive retraining, while also enabling integration into pretraining for inherently efficient models and achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

TL;DR: A hybrid computer vision approach creates pseudo-IMU data from 3D joint keypoints to monitor scuba diver safety, overcoming underwater wireless limitations and detecting medical emergencies like cardiac arrest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional activity recognition methods fail in underwater environments due to wireless signal attenuation, creating safety risks for scuba divers who face medical emergencies like cardiac arrest.

Method: Uses computer vision to generate pseudo-IMU data from 3D human joint keypoints, circumventing underwater wireless limitations, and integrates this classifier onboard an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

Result: The system effectively identifies anomalous scuba diver behavior signaling medical emergencies through experiments with simulated distress scenarios.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach demonstrates utility for advancing robotic monitoring and improving scuba diver safety by enabling effective emergency detection in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align

challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive

TL;DR: MUSE is a training-free framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation that uses 3D object templates and 2D proposals with uncertainty-aware similarity matching, achieving SOTA on BOP Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation without requiring additional training or fine-tuning, leveraging 3D object knowledge for robust performance.

Method: Uses 2D multi-view templates from 3D objects and 2D proposals; integrates class and patch embeddings with GeM pooling; employs joint similarity metric combining absolute and relative scores; refines with uncertainty-aware object prior.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across Classic Core, H3, and Industrial tracks without any training.

Conclusion: MUSE provides a powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation that works effectively without training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scarcity of annotated data in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for handwritten historical scores by developing a GAN-based method to generate realistic synthetic musical scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of OMR lacks sufficient real annotated data, especially for handwritten historical musical scores, which limits the training of effective recognition systems.

Method: Implemented a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic handwritten-looking musical symbols, then assembled these into full scores using Smashcima engraving software.

Result: The generated symbols demonstrated high visual fidelity and realism, representing significant progress in synthetic score generation for OMR applications.

Conclusion: GAN-based synthetic score generation shows promise for overcoming data scarcity in OMR, particularly for handwritten historical musical documents.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic

*Tadesse K Bahiru,Natnael Tilahun Sinshaw,Teshager Hailemariam Moges,Dheeraj Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses gender classification bias by auditing datasets, revealing intersectional underrepresentation, and creating BalancedFace - a balanced dataset that reduces bias by 50%+ while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification systems amplify demographic imbalances from training data, leading to biased models that misclassify female faces more often and exhibit racial skew.

Method: Audited 5 gender classification datasets, trained identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on UTKFace and FairFace, then created BalancedFace by blending images from multiple sources to equalize subgroup shares across 189 demographic intersections using only real images.

Result: BalancedFace reduces maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and brings average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to ideal 1.0 compared to next-best dataset, with minimal overall accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Data-centric interventions like BalancedFace provide significant value for fair gender classification research, demonstrating that carefully engineered datasets can substantially reduce bias while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

*Xiaoxu Xu,Xuexun Liu,Jinlong Li,Yitian Yuan,Qiudan Zhang,Lin Ma,Nicu Sebe,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates geometric priors with class-aware guidance to generate high-quality pseudo labels through iterative refinement and self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous 3D WSSS methods that suffer from low-quality pseudo-labels and insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors, which create significant technical bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes a two-stage refinement approach: Class-Aware Label Refinement for balanced and accurate pseudo labels, followed by Geometry-Aware Label Refinement using 3D geometric constraints to filter low-confidence labels. Also includes Label Update strategy with Self-Training to propagate labels to unlabeled regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks with remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings, maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively integrates 3D geometric priors with class-aware guidance to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels, enabling development of high-performance 3D WSSS models through iterative refinement and self-training.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates fairness in deep learning segmentation models for nucleus accumbens in MRI images, finding performance disparities based on race and sex, with some models showing better accuracy when trained on race-matched data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about unfairness and performance disparities in medical image segmentation models based on sensitive attributes like race and sex, particularly for nucleus accumbens segmentation in MRI.

Method: Evaluated three segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net, CoTr) and atlas-based ANTs on a dataset with four demographic subgroups. Used manually labeled gold-standard segmentations, fairness metrics, and linear mixed models to analyze demographic effects on segmentation accuracy and volumes.

Result: Training on same race as test subjects improved segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT showed better performance with race-matched data, while nnU-Net was robust across demographics. Sex effects from manual segmentation persisted in biased models, but race effects disappeared in most models.

Conclusion: Deep learning segmentation models exhibit demographic biases, with race-matching improving performance for some algorithms. nnU-Net demonstrates demographic robustness, while manual segmentation sex effects are preserved but race effects are largely lost in automated methods.

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of

Method: Used TriggerNet framework with multiple explanation methods; trained on RGB images of 11 plant species; employed CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Random Forest, SVM, KNN; used Snorkel for automated disease class labeling (Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, Silk Webbing).

Result: Developed an interpretable AI system for plant classification and disease detection that reduces manual annotation time and improves dataset reliability.

Conclusion: TriggerNet provides an effective interpretable framework for early detection of red palm mite infestation, supporting better agricultural management decisions.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

*Ata Çelen,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HouseTour generates smooth 3D camera trajectories and natural language summaries from image collections using diffusion models constrained by camera poses, integrated with 3D Gaussian splatting for video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with geometric reasoning, creating a need for methods that can generate spatially-aware camera trajectories and descriptions for automated video creation in real estate and tourism applications.

Method: Uses diffusion process constrained by known camera poses to generate smooth trajectories, integrates this 3D information into VLM for grounded descriptions, and synthesizes videos using 3D Gaussian splatting. Introduces HouseTour dataset with 1,200 house-tour videos.

Result: Incorporating 3D camera trajectories improves text generation performance over independent task handling. Evaluated with individual and end-to-end metrics, including a new joint metric.

Conclusion: Enables automated professional-quality video creation for real estate and tourism without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

*Shivam Singh,Yiming Chen,Agneet Chatterjee,Amit Raj,James Hays,Yezhou Yang,Chitra Baral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chimera is a personalized image generation model that combines specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions without requiring user-specified masks or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generative models lack explicit control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user-specified masks or annotations.

Method: Built a dataset from 464 unique (part, subject) pairs (semantic atoms), generated 37k prompts, trained a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance to enforce semantic identity and spatial layout.

Result: Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality according to human evaluations and the proposed PartEval metric.

Conclusion: Chimera effectively addresses the limitation of existing models by enabling explicit control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images through textual instructions.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores using SEM imaging combined with YOLO-based machine learning for automated microplastic detection and quantification, focusing on filtration scenarios with patterned backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastics are widespread pollutants that are difficult to detect and analyze efficiently using traditional manual methods, especially in large screening studies.

Method: Combination of SEM imaging and YOLO-based machine learning object detection, focusing on filtration scenarios with symmetric and repetitive background patterns.

Result: Found differences in YOLO model performance for the task and identified the importance of optimizing preprocessing steps. Also revealed challenges with limited expert-labeled training data.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows potential for advancing microplastic detection but faces challenges including limited labeled data and the need for optimized preprocessing.

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT uses adaptive patch sizes in Vision Transformers to reduce input sequence length, achieving 40-50% speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ViTs use uniform patch sizes regardless of image content, leading to inefficient long input sequences for high-resolution images.

Method: APT allocates larger patch sizes in homogeneous areas and smaller patches in complex regions within the same image, reducing total input tokens.

Result: 40% speedup on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining performance; up to 30% faster training/inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: APT enables efficient ViT inference and training through adaptive patch allocation, achieving significant speedups without performance loss.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient 3D reconstruction from posed images but faces memory, lighting, and secondary-ray limitations. This tutorial overviews the 3DGS pipeline and explores solutions to these issues, plus applications in surface reconstruction, avatars, animation, and content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental transformation in 3D reconstruction driven by 3DGS advances, while tackling its key limitations including high memory footprint, baked lighting effects, and limited secondary-ray support.

Method: Provides a comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline starting from splatting formulation, then explores main efforts to address limitations through various technical approaches.

Result: A tutorial that systematically covers the 3DGS methodology and surveys applications leveraging its efficient rendering capabilities for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and content generation.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers efficient real-time rendering and seamless graphics pipeline integration, making it suitable for feed-forward pipelines despite current limitations, with ongoing research addressing its constraints across various application domains.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

*Zhiqi Kang,Rahaf Aljundi,Vaggelis Dorovatas,Karteek Alahari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes In-Context Distillation (ICD) - an online method where small vision-language models collaborate with stronger teacher models at inference time using sparse demonstrations to bridge performance gaps without costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying vision-language models in low-resource, budget-constrained settings where large models are impractical and small models require expensive fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance.

Method: Online In-Context Distillation with cross-modal demonstration selection, teacher test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to dynamically populate demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries.

Result: Significantly boosts small model performance (up to 33%) using scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with teacher's zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: ICD provides an efficient alternative to fine-tuning for adapting small VLMs to low-resource settings, leveraging in-context learning principles to achieve strong performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

TL;DR: First systematic study of safety/security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving, proposing SafeCoop defense pipeline with semantic firewall, consistency checks, and multi-source consensus to mitigate attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X systems face high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Natural language offers semantic richness and low bandwidth but introduces new vulnerabilities like message loss, hallucinations, and adversarial attacks.

Method: Developed comprehensive attack taxonomy and SafeCoop defense pipeline with semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, multi-source consensus, and agentic transformation for cross-frame spatial alignment.

Result: Evaluated in CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios: 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection.

Conclusion: Provides guidance for advancing safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

TL;DR: World-in-World platform benchmarks generative world models for embodied AI, showing visual quality alone doesn't ensure task success - controllability matters more, and scaling with action-observation data is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on visual quality in isolation, leaving the core question unanswered: do world models actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks?

Method: Introduced World-in-World platform with closed-loop environments, unified planning strategy, and standardized action API to evaluate diverse world models for decision making.

Result: Three key findings: (1) visual quality alone doesn't guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading pretrained video generators; (3) more inference-time compute improves closed-loop performance.

Conclusion: World-in-World provides the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating world models in embodied settings, revealing that task success depends more on controllability than visual quality, with data scaling and compute allocation being crucial factors.

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stereo vision methods struggle with lunar reconstruction due to Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations, and atypical orbital trajectories. Deep learning models trained on human-scale datasets cannot be directly transferred to lunar conditions.

Method: Created LunarStereo dataset using ray tracing based on high-resolution topography and reflectance models. Fine-tuned MASt3R model on this dataset to adapt it to lunar domain.

Result: Significant improvements over zero-shot baselines in 3D surface reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust cross-scale generalization in extraterrestrial environments and paves the way for improved lunar exploration capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with severe inter-person occlusions, dynamic motion patterns, and lack interpretable anomaly indicators in crowded scenes.

Method: Combines head detection and dense optical flow to extract person-specific velocities, uses hierarchical clustering to categorize velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal, fast), and implements percentile-based anomaly scoring.

Result: Effective real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns in densely crowded environments.

Conclusion: VelocityNet successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by providing interpretable anomaly detection that adapts to varying crowd densities and dynamic motion patterns.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RadDiagSeg-D dataset and RadDiagSeg-M model for joint medical diagnosis text generation and pixel-level segmentation in response to visual questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision language models cannot simultaneously generate diagnostic text and segmentation masks, limiting their clinical application value.

Method: Created RadDiagSeg-D dataset combining abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation, then developed RadDiagSeg-M model for joint text-and-mask generation.

Result: RadDiagSeg-M shows strong performance across all components of multi-target text-and-mask generation, providing clinically useful outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the need for enriched contextual information in assistive medical diagnosis by enabling simultaneous text and segmentation generation.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMA-SAM is a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that adds a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer to provide stable tumor tracking in ultrasound videos, improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with radio-frequency ablation (RFA), but accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos remains challenging due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. SAM-2's frame-independent design yields unstable predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound.

Method: EMA-SAM incorporates a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into SAM-2's memory bank, providing a stable latent prototype of the tumor across frames. This preserves temporal coherence during probe pressure and bubble occlusion while rapidly adapting when clear evidence reappears.

Result: On the PTMC-RFA dataset (124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improved maxDice from 0.82 to 0.86 and maxIoU from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by 29%. On external benchmarks (VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp datasets), it achieved consistent gains of 2-5 Dice points over SAM-2. The EMA pointer adds <0.1% FLOPs, preserving real-time throughput of ~30 FPS on a single A100 GPU.

Conclusion: EMA-SAM establishes a robust and efficient framework for stable tumor tracking, bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of interventional ultrasound.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of

TL;DR: VLSU is a comprehensive framework that systematically evaluates multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis, revealing systematic joint understanding failures in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation approaches treat vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination, and fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation to construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art models across 17 distinct safety patterns.

Result: Models achieve 90%+ accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals but performance degrades to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required. 34% of errors occur despite correct classification of individual modalities, demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, providing a critical test bed for research on robust vision-language safety.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

Motivation: Prior debiasing methods are limited by representation diversity, naive generative augmentation preserves biases, and current layout-to-image synthesis lacks fidelity and control for complex scenes.

Method: Introduces representation score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond frequency, creates unbiased layouts, replaces text prompts with precise visual blueprints, and employs generative alignment strategy between detector and generator.

Result: Significantly narrows performance gap for underrepresented object groups - improves large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6 mAP over baseline, and surpasses prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses object detection bias through representation-aware layout generation and high-quality visual synthesis, achieving substantial improvements for underrepresented object groups.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

*Haoran Wei,Yaofeng Sun,Yukun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR compresses long contexts via optical 2D mapping using a DeepEncoder for high compression and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M decoder, achieving 97% OCR accuracy at <10x compression and practical performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping for applications like historical document compression and memory mechanisms in LLMs.

Method: Uses DeepEncoder to maintain low activations under high-resolution input with high compression ratios, and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as decoder for OCR tasks.

Result: Achieves 97% OCR precision at <10x compression, 60% at 20x compression. Outperforms GOT-OCR2.0 with 100 tokens and MinerU2.0 with <800 tokens. Can process 200k+ pages/day on single A100.

Conclusion: Shows considerable promise for long-context compression research and has high practical value for generating training data at scale.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at

*Ajinkya Khoche,Gergő László Nagy,Maciej Wozniak,Thomas Gustafsson,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlendCLIP is a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges the synthetic-to-real gap in 3D object classification by strategically combining synthetic CAD data with real-world LiDAR scans using a curriculum-based data mixing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot 3D object classification faces a significant domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world LiDAR scans. Current methods trained only on synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while real-data-only methods lack semantic diversity for recognizing rare objects.

Method: Proposes a pipeline to generate object-level triplets (point cloud, image, text) from real-world driving data and human-annotated 3D boxes. Uses curriculum-based data mixing that first grounds the model in semantically rich synthetic CAD data, then progressively adapts it to real-world scan characteristics.

Result: Highly label-efficient: adding only 1.5% real-world samples per batch boosts zero-shot accuracy on nuScenes by 27%. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over prior methods by 19.3% on nuScenes while maintaining strong generalization on synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is key to unlocking robust open-vocabulary 3D perception. The approach demonstrates that strategic mixing of synthetic and real data can bridge the domain gap efficiently.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and inconsistencies/missing details when fusing multi-view features from 2D models.

Method: Two-module approach: Context-Aware Feature Extraction (augments masks with rich semantic context) and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation (selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robustness and generality, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality applications.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D
scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world

### [102] [Hyperbolic Space Learning Method Leveraging Temporal Motion Priors for Human Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18256)
*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Weibin Qiu,Zhaocheng Jin,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hyperbolic space learning method with temporal motion prior for 3D human mesh recovery from videos, addressing hierarchical structure limitations in Euclidean space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods learn in Euclidean space, which struggles to capture the natural hierarchical structure of human bodies (torso-limbs-fingers), leading to inaccurate mesh reconstruction.

Method: Designs a temporal motion prior extraction module to combine 3D pose and image feature sequences, then uses hyperbolic space optimization learning with temporal motion prior to optimize mesh features using 3D pose and pose motion information.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show superior performance compared to most state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The hyperbolic space learning approach with temporal motion prior effectively captures hierarchical relationships and produces accurate, smooth human meshes from videos.

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UWBench is a comprehensive underwater vision-language benchmark with 15,003 high-resolution images, 15,281 object referring expressions, and 124,983 QA pairs, designed to evaluate VLMs on underwater scene understanding through captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel in natural scenes but struggle with underwater environments due to unique challenges like light attenuation, color distortion, and specialized marine knowledge requirements.

Method: Created UWBench dataset with diverse underwater images and human-verified annotations, then established three benchmarks: detailed image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on underwater understanding tasks, indicating significant room for improvement in this domain.

Conclusion: UWBench provides essential resources to advance vision-language research in underwater contexts and support marine science applications, with code and benchmark to be publicly available.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.

*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage network for 3D human mesh recovery that leverages latent information and low-dimensional learning to address limb misalignment and insufficient local details while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully exploit latent information like human motion and shape alignment, leading to limb misalignment and insufficient local details. Attention-based methods for mesh-vertex interactions are computationally expensive.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Extract global and local information from low/high-frequency image components into hybrid latent frequency domain features, 2) Use these features to model interactions between rough 3D mesh template and 3D pose through low-dimensional parallel optimization with dimensionality reduction.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving better reconstruction accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limb misalignment and local detail issues in 3D human mesh recovery while maintaining high accuracy with reduced computational burden through latent information exploitation and low-dimensional optimization.

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeFedDG is a novel tree topology framework for federated domain generalization in medical image segmentation that addresses global drift issues through hierarchical aggregation, style mixing, and progressive personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional federated learning methods fail to handle information aggregation imbalance in cross-domain medical imaging scenarios, leading to Global Drift problems that degrade model generalization performance.

Method: Proposes TreeFedDG with: 1) hierarchical parameter aggregation using tree topology, 2) FedStyle parameter difference-based style mixing, 3) progressive personalized fusion strategy, and 4) feature similarity-guided ensemble inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show TreeFedDG outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches and achieves better cross-domain performance balance.

Conclusion: The tree topology framework effectively addresses FedDG-GD problems in medical imaging, providing superior domain generalization while maintaining privacy protection in federated learning settings.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

*Xueyi Chen,Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM is a training-free framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks in streaming video vision-language models through causal temporal reduction and online quantized memory, achieving significant efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming video vision-language models face fundamental constraints of causality (no access to future frames) and accumulation (unbounded token growth), but existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache while leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Causal Temporal Reduction imposes fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, reducing prefill cost; 2) Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them to keep active kv-cache bounded.

Result: Achieves 15.7× kv-cache compression, 1.2× lower peak memory, and 2× faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Maintains state-of-the-art accuracy with 63.8% on offline benchmarks and 55.8%/3.7 on RVS.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach provides practical benefits for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth, demonstrating the importance of addressing both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks.

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

*Vishal Vinod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for identity-preserving 3D face editing using few-shot learning to find latent space directions that enable photorealistic attribute modifications while maintaining view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D face editing is challenging due to view consistency requirements and trade-offs between editability at different resolutions. Existing methods require large labeled datasets and struggle with flexible high-resolution editing.

Method: Leverages 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing techniques to estimate edit directions in latent space using just 10 or fewer labeled attribute images. Uses synthetic images from existing face datasets with masks for few-shot learning.

Result: The method successfully performs 3D-aware attribute editing with few examples, demonstrating linearity of edits through sequential editing and continuous style manifolds for face aging.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient few-shot identity-preserving 3D face editing by identifying latent directions that correspond to photorealistic edits, addressing constraints in traditional 3D face editing methods.

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based monocular depth estimation methods excel at relative depth but struggle with absolute metric depth due to scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios.

Method: Reframes depth estimation as an inverse problem using pretrained latent diffusion models conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric constraints to learn scale and shift parameters.

Result: The approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and specular surfaces, without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free solution effectively integrates stereo guidance into existing diffusion-based depth estimation frameworks and generalizes well across diverse environments.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

TL;DR: Med-RwR is a multimodal medical reasoning framework that actively retrieves external knowledge during diagnosis to address hallucinations and improve accuracy, using reinforcement learning and confidence-driven retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge, leading to hallucinations and factual errors when encountering cases beyond training scope. Current RAG methods are unimodal and neglect visual information.

Method: Two-stage reinforcement learning with tailored rewards to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for retrieval, plus Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval for test-time scaling.

Result: Significant improvements over baseline models on various medical benchmarks, with 8.8% performance gain on EchoCardiography Benchmark despite training data scarcity.

Conclusion: Med-RwR effectively enhances reasoning capabilities through external knowledge integration and demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains.

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will

Motivation: Most multimodal large language models are designed for low-resolution general-purpose images, risking critical information loss in biomedical applications where high-resolution imaging is fundamental.

Method: Investigated how image resolution affects MLLM performance, comparing native-resolution training/inference, resolution misalignment scenarios, and mixed-resolution training approaches.

Result: Native-resolution training and inference significantly improve performance across multiple biomedical tasks. Resolution misalignment between training and inference severely degrades performance. Mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment issues.

Conclusion: Prioritize native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Motivation: Existing autonomous driving world models have limitations in state modalities, sequence length, action precision, and reward awareness. The paper aims to overcome these restrictions by creating a comprehensive framework that handles all three core dimensions effectively.

Method: OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos (RGB, semantics, depth, 3D occupancy) using flexible forcing for long-horizon generation. It introduces normalized panoramic Plucker ray-maps for precise action control and leverages generated 3D occupancy for rule-based dense rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability. It provides a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

Conclusion: OmniNWM successfully addresses the three core dimensions of autonomous driving world models within a unified framework, demonstrating superior performance across video generation, control precision, and reward-based evaluation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

*Jinlin Li,Yuran Wang,Yifei Yuan,Xiao Zhou,Yingying Zhang,Xixian Yong,Yefeng Zheng,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED), a training-free ensemble framework that reduces object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by dynamically weighting multiple models' predictions during inference based on uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from object hallucination (describing nonexistent objects), and existing solutions have limitations in scalability, adaptability, and model independence.

Method: ATED uses token-level ensemble decoding that aggregates predictions from multiple LVLMs with uncertainty-based weights computed dynamically at each decoding step, integrating diverse decoding paths for better contextual grounding.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard hallucination benchmarks, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance.

Conclusion: Adaptive ensembling is a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications, offering a training-free solution to hallucination mitigation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

### [113] [Enhancing Few-Shot Classification of Benchmark and Disaster Imagery with ATTBHFA-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18326)
*Gao Yu Lee,Tanmoy Dam,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Daniel Puiu Poenar,Vu Duong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATTBHFA-Net is a novel Few-Shot Learning method that uses Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distance to aggregate feature probability distributions, improving disaster image classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaster visual recognition faces challenges from limited data, high intra-class variation, and inter-class similarity. Current FSL methods lack specialized approaches for remote-sensing disaster imagery and struggle with these characteristics.

Method: Proposes ATTBHFA-Net that linearly combines Bhattacharyya coefficient (for inter-class separability) and Hellinger distance (for same-class alignment) to compare feature probability distributions. Also introduces a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss.

Result: Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets show superior effectiveness and generalization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses disaster image classification challenges by operating on probability distributions rather than embedded features, demonstrating strong performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: Current NVS methods produce distorted and inconsistent images beyond original trajectories, making realistic view extrapolation challenging for autonomous driving simulation.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: 1) Data-driven pseudo-LiDAR initialization, 2) 2D-SDF road surface modeling, 3) Generative prior for pseudo ground truth, 4) Data-driven adaptation network for artifact removal.

Result: Achieved final score of 0.441 on RealADSim-NVS benchmark, ranking first among all participants at ICCV 2025 workshop.

Conclusion: The comprehensive pipeline effectively addresses street view extrapolation challenges through geometric priors and generative supervision, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative pre-training model for facial knowledge learning using web-built data, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on facial tasks and enabling various face editing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on large-scale pre-training models for facial knowledge compared to natural images, with current approaches relying on manually annotated datasets that are labor-intensive and have limited scalability.

Method: Leverages web-crawled text and images with human faces, using self-supervised pre-training tasks including masked image/language modeling and image-text matching, with image-text matching loss used for controllable generation.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models on facial downstream tasks like attribution classification and expression recognition.

Conclusion: The approach is applicable to various face editing tasks including attribute editing, expression manipulation, mask removal, and photo inpainting, demonstrating broad utility beyond standard classification tasks.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

*Jiayu Zhang,Qilang Ye,Shuo Ye,Xun Lin,Zihan Song,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-Master is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Question Answering that dynamically models temporal and modality dimensions to better extract key information from complex audio-visual scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVQA methods lack flexibility in temporal sampling and modality preference awareness, limiting their reasoning capability in complex scenarios with substantial redundant content.

Method: Proposes dynamic adaptive focus sampling for temporal dimension, preference-aware strategy for modality dimension, and dual-path contrastive loss to reinforce cross-modal consistency and complementarity.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on four large-scale benchmarks, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AV-Master effectively addresses redundancy and fragmentation issues in AVQA through dynamic temporal and modality modeling, achieving superior performance in complex audio-visual reasoning.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

*Yi-Lun Wu,Bo-Kai Ruan,Chiang Tseng,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-DRO is a new preference learning framework for text-to-image diffusion models that addresses limitations of DPO methods by using ranking optimization and combining offline demonstrations with online negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO methods struggle with accurate image probability estimation due to sigmoid function non-linearity and limited diversity in offline datasets, motivating a more robust approach.

Method: Diffusion-DRO uses inverse reinforcement learning to frame preference learning as a ranking problem, simplifying training into denoising formulation and integrating offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show Diffusion-DRO delivers improved generation quality across challenging prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and user studies.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO effectively addresses DPO limitations and provides superior alignment with human preferences for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

*Jiajun Hong,Jianan Wei,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupHOI is a framework for Human-Object Interaction Detection that models interactions from a group perspective using geometric proximity and semantic similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI-DET methods focus primarily on pairwise relationships, overlooking that real-world interactions often emerge from collective behaviors involving multiple humans and objects in joint activities.

Method: GroupHOI propagates contextual information using geometric proximity (learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features) and semantic similarity (enhanced transformer-based interaction decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features). Humans and objects are grouped into clusters, and soft correspondence via self-attention aggregates/dispatches contextual cues within groups.

Result: Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Also shows leading performance on the more challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task involving higher-order interactions within groups.

Conclusion: Modeling interactions from a group perspective with geometric proximity and semantic similarity significantly improves HOI detection performance, especially for complex scenarios involving collective behaviors and higher-order interactions.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

### [119] [FeatureFool: Zero-Query Fooling of Video Models via Feature Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18362)
*Duoxun Tang,Xi Xiao,Guangwu Hu,Kangkang Sun,Xiao Yang,Dongyang Chen,Qing Li,Yongjie Yin,Jiyao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeatureFool is a zero-query black-box attack that uses DNN-extracted information to alter video feature spaces, achieving over 70% success rate against video classifiers without queries and bypassing Video-LLM recognition through feature map transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box adversarial attacks require multiple queries and interactions with models, which is impractical for real-world applications and doesn't scale well to Video-LLMs. No existing video-domain attacks directly leverage feature maps to shift clean-video feature space.

Method: FeatureFool performs zero-query attacks by directly exploiting information extracted from DNNs to alter the feature space of clean videos, unlike query-based methods that rely on iterative interaction.

Result: Achieves over 70% attack success rate against traditional video classifiers without any queries. Successfully crafts harmful content that bypasses Video-LLM recognition through feature map transferability. Generated adversarial videos show high quality with good SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency metrics.

Conclusion: FeatureFool demonstrates an efficient, unprecedented zero-query attack approach in the video domain that is stealthy, practical for real-world applications, and scalable to Video-LLMs while maintaining high perceptual quality.

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

*Yuqing Luo,Yixiao Li,Jiang Liu,Jun Fu,Hadi Amirpour,Guanghui Yue,Baoquan Zhao,Padraig Corcoran,Hantao Liu,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CM-SSA, a cross-modal scene semantic alignment method for image complexity assessment that leverages text prompts to align scene semantics, improving consistency with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICA methods rely on single visual modality features which are insufficient to capture perceived complexity. Cross-modal scene semantic information has shown promise in perceptual tasks but hasn't been explored for ICA.

Method: CM-SSA consists of two branches: complexity regression branch estimates complexity levels, and scene semantic alignment branch aligns images with text prompts through pair-wise learning to leverage rich scene semantic information.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple ICA datasets show CM-SSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Cross-modal scene semantic alignment effectively enhances image complexity assessment performance and makes predictions more consistent with human subjective perception.

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2AP is a plug-in method for adversarial pruning that minimizes score-space sharpness during mask selection to stabilize pruning and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial pruning methods suffer from unstable mask selection due to sharp local minima in score-space optimization, which reduces robustness.

Method: Proposes score-space sharpness minimization that perturbs importance scores and minimizes robust loss during mask search, stabilizing the pruning process.

Result: Extensive experiments show S2AP effectively minimizes sharpness in score space, stabilizes mask selection, and improves robustness across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels.

Conclusion: S2AP successfully addresses the instability in adversarial pruning by introducing score-space sharpness minimization, leading to more robust compressed models.

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Conclusion: The entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and robust metric for cortical morphometry, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical research applications in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

*Linsong Shan,Zecan Yang,Laurence T. Yang,Changlong Li,Honglu Zhao,Xin Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN), a probabilistic tensor decomposition method for hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion that overcomes limitations of existing methods by preserving spatial-spectral structures and modeling cross-dimensional correlations through hierarchical sparse priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods for HMF disrupt spatial-spectral structures through data vectorization/reshaping, impose rigid constraints, require extensive manual parameter tuning, and lack robustness against noise and spatial degradation.

Method: Proposed Bayesian FCTN method with hierarchical sparse prior that connects factor tensors and models intrinsic physical coupling. Uses Variational Bayesian inference and Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter estimation to reduce manual tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show BFCTN achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy, strong robustness against noise and spatial degradation, and practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: BFCTN effectively addresses limitations of existing tensor decomposition methods by preserving spatial-spectral structures, modeling cross-dimensional correlations, and reducing manual parameter tuning while achieving superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

*Zhiwei Hao,Jianyuan Guo,Li Shen,Kai Han,Yehui Tang,Han Hu,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleNet enables efficient scaling of vision transformers by inserting additional layers with weight sharing and adjustment parameters, achieving better performance with fewer training epochs compared to training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training larger vision transformer models is computationally intensive and costly, creating a need for more efficient scaling methods that build on existing pretrained models.

Method: ScaleNet inserts additional layers into pretrained ViTs using layer-wise weight sharing and parallel adapter modules with adjustment parameters to maintain parameter efficiency while optimizing performance.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, ScaleNet achieved 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch with a 2× depth-scaled DeiT-Base model, using only one-third of the training epochs.

Conclusion: ScaleNet provides an efficient and cost-effective solution for scaling vision transformers, with demonstrated success in image classification and potential for broader application in downstream vision tasks like object detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageGem is a dataset for studying generative models that understand fine-grained individual preferences, featuring real-world interaction data from 57K users with 242K customized LoRAs, 3M text prompts, and 5M generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge hindering the development of generative models that understand individual preferences is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations.

Method: Leveraging individual user preference data from the ImageGem dataset, the study trains preference alignment models, investigates retrieval models and vision-language models on personalized tasks, and proposes an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in latent weight space.

Result: The dataset enabled training better preference alignment models and demonstrated new capabilities for personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation.

Conclusion: ImageGem dataset enables a new paradigm for generative model personalization by providing fine-grained individual preference annotations.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

### [127] [Beyond Single Images: Retrieval Self-Augmented Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18437)
*Ji Du,Xin Wang,Fangwei Hao,Mingyang Yu,Chunyuan Chen,Jiesheng Wu,Bin Wang,Jing Xu,Ping Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE is a retrieval-based self-augmented paradigm for camouflaged object detection that generates pseudo-labels using dataset-level contextual information without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current COD methods rely heavily on image-level modeling or annotation-based optimization, failing to leverage valuable dataset-level contextual information and requiring laborious manual annotations.

Method: RISE constructs prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using training images without ground truth, then uses KNN retrieval with a Clustering-then-Retrieval strategy and Multi-View KNN Retrieval to generate robust pseudo-masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show RISE outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods in camouflaged object detection.

Conclusion: RISE demonstrates that leveraging dataset-level contextual information through retrieval-based self-augmentation can effectively generate pseudo-labels for COD without manual annotations, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new latent diffusion model generates high-quality 3D chest CT scans from anatomical masks, enabling precise control over lung and nodule features with reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a computationally efficient method for generating realistic 3D chest CT scans that can be precisely controlled via anatomical masks, supporting AI model training and healthcare education.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion model conditioned on 3D anatomical masks (lung and nodule regions) to synthesize 256x256x256 volumetric CT images at 1 mm resolution on a single mid-range GPU.

Result: The model successfully generates diverse CT volumes with controlled nodule attributes, but conditioning only on nodule masks produces anatomically incorrect outputs, demonstrating the necessity of including global lung structure.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient tool for generating realistic 3D chest CT scans with precise anatomical control, valuable for training AI models and healthcare professionals, while emphasizing the importance of incorporating global anatomical context.

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

*Tianci Bi,Xiaoyi Zhang,Yan Lu,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VFM-VAE, a direct integration approach for Vision Foundation Models in Latent Diffusion Models that bypasses distillation, achieving superior performance and 10x faster convergence through novel decoder design and joint training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation-based approaches for incorporating Vision Foundation Models into LDMs weaken robustness and cause semantic deviation under distribution shifts, necessitating a more direct integration method.

Method: Proposes VFM-VAE with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks in the decoder, plus a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy using SE-CKNNA metric for representation analysis.

Result: Achieves gFID of 2.20 in just 80 epochs (10x speedup) and gFID of 1.62 after 640 epochs, establishing direct VFM integration as superior to distillation approaches.

Conclusion: Direct VFM integration through VFM-VAE with proper decoder design and joint training strategy is a superior paradigm for LDMs, offering better performance, efficiency, and robustness compared to distillation methods.

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

TL;DR: Mono4DGS-HDR is the first system for reconstructing 4D HDR scenes from unposed monocular LDR videos with alternating exposures, using a two-stage Gaussian Splatting approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of reconstructing renderable 4D HDR scenes from unposed monocular LDR videos with alternating exposures, which hasn't been studied before.

Method: Two-stage optimization framework: 1) Learns video HDR Gaussian representation in orthographic camera space without poses, 2) Transforms to world space and jointly refines Gaussians with camera poses, plus temporal luminance regularization for HDR consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms adapted state-of-the-art methods in both rendering quality and speed, demonstrated through extensive experiments on a new evaluation benchmark.

Conclusion: Mono4DGS-HDR successfully reconstructs high-quality 4D HDR scenes from challenging unposed monocular LDR video inputs with alternating exposures.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

TL;DR: A pipeline combining vision language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation enables zero-shot vehicle make and model recognition through text-based reasoning, improving accuracy by nearly 20% over CLIP baseline without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VMMR approaches struggle to adapt to newly released vehicle models, and CLIP's fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly finetuning.

Method: VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a textual feature database. Retrieved entries are combined with descriptions to form prompts for language model inference of make and model.

Result: The proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over CLIP baseline, demonstrating effective zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: RAG-enhanced LM reasoning enables scalable VMMR without large-scale retraining, supporting rapid updates through textual descriptions of new vehicles for smart-city applications.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

TL;DR: DWaste is a computer vision platform for real-time waste sorting on smartphones and edge devices, achieving high efficiency through optimized model selection and quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the environmental impact of convenience packaging waste by enabling efficient waste sorting through accessible technology on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Benchmarked various image classification (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object detection models (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using custom waste dataset annotated with Annotated Lab tool, with model quantization for efficiency optimization.

Result: EfficientNetV2S achieved highest accuracy (96%) but with high latency (0.22s) and emissions. Lightweight object detection models delivered strong performance (77% mAP) with ultra-fast inference (0.03s) and small model sizes (<7MB). Quantization reduced model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%.

Conclusion: Lightweight object detection models with quantization are ideal for real-time, low-power waste sorting on edge devices, demonstrating successful implementation of "Greener AI" for sustainable waste management.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

*Junwen Huang,Shishir Reddy Vutukur,Peter KT Yu,Nassir Navab,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diffusion transformer-based method for template-based object pose estimation that reformulates the problem as ray alignment between query images and posed templates, achieving competitive performance on unseen object pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional template-based pose estimation methods often fail when retrieving incorrect templates, leading to inaccurate pose predictions. The authors aim to address this limitation by developing a more robust approach.

Method: Reformulates pose estimation as a ray alignment problem using a diffusion transformer architecture. Uses object-centered camera rays for rotation and dense translation offsets for translation. Implements a coarse-to-fine training strategy with narrowed template sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed ray alignment formulation with diffusion transformers provides an effective solution for template-based object pose estimation, overcoming limitations of traditional template retrieval methods.

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GBlobs, a local point cloud feature descriptor that improves 3D object detection generalization across different LiDAR sensor placements by avoiding geometric shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors suffer from geometric shortcuts that cause models to rely on absolute position rather than object characteristics, limiting generalization to different sensor placements.

Method: The approach uses GBlobs as network input features - local point cloud feature descriptors designed to circumvent geometric shortcuts and force learning of object-centric representations.

Result: The method achieved state-of-the-art performance in RoboSense 2025 Track 3, demonstrating exceptional generalization capability across diverse LiDAR configurations.

Conclusion: GBlobs effectively address the geometric shortcut problem in 3D object detection, enabling robust generalization to varying sensor placements by learning object-centric representations rather than position-dependent features.

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Occluded nuScenes Dataset, an extension of nuScenes benchmark with controlled, parameterized sensor occlusions for cameras, radar, and LiDAR to enable systematic evaluation of perception models under adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving datasets lack controlled, parameterized, and reproducible sensor degradations, limiting systematic evaluation of perception and fusion architectures under well-defined adverse conditions like sensor failures and environmental occlusions.

Method: Created an extension of nuScenes benchmark with: camera occlusions (4 types, including 2 adapted and 2 new designs), and parameterized occlusion scripts for radar and LiDAR (3 degradation types each) for flexible and repeatable generation of occluded data.

Result: Developed the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, supporting consistent evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.

Conclusion: The dataset advances research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving by enabling systematic evaluation under adverse conditions.

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

TL;DR: Kaleido is a subject-to-video generation framework that improves multi-subject consistency and background disentanglement in video synthesis from multiple reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing S2V models struggle with maintaining multi-subject consistency and handling background disentanglement, leading to poor reference fidelity and semantic drift when using multiple reference images.

Method: Proposes a data construction pipeline with quality filtering and diverse data synthesis, plus Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) for stable multi-image integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Kaleido represents an advance in S2V generation by effectively addressing multi-subject consistency and background disentanglement challenges.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

TL;DR: CovMatch is a scalable multimodal dataset distillation framework that enables joint optimization of both image and text encoders by aligning cross-covariance of real and synthetic features, achieving up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy with only 500 synthetic pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior multimodal dataset distillation methods freeze the text encoder to reduce computational cost, but this severely limits semantic alignment and becomes a performance bottleneck. There's a need for scalable approaches that can jointly optimize both encoders for better cross-modal alignment.

Method: Proposes CovMatch framework that aligns cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, it enables joint optimization of both image and text encoders.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods on Flickr30K and COCO datasets, achieving up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic image-text pairs.

Conclusion: CovMatch demonstrates that joint optimization of both encoders in multimodal dataset distillation leads to stronger cross-modal alignment and improved performance compared to approaches that freeze the text encoder.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DThinker is a framework that enables 3D mental reasoning without 3D prior inputs or labeled 3D training data, outperforming existing methods on spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with 3D spatial relationships from limited views, as existing methods rely on text or 2D visual cues with limited representational capacity for 3D spatial imagination.

Method: Two-stage training: first supervised training to align 3D latent representations with a 3D foundation model, then optimization of reasoning trajectory based on outcome signals to refine 3D mentaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a new perspective for unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning without requiring explicit 3D data or prior inputs.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently

*Baptiste Bauvin,Loïc Baret,Ola Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel one-shot pruning framework using explainable deep learning with causal-aware approach to efficiently reduce model size without fine-tuning, achieving minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational expense of iterative retraining in structured pruning and performance drop in existing one-shot methods, enabling efficient model compression for deployment.

Method: Causal-aware pruning approach leveraging cause-effect relations between predictions and structures in progressive pruning process, applied directly at post-training without fine-tuning.

Result: Substantial model size reductions with minimal performance impact on CNN and Vision Transformer baselines, outperforming counterparts with best trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed one-shot pruning framework effectively reduces model size while maintaining performance, offering superior trade-off compared to existing methods without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

*Sheida Rahnamai Kordasiabi,Damian Dalle Nogare,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ε-Seg is a hierarchical variational autoencoder method for semantic segmentation of EM images using center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning, GMM prior, and clustering-free label prediction to achieve competitive results with very sparse labels (0.05% or less).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of EM images is challenging due to complex biological structures that can overwhelm even human observers, and existing methods struggle with sparse labeling requirements.

Method: Uses hierarchical VAEs with center-region masking for robust embeddings, sparse label contrastive learning and GMM prior to shape latent space for class separation, and MLP segmentation head for direct label prediction instead of clustering.

Result: Achieves competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on complex biological image data with limited training labels (0.05% or less), demonstrated on 2 dense EM datasets and fluorescence microscopy data.

Conclusion: ε-Seg provides an effective solution for semantic segmentation of complex biological images with very sparse labels, making it practical for life sciences applications where dense labeling is infeasible.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

*Kyo Kuroki,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Thiem Van Chu,Kazushi Kawamura,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BQQ is a novel matrix quantization method using binary quadratic expressions instead of linear combinations, achieving superior memory efficiency and reconstruction error trade-offs in matrix compression and neural network PTQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional first-order quantization methods by leveraging the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining compact data formats.

Method: Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ) uses binary quadratic expressions for matrix approximation, validated through matrix compression benchmarks and post-training quantization on Vision Transformer models.

Result: BQQ consistently outperforms conventional methods in memory efficiency vs reconstruction error trade-off. Achieves up to 2.2% and 59.1% improvement on ImageNet under calibration-based and data-free scenarios with 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: Binary quadratic expressions are surprisingly effective for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel interactive satellite image change detection method using active learning with an invertible network for data augmentation in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve satellite image change detection by interactively querying users for labels and dynamically updating the model through efficient data augmentation.

Method: Uses an iterative active learning framework with a question-and-answer model that queries users about image labels, and employs a novel invertible network to augment displays by mapping them to latent spaces where transformations are linear.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance compared to related work.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances change detection through interactive learning and latent space augmentation.

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes factors affecting end-to-end deep learning for historical writer identification, finding most models struggle with generalization in realistic settings but identifying one setup that achieves competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical writer identification remains challenging due to handwriting diversity, document degradation, and limited labeled samples. Traditional methods work well on curated datasets but end-to-end approaches struggle with generalization, especially in zero-shot scenarios.

Method: The study explores combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies including text segmentation, patch sampling, and feature aggregation.

Result: Most configurations performed poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. However, one end-to-end setup achieved results comparable to the top-performing system.

Conclusion: The findings highlight key challenges in building robust end-to-end systems and provide insights into design choices that improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGA is a sparse attention mechanism that uses learnable token routing to enable efficient long video generation by reducing quadratic attention complexity while maintaining effective long-range interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers is limited by the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length, and existing sparse methods have constrained accuracy-efficiency trade-offs due to blockwise coarse estimation.

Method: Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA) uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens without blockwise estimation, enabling semantic-aware routing and seamless integration with modern attention stacks like FlashAttention.

Result: Developed an efficient long video generation model that produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps with a context length of approximately 580k, validated through comprehensive experiments on various video generation tasks.

Conclusion: MoGA provides an effective sparse attention solution that overcomes the quadratic scaling limitations of full attention, enabling practical long video generation while maintaining high quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: UniGenBench++ is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-to-image generation models, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks by providing diverse multilingual prompts and fine-grained semantic assessment across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I benchmarks lack diversity in prompt scenarios, multilingual support, and fine-grained sub-dimension assessment, limiting their real-world applicability and comprehensive evaluation capabilities.

Method: Developed UniGenBench++ with 600 prompts organized hierarchically across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes, with English and Chinese versions in short/long forms. Used Gemini-2.5-Pro MLLM for benchmark construction and trained an offline evaluation model for community use.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of T2I models across 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation criteria, revealing strengths and weaknesses of both open- and closed-source models across various aspects.

Conclusion: UniGenBench++ provides a unified, comprehensive semantic assessment framework for T2I generation that addresses key limitations of existing benchmarks and facilitates robust model evaluation.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

*Yiqi Lin,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Linjie Li,Zhengyuan Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VC2L is a unified vision-centric framework that renders all inputs as images for multimodal learning, eliminating need for OCR or modality fusion, and achieves competitive performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive vision-language models like CLIP struggle with complex web documents where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded visually, requiring better handling of multimodal web content.

Method: Uses a single vision transformer to model all inputs in pixel space by rendering text, images, and combinations as images. Employs snippet-level contrastive learning to align consecutive multimodal segments without requiring explicit image-text pairs.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on proposed benchmarks (AnyCIR, SeqCIR, CSR) and established datasets like M-BEIR and MTEB.

Conclusion: Multimodal web data is valuable for contrastive learning, and vision-centric unified approaches are scalable for multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EMIM, a module that integrates motion modeling from cost volumes into transformers for better action recognition, especially on motion-sensitive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based methods perform well on scene-related datasets but lack motion modeling for motion-sensitive datasets. Cost volumes in traditional methods have strong motion modeling capabilities similar to attention mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Explicit Motion Information Mining (EMIM) module that constructs affinity matrix in cost volume style by sampling key tokens from neighboring areas in next frame, then uses it for both appearance and motion modeling.

Result: Validated on four datasets, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on motion-sensitive Something-Something V1 & V2 datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating cost volume-style motion modeling into transformers effectively improves performance on motion-sensitive action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting geometric regularities with compact planar representations, without requiring camera pose information or 3D plane annotations during training.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers to extract sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting with gradient propagation through rendered depth and normal maps.

Result: Validated on multiple indoor-scene datasets with strong generalization to out-of-domain environments, achieving good performance in 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, relative pose estimation, and plane segmentation.

Conclusion: PLANA3R enables scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using only depth and normal annotations, emerging with accurate plane segmentation capabilities through planar 3D representation.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

*Siyong Jian,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a KV cache compression framework for autoregressive image generation models that reduces memory usage by 5x and speeds up throughput by 6.6x with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro have high memory and computational costs due to large numbers of visual tokens, and KV cache compression has been well-studied for language models but not for image generation.

Method: Identifies spatial locality and emergent semantic sink phenomena, then compresses KV cache by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two types: spatial-locality heads maintain short recent token windows, while semantic-sink heads preserve compact sets of highly-attended tokens.

Result: Achieves 5x reduction in memory usage and 6.6x speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss.

Conclusion: Enables highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware through effective KV cache compression.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

TL;DR: IF-VidCap is a new benchmark for evaluating controllable video captioning that assesses instruction-following capabilities, revealing that while proprietary models still lead, open-source solutions are catching up and dense captioning models underperform on complex instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video captioning benchmarks focus on descriptive comprehensiveness but overlook instruction-following capabilities, which are crucial for practical applications where users need specific types of captions rather than exhaustive descriptions.

Method: Created IF-VidCap benchmark with 1,400 high-quality samples and a systematic evaluation framework that assesses captions on format correctness and content correctness dimensions.

Result: Evaluation of 20+ models shows proprietary models still dominate but open-source solutions are achieving near-parity. Dense captioning models underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions.

Conclusion: Future work should advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity simultaneously, as current specialized dense captioning models struggle with complex instructions.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

TL;DR: ColIAGS is an improved 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for colonoscopy that addresses illumination variations by modeling two types of illumination attenuation factors and using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance geometry accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard 3DGS assumes static illumination and fails to handle photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes caused by dynamic light sources and camera movement, leading to degraded 3D reconstruction quality with vaporous Gaussian blobs.

Method: Proposes Improved Appearance Modeling with two illumination attenuation factors, Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding for better Gaussian geometry prediction, and cosine embedding for implicit illumination attenuation solutions.

Result: Achieves superior rendering fidelity and significantly reduces Depth MSE compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction.

Conclusion: ColIAGS successfully addresses illumination variation challenges in colonoscopy 3D reconstruction while maintaining geometry accuracy, outperforming existing methods in both rendering quality and geometric precision.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

*Zhenqi He,Yuanpei Liu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEAL is a hierarchical learning framework for Generalized Category Discovery that uses semantic hierarchies to improve classification of both known and unknown classes in partially labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD approaches rely on single-level semantics or manually designed hierarchies, limiting their generalizability and scalability.

Method: Proposes SEAL with Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning to generate informative soft negatives using hierarchical similarity, and a Cross-Granularity Consistency module to align predictions across granularity levels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks (SSB, Oxford-Pet, Herbarium19) and demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively addresses GCD limitations by leveraging natural hierarchical structures for improved classification performance across different granularities.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

TL;DR: Geospatial foundation models can accurately predict urban heat patterns and evaluate mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions, supporting climate-resilient cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heat island effects are worsening due to urbanization and climate change, but conventional ML models with limited data produce inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved areas.

Method: Fine-tuned geospatial foundation models using empirical ground truth of urban heat patterns, quantified cooling effects from green spaces, and simulated inpainting for future climate scenarios.

Result: Foundation models demonstrated strong generalization and accurate prediction of land surface temperatures, offering practical value for mitigation support.

Conclusion: Geospatial foundation models provide a powerful approach for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions to build more climate-resilient cities.

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

*Teng Hu,Jiangning Zhang,Zihan Su,Ran Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraGen enables efficient end-to-end native high-resolution video generation (up to 4K) by addressing computational bottlenecks in diffusion transformer models through hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the quadratic computational complexity limitation in existing diffusion transformer video generation models that restricts them to low-resolution outputs (≤720P), making native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical.

Method: Proposes UltraGen with hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture: global-local attention decomposition, spatially compressed global modeling, and hierarchical cross-window local attention to reduce computational costs while maintaining quality.

Result: Successfully scales pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and 4K resolution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: UltraGen provides an effective solution for native high-resolution video generation, breaking the computational barriers that previously limited diffusion transformer models to low-resolution outputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

### [155] [Rebellious Student: A Complementary Learning Framework for Background Feature Enhancement in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18781)
*Wenping Jin,Yuyang Tang,Li Zhu,Fei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A "Rebellious Student" framework for hyperspectral anomaly detection that trains spatial and spectral branches to learn complementary features through intentional divergence rather than imitation, enabling universal deployment without per-scene retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hyperspectral anomaly detection by integrating spectral and spatial cues through complementary feature learning, building on methods that can be trained once and universally deployed without per-scene retraining.

Method: Two-stage learning: (1) train spectral enhancement network via reverse distillation for robust background spectral representations; (2) train spatial network ("rebellious student") using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over established baselines with minimal computational overhead, confirming effectiveness and generality of the complementary learning paradigm.

Conclusion: The proposed "Rebellious Student" framework successfully learns complementary spatial patterns that spectral features fail to capture, enabling parameter-free and training-free anomaly detection with enhanced performance.

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

*Ling Xing,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Rui Yan,Hongyu Qu,Zechao Li,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeTok renders text as images and uses multimodal LLMs to interpret them, achieving comparable performance to subword tokenizers with 4.43x fewer tokens and 70.5% FLOPs reduction, while improving cross-lingual generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans read text visually by recognizing shapes and patterns, while current LLMs rely on subword tokenization that fragments text and performs poorly on low-resource languages, creating long meaningless sequences and computational inefficiency.

Method: SeeTok converts text into visual images and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs' OCR and text-vision alignment capabilities to interpret the rendered text, moving from symbolic tokenization to visual reading.

Result: SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers across three language tasks while requiring significantly fewer tokens (4.43x reduction) and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional benefits in cross-lingual generalization, typographic noise robustness, and linguistic hierarchy.

Conclusion: SeeTok represents a paradigm shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, demonstrating that vision-centric approaches can create more natural and cognitively inspired language models with improved efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

*Xiaoxing Hu,Kaicheng Yang,Ziyong Feng,Qi Ming,Zonghao Guo,Xiang An,Ziyong Feng,Junchi Yan,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProCLIP is a curriculum learning framework that progressively aligns LLM-based text embedders with CLIP's image encoder to handle long texts and multilingual inputs while preserving CLIP's original vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's text encoder has limitations: 77-token max length, no multilingual support, and poor fine-grained semantic understanding. Direct replacement with LLMs disrupts CLIP's existing vision-language alignment.

Method: Uses curriculum learning with two stages: 1) Knowledge distillation from CLIP text encoder to LLM embedder, 2) Image-text contrastive tuning with self-distillation regularization. Employs instance semantic alignment and embedding structure alignment losses.

Result: The framework effectively aligns LLM-based embedders with CLIP image encoder while preserving pretrained knowledge and avoiding disruption of original vision-language alignment.

Conclusion: ProCLIP enables CLIP to handle long texts and multilingual inputs through progressive alignment, overcoming limitations of direct LLM replacement while maintaining the benefits of CLIP's pretrained vision-language space.

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more intuitive, geometric approach to steerable CNNs instead of abstract group theory, making the concepts more accessible and practical.

Method: Geometric derivation based on pattern matching principles, with novel construction of steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels.

Result: Intuitive explanation for Clebsch-Gordan decomposition and spherical harmonics, plus improved robustness to noisy data through better interpolation kernels.

Conclusion: The geometric approach offers clearer understanding of steerable CNNs and practical improvements in implementation robustness.

Abstract: In contrast to the somewhat abstract, group theoretical approach adopted by
many papers, our work provides a new and more intuitive derivation of steerable
convolutional neural networks in $d$ dimensions. This derivation is based on
geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an
intuitive explanation for the appearance of the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition
and spherical harmonic basis functions. Furthermore, we suggest a novel way to
construct steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels that improve
upon existing implementation, and offer greater robustness to noisy data.

TL;DR: GAR is a region-level multimodal model that addresses limitations in fine-grained visual understanding by leveraging global contexts and modeling interactions between multiple regions, enabling advanced compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with dense scenes requiring fine-grained analysis and object inter-relationships. Existing region-level approaches understand regions in isolation without global context.

Method: Proposes GAR with RoI-aligned feature replay technique to support precise perception using global contexts, modeling interactions between multiple prompts, and achieving compositional reasoning.

Result: GAR-1B outperforms DAM-3B by +4.5 on DLC-Bench, surpasses InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA, and GAR-8B outperforms VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, showing strong transfer to videos.

Conclusion: GAR enables comprehensive region-level visual understanding by leveraging global contexts and modeling multi-region interactions, shifting from passive description to active dialogue with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

TL;DR: A teacher-student AI framework improves tuberculosis and COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays using supervised and self-supervised learning, achieving high accuracy and explainable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tuberculosis detection is critical in resource-limited areas where radiologists are scarce, but AI models need large datasets which are expensive to obtain.

Method: Proposed a teacher-student framework with two supervised heads for disease/symptom detection and a self-supervised head to enhance learning from limited data.

Result: Achieved 98.85% accuracy for COVID-19/tuberculosis/normal classification and 90.09% macro-F1 score for symptom detection, outperforming baselines with explainable predictions.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for clinical deployment in screening and triage settings, particularly in resource-limited areas.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 2++ is a unified video tracking model that handles multiple granularities (masks, boxes, points) through task-specific prompts, unified decoder, and task-adaptive memory mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trackers are tailored to single tasks with custom-designed modules, limiting generalization and causing redundancy in model design and parameters. There's a need for a unified approach that can handle tracking at any granularity.

Method: 1) Task-specific prompts to encode various inputs into general embeddings; 2) Unified decoder to standardize diverse task outputs; 3) Task-adaptive memory mechanism for cross-granularity memory matching; 4) Custom data engine producing Tracking-Any-Granularity dataset with rich annotations.

Result: SAM 2++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks for diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, confirming its effectiveness as a unified tracking framework.

Conclusion: SAM 2++ establishes a robust unified tracking framework that successfully handles tracking at any granularity, overcoming limitations of task-specific trackers and setting new standards in the field.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

TL;DR: Proposes M3Dphormer, a unified hierarchical mask framework for Graph Transformers that reveals equivalence between architecture and attention masks, enabling flexible modeling of diverse node interactions through theoretically-grounded mask design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Transformers rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting flexibility. Need a unified approach to model diverse node interactions consistently.

Method: Introduces M3Dphormer with hierarchical mask framework, three theoretically grounded masks, bi-level expert routing for adaptive integration, and dual attention computation (dense/sparse modes) for scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the unified framework and model design.

Conclusion: The unified hierarchical mask framework successfully addresses flexibility limitations in Graph Transformers, with M3Dphormer achieving superior performance through theoretically-principled mask design and adaptive integration mechanisms.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDEAP is an adaptive federated prompt tuning framework that enhances CLIP's generalization in multi-domain federated learning by disentangling semantic and domain features, using dual-prompt design, and aligning visual-textual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients, which hinder the generalization of aggregated models. CLIP's strong zero-shot capabilities raise the question of how to effectively fine-tune it in federated settings across multiple domains.

Method: Three key components: (1) Disentangle semantic and domain-specific features using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased mappings; (2) Dual-prompt design with global semantic prompt and local domain prompt; (3) Align textual and visual representations under learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDEAP in enhancing CLIP's generalization for federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Conclusion: FedDEAP successfully addresses domain shift and label heterogeneity in federated learning by adaptively tuning CLIP prompts, achieving improved generalization performance in multi-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP²O-SR is a framework that optimizes real-world image super-resolution models using perceptual preferences without human annotations, leveraging hybrid quality assessment and hierarchical optimization to improve perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I diffusion models for Real-ISR produce outputs with varying perceptual quality due to inherent stochasticity. This randomness creates a wider quality range that can be exploited to improve performance without costly human annotations.

Method: Uses hybrid reward combining full-reference and no-reference IQA models trained on human preference data. Constructs multiple preference pairs from same model outputs and employs hierarchical preference optimization with adaptive weighting based on reward gaps and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show DP²O-SR significantly improves perceptual quality across diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively aligns generative models with perceptual preferences, with optimal selection strategy depending on model capacity and hierarchical optimization enabling efficient learning.

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

Method: Created DSI-Bench benchmark with spatially and temporally symmetric designs to reduce biases, covering nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects.

Conclusion: DSI-Bench provides valuable insights for future development of general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence, highlighting current limitations in dynamic spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A generalizable 3D light transport embedding method that predicts global illumination directly from 3D scene configurations using point clouds and transformers, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural methods for global illumination rely on per-scene optimization or 2D approaches that suffer from view inconsistency and limited spatial understanding. There's a need for generalizable 3D methods that can handle diverse scenes without explicit ray-traced cues.

Method: Represent scenes as point clouds with geometric and material features. Use scalable transformers to model global point-to-point interactions and encode features into neural primitives. At render time, query points retrieve nearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregate latent features through cross-attention to predict rendering quantities.

Result: Demonstrated successful diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse indoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks with limited fine-tuning. Also showed preliminary results for spatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and accelerated unbiased path guiding.

Conclusion: This approach provides a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines without explicit ray-traced illumination cues, offering a generalizable solution for global illumination that overcomes limitations of current 2D and per-scene optimization methods.

Abstract: Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains
computationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light
transport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,
sometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward
cross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as
neural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view
inconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D
light transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from
3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each
scene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A
scalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these
features into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves
nearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent
features through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We
demonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse
indoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding
trained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks
with limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for
spatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how
the normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach
highlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines
without explicit ray-traced illumination cues.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as embodied brains in robotic manipulation tasks, covering 5 dimensions, 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs using real robotic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for embodied AI systems focus mainly on execution success or offer limited task realism, providing an incomplete picture of cognitive capabilities needed for high-level reasoning in manipulation tasks.

Method: RoboBench defines five evaluation dimensions (instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, failure analysis) and introduces MLLM-as-world-simulator framework to evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes.

Result: Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations including difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis.

Conclusion: RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition and guide the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured
environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a
dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System
1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the
embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and
decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation
of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution
success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete
dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of
cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark
that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation
pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,
perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure
analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure
realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,
and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For
planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,
MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether
predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14
MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction
comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained
affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a
comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the
development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in

TL;DR: A unified methodology for AI model inference evaluation that integrates computational and environmental metrics under realistic serving conditions, enabling reproducible benchmarking across hardware, software, and precision levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI performance evaluation methods are fragmented and fail to provide holistic views, making it difficult to compare and optimize systems across heterogeneous hardware, software stacks, and numeric precisions.

Method: Proposes a reproducible framework that systematically measures latency, throughput distributions, energy consumption, and location-adjusted carbon emissions while maintaining matched accuracy constraints. Applied to multi-precision models across diverse hardware platforms (GH200 to RTX 4090) and software stacks (PyTorch, TensorRT, ONNX Runtime).

Result: Establishes a rigorous benchmarking framework that produces decision-ready Pareto frontiers, clarifying trade-offs between accuracy, latency, energy, and carbon emissions.

Conclusion: The methodology enables evidence-based decisions for sustainable AI deployment, with open-source code provided for independent verification and adoption.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demands for computational power, yet methods for evaluating the
performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of deployed models remain
fragmented. Current approaches often fail to provide a holistic view, making it
difficult to compare and optimise systems across heterogeneous hardware,
software stacks, and numeric precisions. To address this gap, we propose a
unified and reproducible methodology for AI model inference that integrates
computational and environmental metrics under realistic serving conditions. Our
framework provides a pragmatic, carbon-aware evaluation by systematically
measuring latency and throughput distributions, energy consumption, and
location-adjusted carbon emissions, all while maintaining matched accuracy
constraints for valid comparisons. We apply this methodology to multi-precision
models across diverse hardware platforms, from data-centre accelerators like
the GH200 to consumer-level GPUs such as the RTX 4090, running on mainstream
software stacks including PyTorch, TensorRT, and ONNX Runtime. By
systematically categorising these factors, our work establishes a rigorous
benchmarking framework that produces decision-ready Pareto frontiers,
clarifying the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, energy, and carbon. The
accompanying open-source code enables independent verification and facilitates
adoption, empowering researchers and practitioners to make evidence-based
decisions for sustainable AI deployment.

### [169] [DualHash: A Stochastic Primal-Dual Algorithm with Theoretical Guarantee for Deep Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18218)
*Luxuan Li,Xiao Wang,Chunfeng Cui*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: DualHash is a stochastic primal-dual hashing algorithm that provides rigorous complexity bounds for deep hashing by transforming W-type regularization optimization into dual space with closed-form proximal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hashing methods directly optimize W-type regularizations without convergence guarantees, and the coupling between these regularizers and neural network outputs creates composite forms lacking closed-form proximal solutions.

Method: Uses Fenchel duality to partially transform nonconvex W-type regularization optimization into dual space, resulting in proximal operators with closed-form solutions. Develops two algorithm instances: momentum-accelerated version and improved version using variance reduction.

Result: Achieves superior performance on three image retrieval databases. Provides complexity bounds of O(ε⁻⁴) for momentum-accelerated version and O(ε⁻³) for variance-reduced version.

Conclusion: DualHash offers a principled approach to deep hashing with rigorous convergence guarantees and improved efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Deep hashing converts high-dimensional feature vectors into compact binary
codes, enabling efficient large-scale retrieval. A fundamental challenge in
deep hashing stems from the discrete nature of quantization in generating the
codes. W-type regularizations, such as $||z|-1|$, have been proven effective as
they encourage variables toward binary values. However, existing methods often
directly optimize these regularizations without convergence guarantees. While
proximal gradient methods offer a promising solution, the coupling between
W-type regularizers and neural network outputs results in composite forms that
generally lack closed-form proximal solutions. In this paper, we present a
stochastic primal-dual hashing algorithm, referred to as DualHash, that
provides rigorous complexity bounds. Using Fenchel duality, we partially
transform the nonconvex W-type regularization optimization into the dual space,
which results in a proximal operator that admits closed-form solutions. We
derive two algorithm instances: a momentum-accelerated version with
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ complexity and an improved
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ version using variance reduction. Experiments
on three image retrieval databases demonstrate the superior performance of
DualHash.

*Minfeng Qi,Zhongmin Cao,Qin Wang,Ningran Li,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs have accelerated submission cycles, increased linguistic complexity, and expanded AI-related topics in preprints, acting as selective catalysts rather than universal disruptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide systematic evidence of how LLMs reshape scientific publishing, addressing the gap between speculation and limited empirical data.

Method: Large-scale analysis of 2.1 million preprints (2016-2025) using multi-level framework with interrupted time-series models, collaboration metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling across four major repositories.

Result: LLMs accelerated submission/revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, with computationally intensive fields benefiting more.

Conclusion: LLMs act as selective catalysts amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides, highlighting need for governance frameworks to preserve trust and fairness in AI-enabled research.

Abstract: Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly
communication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and
evaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs)
introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are
written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs
reshape scientific publishing remains limited.
  This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1
million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major
repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a
multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series
models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic
modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary
orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and
revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and
disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive
fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as
universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths
and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper
provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of
generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance
frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled
research ecosystem.

### [171] [Are LLMs Court-Ready? Evaluating Frontier Models on Indian Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17900)
*Kush Juvekar,Arghya Bhattacharya,Sai Khadloya,Utkarsh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper establishes India's first jurisdiction-specific benchmark for evaluating LLMs in legal workflows using public legal examinations as a proxy, revealing that while frontier LLMs perform well on objective tests, they fall short in long-form legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of jurisdiction-specific frameworks to assess LLM competence in legal workflows, particularly for India's legal system, as LLMs are increasingly being integrated into legal practice.

Method: Used India's public legal examinations as a transparent proxy, assembling multi-year objective screens from national and state exams, and conducted a lawyer-graded, paired-blinded study of long-form answers from the Supreme Court's Advocate-on-Record exam.

Result: Frontier LLMs consistently clear historical cutoffs and match/exceed recent top-scorer bands on objective exams, but none surpass human toppers on long-form reasoning. Identified three reliability failure modes: procedural/format compliance, authority/citation discipline, and forum-appropriate voice/structure.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist with checks, cross-statute consistency, and statute/precedent lookups, but human leadership remains essential for forum-specific drafting, procedural strategy, reconciling authorities/exceptions, and ethical judgment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are entering legal workflows, yet we lack a
jurisdiction-specific framework to assess their baseline competence therein. We
use India's public legal examinations as a transparent proxy. Our multi-year
benchmark assembles objective screens from top national and state exams and
evaluates open and frontier LLMs under real-world exam conditions. To probe
beyond multiple-choice questions, we also include a lawyer-graded,
paired-blinded study of long-form answers from the Supreme Court's
Advocate-on-Record exam. This is, to our knowledge, the first exam-grounded,
India-specific yardstick for LLM court-readiness released with datasets and
protocols. Our work shows that while frontier systems consistently clear
historical cutoffs and often match or exceed recent top-scorer bands on
objective exams, none surpasses the human topper on long-form reasoning. Grader
notes converge on three reliability failure modes: procedural or format
compliance, authority or citation discipline, and forum-appropriate voice and
structure. These findings delineate where LLMs can assist (checks,
cross-statute consistency, statute and precedent lookups) and where human
leadership remains essential: forum-specific drafting and filing, procedural
and relief strategy, reconciling authorities and exceptions, and ethical,
accountable judgment.

### [172] [Interpretability Framework for LLMs in Undergraduate Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17910)
*Sagnik Dakshit,Sushmita Sinha Roy*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: A novel interpretability framework for analyzing LLM-generated solutions in mathematics education, focusing on reasoning process quality rather than just final answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation methods focus only on final answer accuracy and overlook the reasoning process quality, reliability, and pedagogical validity of LLM solutions in mathematics.

Method: Combines reasoning flow extraction, semantic labeling of operations/concepts, and prompt ablation analysis to assess input salience and output stability using structured metrics like reasoning complexity, phrase sensitivity, and robustness.

Result: LLMs often produce syntactically fluent but conceptually flawed solutions, with reasoning patterns sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variation, as demonstrated on real Calculus I-III university exams.

Conclusion: The framework enables fine-grained diagnosis of reasoning failures, supports curriculum alignment, and informs interpretable AI-assisted feedback tools, providing a foundation for transparent and responsible AI deployment in STEM education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in education, yet
their correctness alone does not capture the quality, reliability, or
pedagogical validity of their problem-solving behavior, especially in
mathematics, where multistep logic, symbolic reasoning, and conceptual clarity
are critical. Conventional evaluation methods largely focus on final answer
accuracy and overlook the reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce
a novel interpretability framework for analyzing LLM-generated solutions using
undergraduate calculus problems as a representative domain. Our approach
combines reasoning flow extraction and decomposing solutions into semantically
labeled operations and concepts with prompt ablation analysis to assess input
salience and output stability. Using structured metrics such as reasoning
complexity, phrase sensitivity, and robustness, we evaluated the model behavior
on real Calculus I to III university exams. Our findings revealed that LLMs
often produce syntactically fluent yet conceptually flawed solutions, with
reasoning patterns sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variation. This
framework enables fine-grained diagnosis of reasoning failures, supports
curriculum alignment, and informs the design of interpretable AI-assisted
feedback tools. This is the first study to offer a structured, quantitative,
and pedagogically grounded framework for interpreting LLM reasoning in
mathematics education, laying the foundation for the transparent and
responsible deployment of AI in STEM learning environments.

*Amirkia Rafiei Oskooei,Mehmet S. Aktas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BreakFun is a jailbreak attack that exploits LLMs' adherence to structured schemas by using a Trojan Schema to force harmful content generation, achieving high success rates across multiple models, with a proposed defense using adversarial prompt deconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs' proficiency in processing structured data and following syntactic rules makes them vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, turning their core strengths into weaknesses.

Method: BreakFun uses a three-part prompt combining innocent framing, Chain-of-Thought distraction, and a Trojan Schema - a carefully crafted data structure that exploits LLMs' tendency to follow structures to generate harmful content.

Result: The attack achieved 89% average success rate across 13 foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, with 100% Attack Success Rate on several prominent models. Ablation study confirmed the Trojan Schema is the primary causal factor.

Conclusion: LLMs' core strengths in structured data processing can be turned into critical vulnerabilities. The proposed Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail shows high efficacy as a defense, validating that targeting deceptive schemas is a viable mitigation strategy for building more robustly aligned models.

Abstract: The proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing structured data
and adhering to syntactic rules is a capability that drives their widespread
adoption but also makes them paradoxically vulnerable. In this paper, we
investigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that
weaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a
three-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought
distraction with a core "Trojan Schema"--a carefully crafted data structure
that compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong
tendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is
highly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13
foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100%
Attack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation
study confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To
counter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a
defense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a "Literal
Transcription"--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the
user's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high
efficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is
a viable mitigation strategy. Our work provides a look into how an LLM's core
strengths can be turned into critical weaknesses, offering a fresh perspective
for building more robustly aligned models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PLAGUE is a novel plug-and-play framework for multi-turn jailbreaking attacks on LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 81.4% on OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly susceptible to jailbreaking in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be subtly injected across conversations, but existing multi-turn attacks face challenges in adaptability, efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: PLAGUE dissects multi-turn attacks into three phases (Primer, Planner, Finisher) inspired by lifelong-learning agents, enabling systematic exploration of multi-turn attack strategies with plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning.

Result: PLAGUE improves attack success rates by more than 30% across leading models with comparable query budget, achieving 81.4% ASR on OpenAI o3 and 67.3% on Claude Opus 4.1.

Conclusion: The framework provides tools and insights for comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation, demonstrating the importance of plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning in crafting effective multi-turn attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. With the
advent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode
of interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM
capabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to
jailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be
subtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While
single-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency
and effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn
counterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play
framework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning
agents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three
carefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a
systematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family.
Evaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve
state-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by
more than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget.
Particularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on
OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered
highly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and
insights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context
optimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a
comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation.

### [175] [Position: LLM Watermarking Should Align Stakeholders' Incentives for Practical Adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18333)
*Yepeng Liu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Gregory W. Wornell,Yuheng Bu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLM watermarking faces adoption barriers due to misaligned incentives among stakeholders. In-context watermarking (ICW) offers a promising approach by aligning incentives: trusted parties embed hidden instructions, users experience no quality loss, and LLM providers remain neutral.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of LLM watermarking remains limited due to misaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, creating barriers like competitive risk, detection-tool governance, robustness concerns, and attribution issues.

Method: Analyzes three watermarking classes through incentive alignment lens: model watermarking, LLM text watermarking, and in-context watermarking (ICW). ICW enables trusted parties to embed hidden watermarking instructions into documents, which when processed by LLMs produce detectable watermarks indicating misuse.

Result: Identifies that ICW naturally aligns stakeholder incentives - users experience no quality degradation, trusted parties gain detection capability, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following instructions. This approach is particularly suitable for domains with trusted parties like conference organizers or educators.

Conclusion: Practical adoption of LLM watermarking requires aligning stakeholder incentives in targeted application domains and fostering community engagement. ICW serves as an example of incentive-aligned, domain-specific watermarking that can enable reliable misuse detection while maintaining user experience.

Abstract: Despite progress in watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs),
real-world deployment remains limited. We argue that this gap stems from
misaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, which
manifest as four key barriers: competitive risk, detection-tool governance,
robustness concerns and attribution issues. We revisit three classes of
watermarking through this lens. \emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with
LLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems.
\emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely
as an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such
as dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \emph{In-context
watermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference
organizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into
documents. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the
output carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns
incentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection
tool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark
instructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned
methods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable
tools to detect misuse. More broadly, we distill design principles for
incentive-aligned, domain-specific watermarking and outline future research
directions. Our position is that the practical adoption of LLM watermarking
requires aligning stakeholder incentives in targeted application domains and
fostering active community engagement.

*Xin Li,Jingzhi Hu,Yinghui He,Hongbo Wang,Jin Gan,Jun Luo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: WiAnchor is a training framework for Wi-Fi-based multi-person human activity recognition that enables efficient cross-domain adaptation even when some activity categories are unavailable during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi HAR struggles with multi-person scenarios due to coarse spatial resolution, and cross-domain adaptation is challenging when certain activity categories are missing during fine-tuning due to subject-specific near-field signal characteristics.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Pre-training with enlarged inter-class feature margins for better activity separability; 2) Fine-tuning with anchor matching mechanism that filters subject-specific interference using incomplete activity categories; 3) Recognition improvement based on feature-level similarity with anchors.

Result: Achieved over 90% cross-domain accuracy with absent activity categories on a comprehensive dataset.

Conclusion: WiAnchor effectively addresses the challenge of cross-domain adaptation in multi-person Wi-Fi HAR when activity categories are incomplete, demonstrating robust performance through its novel anchor-based approach.

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides substantial convenience
and has emerged as a thriving research field, yet the coarse spatial resolution
inherent to Wi-Fi significantly hinders its ability to distinguish multiple
subjects. By exploiting the near-field domination effect, establishing a
dedicated sensing link for each subject through their personal Wi-Fi device
offers a promising solution for multi-person HAR under native traffic. However,
due to the subject-specific characteristics and irregular patterns of
near-field signals, HAR neural network models require fine-tuning (FT) for
cross-domain adaptation, which becomes particularly challenging with certain
categories unavailable. In this paper, we propose WiAnchor, a novel training
framework for efficient cross-domain adaptation in the presence of incomplete
activity categories. This framework processes Wi-Fi signals embedded with
irregular time information in three steps: during pre-training, we enlarge
inter-class feature margins to enhance the separability of activities; in the
FT stage, we innovate an anchor matching mechanism for cross-domain adaptation,
filtering subject-specific interference informed by incomplete activity
categories, rather than attempting to extract complete features from them;
finally, the recognition of input samples is further improved based on their
feature-level similarity with anchors. We construct a comprehensive dataset to
thoroughly evaluate WiAnchor, achieving over 90% cross-domain accuracy with
absent activity categories.

*Binyu Tan,Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Kaidi Xu,Heng Tao Shen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Fumin Shen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes Conformal Lesion Segmentation (CLS), a risk-constrained framework that uses conformal prediction to calibrate data-driven thresholds, ensuring test-time false negative rate (FNR) remains below target tolerance with statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models use fixed thresholds without statistical guarantees on false negative rates, undermining reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical applications like 3D lesion segmentation.

Method: CLS holds out a calibration set to analyze threshold settings under FNR tolerance, defines FNR-specific loss function, identifies critical thresholds, and determines approximate 1-α quantile as test-time confidence threshold using conformal prediction.

Result: Validated on six 3D-LS datasets across five backbone models, CLS provides rigorous FNR constraint while yielding more precise and reliable segmentations with statistical soundness.

Conclusion: CLS enables deployment of risk-aware segmentation in clinical practice by generalizing statistical regularities from calibration data to new test data with guaranteed FNR control.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation serves as a critical component of precision
medicine, enabling accurate localization and delineation of pathological
regions, such as lesions. However, existing models empirically apply fixed
thresholds (e.g., 0.5) to differentiate lesions from the background, offering
no statistical guarantees on key metrics such as the false negative rate (FNR).
This lack of principled risk control undermines their reliable deployment in
high-stakes clinical applications, especially in challenging scenarios like 3D
lesion segmentation (3D-LS). To address this issue, we propose a
risk-constrained framework, termed Conformal Lesion Segmentation (CLS), that
calibrates data-driven thresholds via conformalization to ensure the test-time
FNR remains below a target tolerance $\varepsilon$ under desired risk levels.
CLS begins by holding out a calibration set to analyze the threshold setting
for each sample under the FNR tolerance, drawing on the idea of conformal
prediction. We define an FNR-specific loss function and identify the critical
threshold at which each calibration data point just satisfies the target
tolerance. Given a user-specified risk level $\alpha$, we then determine the
approximate $1-\alpha$ quantile of all the critical thresholds in the
calibration set as the test-time confidence threshold. By conformalizing such
critical thresholds, CLS generalizes the statistical regularities observed in
the calibration set to new test data, providing rigorous FNR constraint while
yielding more precise and reliable segmentations. We validate the statistical
soundness and predictive performance of CLS on six 3D-LS datasets across five
backbone models, and conclude with actionable insights for deploying risk-aware
segmentation in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formalization of a subject-event ontology for modeling dynamic systems without global time, using event fixation, causal ordering, and declarative dataflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex dynamic systems without relying on global time, addressing distributed systems, microservices, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios.

Method: Proposes nine axioms (A1-A9) for executable ontologies, including event fixation by subjects, causal ordering via happens-before, declarative dataflow mechanism, model-based validation, and automatic causal chain construction.

Result: Developed a formal framework with monotonicity of history, acyclicity of causality, and traceability properties. Implemented in the boldsea system workflow engine using BSL language.

Conclusion: The subject-event ontology provides a deterministic, model-based approach for distributed systems that eliminates global time dependency and handles conflicting perspectives from different subjects.

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMaRT framework integrates multiple reasoning strategies in LLMs to achieve superior performance across diverse tasks, outperforming single-strategy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the benefits of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy works universally, creating a need for frameworks that fuse multiple strategies for better performance and robustness.

Method: SMaRT (Select, Mix, and ReinvenT) framework uses LLMs as intelligent integrators rather than just evaluators, seamlessly combining diverse reasoning strategies to create balanced and efficient solutions.

Result: Extensive evaluations across reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making benchmarks show SMaRT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics.

Conclusion: SMaRT redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing self-refining methodologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with
exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements,
state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy
of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally,
highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize
performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT
(SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome
this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the
seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods,
which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent
integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive
empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential
decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution
quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines
LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy
calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing
the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Saber is a training-free sampling algorithm for diffusion language models that improves code generation by adaptively accelerating inference and adding backtracking mechanisms, achieving 1.9% accuracy improvement and 251.4% speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models show promise for code generation but suffer from a critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality, with performance collapsing when accelerating generation by reducing sampling steps.

Method: Saber uses adaptive acceleration based on established code context and incorporates backtracking mechanisms to reverse generated tokens, enabling efficient sampling without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments show Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by 1.9% average improvement over mainstream DLM sampling methods while achieving 251.4% average inference speedup.

Conclusion: Saber significantly narrows the performance gap between diffusion language models and autoregressive models in code generation by leveraging DLMs' inherent advantages.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

Conclusion: Probabilistic intent modeling can contribute to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents by enabling better adaptation to partner intentions in dialogue.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent

slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute
to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery

both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward

TL;DR: A federated unlearning approach for LLMs that handles continuous, heterogeneous unlearning needs while preserving privacy and maintaining model utility through task-specific adapter learning and hierarchical merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, security concerns and need to remove undesirable knowledge from LLMs in real-world applications, while dealing with challenges of continuous heterogeneous unlearning needs and decentralized sensitive data with asymmetric access.

Method: Proposes federated unlearning approach that decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning, and employs hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enable robust unlearning updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU benchmarks showed effective handling of heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed federated unlearning approach successfully addresses practical unlearning challenges in LLMs, providing scalable and privacy-preserving solution for continuous heterogeneous unlearning needs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

*Howard Chen,Noam Razin,Karthik Narasimhan,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL causes less catastrophic forgetting than SFT in language model post-training while achieving similar or better target task performance, due to RL's mode-seeking nature from on-policy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate catastrophic forgetting in language model post-training by systematically comparing forgetting patterns between SFT and RL methods.

Method: Systematic comparison of SFT and RL across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, arithmetic reasoning), plus theoretical analysis modeling LM as mixture distribution and investigating on-policy data effects.

Result: RL consistently leads to less forgetting than SFT while maintaining comparable or higher target task performance. The robustness stems from RL's mode-seeking nature using on-policy data, not KL regularization or advantage estimation.

Conclusion: On-policy data is key to mitigating forgetting in post-training, and approximately on-policy data offers a practical efficient alternative to fully on-policy data.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

*Jaihoon Kim,Rajarshi Saha,Minhyuk Sung,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TM outperforms FM when target distributions have well-separated modes and non-negligible variances, due to TM's stochastic latent updates preserving target covariance that FM underestimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why Transition Matching (TM) achieves higher quality with fewer sampling steps than Flow Matching (FM), given recent results showing TM's superiority.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing TM and FM: (1) Prove TM achieves strictly lower KL divergence for unimodal Gaussian distributions with finite steps, (2) Characterize convergence rates under fixed compute budget, (3) Extend analysis to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes.

Result: TM attains faster convergence and lower KL divergence than FM in unimodal Gaussian settings. For Gaussian mixtures, TM outperforms FM when modes are well-separated and variances are non-negligible. Performance advantage diminishes as target variance approaches zero.

Conclusion: TM is superior to FM when target distributions have well-separated modes and non-negligible variances, validated by theoretical analysis and experiments on Gaussian distributions and real-world image/video generation tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

TL;DR: Customized-GRPO addresses the fidelity-editability trade-off in subject-driven image generation by introducing Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping and Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting to overcome competitive degradation in naive GRPO applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability), and naive GRPO applications lead to competitive degradation due to conflicting gradient signals and misalignment with diffusion process dynamics.

Method: Proposes Customized-GRPO with two innovations: Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS) to penalize conflicted reward signals and amplify synergistic ones, and Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW) to align optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation and achieving superior balance between identity preservation and prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Customized-GRPO effectively resolves the fidelity-editability trade-off by providing sharper gradient signals and temporal alignment, generating images that preserve key identity features while accurately following complex textual prompts.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles provide strong uncertainty quantification but have high computational and memory costs that limit scalability to large models, creating a need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: Prune attention heads in transformers to create diverse ensemble members, then merge them using a new multi-head attention mechanism with grouped fully-connected layers to create a compact model.

Result: Achieves inference speed close to a single network while matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in uncertainty quantification performance without retraining from scratch. Shows consistent gains across image and text classification tasks, and surpasses state-of-the-art in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles provides an efficient alternative to Deep Ensembles for uncertainty quantification, maintaining strong performance while significantly reducing computational costs, with particularly impressive results in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

Motivation: Early detection of cardiovascular diseases through wearable sensors requires robust, efficient analysis. Deep learning can automate interpretation but needs to work on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Convolutional neural network with early fusion of synchronized ECG and PCG data, trained on Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset for binary classification.

Result: Reduced memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive accuracy. On-device inference is more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Conclusion: Feasible to deploy deep learning models on medical edge devices for cardiovascular monitoring, enabling efficient on-device inference without continuous data transmission.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

TL;DR: CodeRL+ integrates execution semantics alignment into RLVR training for code generation, enabling models to infer variable-level execution trajectory for better alignment between code text and execution semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap between LLMs' textual pattern training and functional correctness governed by formal execution semantics, overcoming limitations of binary pass/fail signals in RLVR approaches.

Method: Proposes CodeRL+ that constructs execution semantics alignment using existing on-policy rollouts, enabling inference of variable-level execution trajectory and integrating seamlessly with various RL algorithms.

Result: Achieves 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1, 15.5% higher accuracy on code-reasoning, and 4.4% higher accuracy on test-output-generation benchmarks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CodeRL+ effectively bridges the semantic gap between code text and execution semantics, generalizes well across coding tasks and models, and strengthens alignment between textual representations and underlying execution semantics.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from
vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on
textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by
formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from
executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is
inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual
representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle
logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel
approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training
pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level
execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution
semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using
existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL
algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms
post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6%
average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to
other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning
and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong
applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe
analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment
between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.

TL;DR: CUARewardBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating reward models on computer-using agents, addressing limitations of script-based verifiers through systematic assessment of outcome and process reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Script-based verifiers for computer-using agents have limited scalability and lack step-wise assessment capabilities. Reward models offer promising alternatives but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains underexplored.

Method: Created CUARewardBench with trajectories from 10 software categories and 7 agent architectures, expert annotations, and proposed Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE) method using strict unanimous voting and strategic prompt configurations.

Result: UPE achieves 89.8% precision and 93.3% NPV for outcome reward models, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for process reward models, significantly outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: CUARewardBench enables systematic evaluation of CUA reward models, reveals critical limitations of current approaches, and demonstrates that UPE substantially enhances reward model reliability for both outcome and process assessment.

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs) enable task completion through natural
interaction with operating systems and software interfaces. While script-based
verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited
scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer
promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains
largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench,
comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward
Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward
models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic
assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse,
Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10
software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels
(25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through
carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure
reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and
Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3
prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including
insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the
superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation.
(4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our
comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that
significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting
and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and
93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially
outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV-based MOT faces unique challenges including unpredictable object motion, frequent occlusions, limited appearance cues, and abrupt UAV movements, which cause unreliable trajectory estimation and identity switches. Conventional motion models fail to capture both linear and non-linear dynamics effectively.

Method: Proposes DMTrack with three key components: DeformMamba (deformable state-space predictor for adaptive trajectory modeling), MotionGate (lightweight gating module fusing Kalman and Mamba predictions), and uncertainty-aware association strategy for identity preservation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks in identity consistency and tracking accuracy, particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Operates without appearance models while maintaining competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: DMTrack provides a practical and robust solution for UAV-based tracking by effectively handling motion uncertainties and maintaining identity consistency without relying on appearance features.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents
unique challenges due to unpredictable object motion, frequent occlusions, and
limited appearance cues inherent to aerial viewpoints. These issues are further
exacerbated by abrupt UAV movements, leading to unreliable trajectory
estimation and identity switches. Conventional motion models, such as Kalman
filters or static sequence encoders, often fall short in capturing both linear
and non-linear dynamics under such conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose DMTrack, a deformable motion tracking framework tailored for UAV-based
MOT. Our DMTrack introduces three key components: DeformMamba, a deformable
state-space predictor that dynamically aggregates historical motion states for
adaptive trajectory modeling; MotionGate, a lightweight gating module that
fuses Kalman and Mamba predictions based on motion context and uncertainty; and
an uncertainty-aware association strategy that enhances identity preservation
by aligning motion trends with prediction confidence. Extensive experiments on
the VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTrack achieves
state-of-the-art performance in identity consistency and tracking accuracy,
particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Importantly, our method
operates without appearance models and maintains competitive efficiency,
highlighting its practicality for robust UAV-based tracking.
