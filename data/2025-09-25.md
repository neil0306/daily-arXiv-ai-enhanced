### [1] [Automated Item Neutralization for Non-Cognitive Scales: A Large Language Model Approach to Reducing Social-Desirability Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19314)
*Sirui Wu,Daijin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-assisted item neutralization reduces social desirability bias in personality tests, showing preserved reliability but inconsistent bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address social desirability bias in personality assessments using AI technology to create more neutral test items.

Method: Used GPT-3 to rewrite IPIP-BFM-50 personality items, then compared original vs neutralized versions with 203 participants using social desirability scales.

Result: Neutralized items preserved reliability and factor structure, reduced bias for some items but inconsistently, and showed configural but not metric/scalar invariance.

Conclusion: AI neutralization is a promising but imperfect method for reducing social desirability bias in personality assessment.

Abstract: This study evaluates item neutralization assisted by the large language model
(LLM) to reduce social desirability bias in personality assessment. GPT-o3 was
used to rewrite the International Personality Item Pool Big Five Measure
(IPIP-BFM-50), and 203 participants completed either the original or
neutralized form along with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. The
results showed preserved reliability and a five-factor structure, with gains in
Conscientiousness and declines in Agreeableness and Openness. The correlations
with social desirability decreased for several items, but inconsistently.
Configural invariance held, though metric and scalar invariance failed.
Findings support AI neutralization as a potential but imperfect bias-reduction
method.

### [2] [FHIR-AgentBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents for Realistic Interoperable EHR Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19319)
*Gyubok Lee,Elea Bach,Eric Yang,Tom Pollard,Alistair Johnson,Edward Choi,Yugang jia,Jong Ha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FHIR-AgentBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on clinical data using the HL7 FHIR standard, addressing the gap in realistic evaluation methods for interoperable clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to HL7 FHIR standard in healthcare requires LLM agents to handle complex, resource-based data models, but existing benchmarks lack realism for evaluating recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data.

Method: The benchmark grounds 2,931 real-world clinical questions in HL7 FHIR and systematically evaluates agentic frameworks by comparing data retrieval strategies (direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns (single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs. code generation).

Result: Experiments reveal practical challenges in retrieving data from complex FHIR resources and reasoning over them, which significantly impact question answering performance.

Conclusion: FHIR-AgentBench is publicly released to promote reproducible research and development of robust LLM agents for clinical applications.

Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for
clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data
models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing
benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to
evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical
questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically
evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies
(direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns
(single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs.
code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of
retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning
over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We
publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite
(https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research
and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.

### [3] [Readme_AI: Dynamic Context Construction for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19322)
*Millie Vyas,Timothy Blattner,Alden Dima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A specification called Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) that dynamically builds context for LLMs using data source metadata to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often provide inaccurate or unreliable information for specific queries despite extensive training, and query-specific context significantly improves response usefulness.

Method: Data source owners create metadata files that LLMs use for reasoning. The protocol supports extensible types including web-page crawling, data repository fetching, publication parsing, and general text, with context formatted using user-specified tags.

Result: The prototype successfully enabled LLMs to provide accurate responses about the NIST Hedgehog library, generating relevant code examples that previously resulted in hallucinations and irrelevant information.

Conclusion: The primary contribution is an extensible protocol for dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, which enhances LLM responses and reduces hallucinations.

Abstract: Despite being trained on significant amounts of data, Large Language Models
(LLMs) can provide inaccurate or unreliable information in the context of a
user's specific query. Given query-specific context significantly improves the
usefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can
be used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner
creates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about
dataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created
a prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the
metadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some
features that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that
represent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading
and parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and
grouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for
the LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this
early prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,
for which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses
containing hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that
it is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code
interpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by
Hedgehog's developer. Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for
dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing
responses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations. The source code for the
Readme_AI tool is posted here: https://github.com/usnistgov/readme_ai .

### [4] [Magnitude Matters: a Superior Class of Similarity Metrics for Holistic Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19323)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes two new magnitude-aware similarity metrics (Overlap Similarity and Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity) that outperform traditional dot product and cosine similarity for paraphrase and inference tasks, while identifying limitations for compositional semantics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector comparison standards (dot product and cosine similarity) have limitations - dot product is unbounded and sensitive to vector norms, while cosine similarity discards magnitude information entirely. The paper aims to develop better metrics that integrate both magnitude and alignment.

Method: Introduced two parameter-free metrics: Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS). Conducted comprehensive evaluation using four state-of-the-art sentence embedding models across eight NLP benchmarks, with statistical significance testing using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Result: Both OS and HTS provided statistically significant improvement in Mean Squared Error over dot product and cosine similarity for paraphrase and inference tasks across all embedding models. No significant improvement was found for compositional semantics tasks (SICK, STS-B).

Conclusion: Magnitude-aware metrics offer superior performance for holistic semantic understanding tasks like paraphrase and inference, but compositional text representation remains a distinct challenge requiring future research.

Abstract: Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is
dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and
sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude
information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and
rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity
metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic
Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment
in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and
generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four
state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2,
all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across
a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora,
and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my
results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding
(paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant
improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine
similarity, regardless of the underlying embedding model.Crucially, my findings
delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks
requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my
magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This
significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly
nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of
representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for
future work.

### [5] [How Much of Your Data Can Suck? Thresholds for Domain Performance and Emergent Misalignment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19325)
*Jian Ouyang,Arman T,Ge Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on incorrect data causes emergent misalignment, with performance degradation starting at just 10-25% incorrect data. Models need at least 50% correct data to recover performance but never match base model safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes domains (finance, coding, law, health), but fine-tuning on incorrect data can lead to harmful outputs and safety risks.

Method: Evaluated gpt-4o models fine-tuned with varying ratios (10-90% correct) of obviously and subtly incorrect data across four domains: coding, finance, health, and legal.

Result: Even 10-25% incorrect data dramatically degrades performance. Models require ≥50% correct data for recovery but never achieve base model's robustness (which had perfect alignment and zero dangerous completions).

Conclusion: Incorrect data has heavy costs, emphasizing need for extremely high-quality data curation or using robust base models without unnecessary fine-tuning for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of incorrect data on the performance and
safety of large language models (LLMs), specifically gpt-4o, during supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Although LLMs become increasingly vital across broad domains
like finance, coding, law, and health, fine-tuning on incorrect data can lead
to "emergent misalignment," producing harmful or deceptive outputs unrelated to
the intended task. We evaluate gpt-4o models fine-tuned with varying ratios
(10\% to 90\% correct) of both obviously and subtly incorrect data across four
domains: coding, finance, health, and legal. Our findings show that even modest
amounts of incorrect data (10-25\%) dramatically degrade domain performance and
not moral alignment. A clear threshold of at least 50\% correct data is needed
for models to consistently recover strong performance, though they rarely match
the robustness and safety of the base model, which exhibits near-perfect
alignment and zero dangerous completions out-of-the-box. This research
emphasizes that the cost of incorrect data is heavy, highlighting the critical
need for extremely high-quality data curation or, alternatively, leveraging
robust base models without unnecessary fine-tuning for high-stakes
applications.

### [6] [Unveiling the Merits and Defects of LLMs in Automatic Review Generation for Scientific Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19326)
*Ruochi Li,Haoxuan Zhang,Edward Gehringer,Ting Xiao,Junhua Ding,Haihua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate structured reviews but struggle with critical reasoning and quality sensitivity. GPT-4o produces more descriptive content but significantly fewer weaknesses compared to human reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of scientific submissions strains traditional peer-review, prompting exploration of LLMs for automated review generation.

Method: Proposed evaluation framework using semantic similarity and knowledge graph metrics on a benchmark of 1,683 papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR/NeurIPS, testing 5 LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform well in descriptive content (GPT-4o generates 15.74% more entities in strengths) but underperform in weaknesses (59.42% fewer entities) and quality sensitivity (only 5.7% increase in node count vs 50% in human reviews).

Conclusion: LLMs have merits for descriptive reviewing but significant limitations in critical analysis, providing empirical foundation for future LLM-assisted reviewing tools.

Abstract: The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the
traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language
models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate
competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for
critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains
limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and
structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against
human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683
papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and
generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in
descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and
methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative
example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths
section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in
identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback
based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real
reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to
weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed
across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for
understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the
development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools. Data, code, and more
detailed results are publicly available at

### [7] [A systematic review of trial-matching pipelines using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19327)
*Braxton A. Morrison,Madhumita Sushil,Jacob S. Young*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic review of LLM-based approaches for clinical trial matching (2020-2025) showing GPT-4 consistently outperforms other models, with key challenges including data access, cost, hallucinations, and bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual clinical trial matching is labor-intensive and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. LLM-based pipelines offer a promising automated solution.

Method: Systematic review of 31 studies from 126 unique articles, analyzing different matching approaches (patient-to-criterion, patient-to-trial, trial-to-patient, binary eligibility) and data types (synthetic vs real patient data).

Result: GPT-4 consistently outperformed other models in matching and eligibility extraction, though at higher cost. Promising strategies include zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller models for privacy.

Conclusion: Standardized metrics, realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness are critical for broader deployment of LLMs in clinical trial matching.

Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trial options is critical for identifying novel
treatments, especially in oncology. However, manual matching is labor-intensive
and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large
language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic
review of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases
and one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial
matching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies
focused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only
(n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only
(n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real
patient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics
limited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the
GPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in
matching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising
strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o
model, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models
for data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital
infrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently
large real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as
reducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This
review synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching,
highlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics,
more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be
critical for broader deployment.

### [8] [How Model Size, Temperature, and Prompt Style Affect LLM-Human Assessment Score Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19329)
*Julie Jung,Max Lu,Sina Chole Benker,Dogus Darici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model size is the key factor affecting LLM-human alignment in clinical reasoning assessment, with temperature and prompt style having less impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different factors (model size, temperature, prompt style) affect the alignment between LLMs and human assessments in clinical reasoning skills.

Method: Examined how model size, temperature, and prompt style influence LLM alignment within itself, between models, and with human evaluations of clinical reasoning.

Result: Model size emerged as the primary factor influencing LLM-human score alignment, while temperature and prompt style had relatively minor effects.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of checking alignments across multiple levels when using LLMs for clinical reasoning assessment.

Abstract: We examined how model size, temperature, and prompt style affect Large
Language Models' (LLMs) alignment within itself, between models, and with human
in assessing clinical reasoning skills. Model size emerged as a key factor in
LLM-human score alignment. Study highlights the importance of checking
alignments across multiple levels.

### [9] [Quantifying Compositionality of Classic and State-of-the-Art Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19332)
*Zhijin Guo,Chenhao Xue,Zhaozhen Xu,Hongbo Bo,Yuxuan Ye,Janet B. Pierrehumbert,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-step evaluation framework to quantify additive compositionality in language models, tracking compositional signals across training stages and model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA generative transformer models lack proper limits on meaning shifts due to context, while static embeddings made excessive claims about compositionality. The paper aims to provide a formal way to measure how well models exploit compositional meanings for generalization.

Method: A two-step evaluation: (1) measures linearity between entity attributes and embeddings via canonical correlation analysis, (2) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing embeddings for unseen attribute combinations using metrics like L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy.

Result: Stronger compositional signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in deeper layers of transformer-based models before a decline at the top layer. The method captures failure cases where linear composition breaks down.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully quantifies compositionality across different data types and model architectures, revealing important patterns in how compositional understanding develops during training and across model layers.

Abstract: For language models to generalize correctly to novel expressions, it is
critical that they exploit access compositional meanings when this is
justified. Even if we don't know what a "pelp" is, we can use our knowledge of
numbers to understand that "ten pelps" makes more pelps than "two pelps".
Static word embeddings such as Word2vec made strong, indeed excessive, claims
about compositionality. The SOTA generative, transformer models and graph
models, however, go too far in the other direction by providing no real limits
on shifts in meaning due to context. To quantify the additive compositionality,
we formalize a two-step, generalized evaluation that (i) measures the linearity
between known entity attributes and their embeddings via canonical correlation
analysis, and (ii) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing
embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction
metrics such as L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy. These
metrics also capture failure cases where linear composition breaks down.
Sentences, knowledge graphs, and word embeddings are evaluated and tracked the
compositionality across all layers and training stages. Stronger compositional
signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in
deeper layers of the transformer-based model before a decline at the top layer.

### [10] [Pluralistic Off-policy Evaluation and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19333)
*Chengkai Huang,Junda Wu,Zhouhang Xie,Yu Xia,Rui Wang,Tong Yu,Subrata Mitra,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POPE is a framework for offline pluralistic preference evaluation and alignment in LLMs that combines collaborative utility and diversity components to capture pluralistic human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment methods focus solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism, and most datasets are logged under policies that differ from evaluated LLMs, making off-policy evaluation for pluralistic preferences an open challenge.

Method: POPE includes a unified reward function combining collaborative utility from human preference signals and diversity using entropy-based coverage measures. It uses decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators to separately evaluate relevance and diversity from logged interactions.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows decomposed IPS estimators establish a lower bound on variance. Empirical results demonstrate POPE efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation while maintaining models' general capabilities on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: POPE enables effective off-policy evaluation and optimization for pluralistic preference alignment in LLMs, addressing the gap in existing methods that ignore preference diversity.

Abstract: Personalized preference alignment for LLMs with diverse human preferences
requires evaluation and alignment methods that capture pluralism. Most existing
preference alignment datasets are logged under policies that differ
substantially from the evaluated LLMs, and existing off-policy estimators focus
solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism. Extending
Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore,
remains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy
Evaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference
evaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that
combines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference
signals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component
inspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic
alignment. Furthermore, to estimate this reward from logged interactions, we
derive decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators that separately
evaluate relevance and diversity. Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed
IPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance. With the off-policy
evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to
further enhance pluralistic alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that POPE
efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation and maintains the models'
general capabilities on downstream tasks

### [11] [Cognitive-Level Adaptive Generation via Capability-Aware Retrieval and Style Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19336)
*Qingsong Wang,Tao Wu,Wang Lin,Yueying Feng,Gongsheng Yuan,Chang Yao,Jingyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLAF, a framework that addresses cognitive misalignment in LLMs by adapting content complexity and presentation style to users' cognitive levels using hierarchical knowledge graphs and Bloom's taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to adapt content to users with different cognitive capacities, leading to knowledge-level and presentation-style misalignment that hinders effective comprehension.

Method: CLAF integrates capability-aware retrieval using hierarchical knowledge graphs, style optimization guided by Bloom's taxonomy and preference learning, and knowledge-controllable generation for consistency.

Result: Empirical results show CLAF enhances LLM adaptability and informativeness across diverse user profiles, providing robust cognitive-level alignment.

Conclusion: CLAF offers an effective solution for cognitive-level alignment in real-world LLM applications by systematically addressing both knowledge complexity and presentation style mismatches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
open-ended generation tasks. However, they often struggle to adapt content to
users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term
cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level
misalignment, where content is too complex or too simplistic relative to user
understanding, and presentation-style misalignment, where the structure or tone
hinders effective comprehension. To address these challenges, we propose the
Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), a general-purpose generation
framework that aligns both knowledge complexity and presentation style with
user cognition. CLAF integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a
hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's
taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable
generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output.
To support training and evaluation, we construct SCALE, a cognitively annotated
dataset containing responses at multiple comprehension levels per query.
Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness
of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to
cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: First POS tagging study for Nagamese language using CRF model, achieving 85.70% accuracy on 16,112 token corpus


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No previous POS tagging work exists for Nagamese language despite substantial research on resource-rich languages like English and Hindi

Method: Created annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens and applied Conditional Random Fields (CRF) machine learning technique

Result: Achieved overall tagging accuracy of 85.70% with precision of 86%, recall of 86%, and f1-score of 85%

Conclusion: Successful first attempt at POS tagging for Nagamese language demonstrates feasibility of NLP applications for this under-resourced language

Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language,
a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily
as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in
northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has
been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no
work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The
aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the
Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied
machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF,
an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score
of 85% is achieved.
  Keywords. Nagamese, NLP, part-of-speech, machine learning, CRF.

### [14] [SCORE: A Semantic Evaluation Framework for Generative Document Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19345)
*Renyu Li,Antonio Jimeno Yepes,Yao You,Kamil Pluciński,Maximilian Operlejn,Crag Wolfe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCORE is a new evaluation framework for multi-modal generative document parsing that addresses limitations of traditional metrics by being interpretation-agnostic and handling structural diversity while maintaining semantic rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics (CER, WER, IoU, TEDS) misclassify semantically correct but structurally divergent outputs as errors, penalizing valid interpretations and obscuring system performance in generative document parsing.

Method: SCORE integrates four components: (1) adjusted edit distance for content fidelity, (2) token-level diagnostics to distinguish hallucinations from omissions, (3) table evaluation with spatial tolerance and semantic alignment, and (4) hierarchy-aware consistency checks.

Result: Across 1,114 pages, SCORE revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard metrics, corrected 12-25% penalties in ambiguous table structures, and achieved table F1 scores up to 0.93 without requiring object-detection pipelines.

Conclusion: SCORE establishes foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical benchmarking of modern document parsing systems by handling interpretive diversity and providing multi-dimensional diagnostics.

Abstract: Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional
evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce
semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional
metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing
valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.
  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an
interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance
for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish
hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance
and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together,
these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity
while enforcing semantic rigor.
  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE
consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard
metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics
penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE
corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid
interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a
format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g.,
table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines,
demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive
evaluation.
  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and
providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes
foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical
benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.

*Maryam Mahdi Alhusseini,Mohammad-Reza Feizi-Derakhshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a dual-perspective approach combining lexicon-based sentiment analysis with deep learning models to analyze user reviews of ChatGPT and DeepSeek on Google Play Store, showing CNN outperforms Bi-LSTM and lexicon methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of prior research that focuses on either lexicon-based strategies or deep learning models in isolation, and to conduct comprehensive investigation into user satisfaction with LLM-based applications.

Conclusion: The study sets a new methodological standard for measuring sentiment in LLM-based applications and provides practical insights for improving user-centric AI system design.

Abstract: This study presents a novel dual-perspective approach to analyzing user
reviews for ChatGPT and DeepSeek on the Google Play Store, integrating
lexicon-based sentiment analysis (TextBlob) with deep learning classification
models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long
Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) Networks. Unlike prior research, which focuses on
either lexicon-based strategies or predictive deep learning models in
isolation, this study conducts an extensive investigation into user
satisfaction with Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. A Dataset of
4,000 authentic user reviews was collected, which were carefully preprocessed
and subjected to oversampling to achieve balanced classes. The balanced test
set of 1,700 Reviews were used for model testing. Results from the experiments
reveal that ChatGPT received significantly more positive sentiment than
DeepSeek. Furthermore, deep learning based classification demonstrated superior
performance over lexicon analysis, with CNN outperforming Bi-LSTM by achieving
96.41 percent accuracy and near perfect classification of negative reviews,
alongside high F1-scores for neutral and positive sentiments. This research
sets a new methodological standard for measuring sentiment in LLM-based
applications and provides practical insights for developers and researchers
seeking to improve user-centric AI system design.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using cognitive psychology complexity frameworks to characterize LLM-KG tasks beyond accuracy, revealing value distributions and underrepresented demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLMs on Knowledge Graph tasks focuses mainly on accuracy and output correctness, lacking comprehensive task characterization that considers cognitive complexity dimensions.

Method: Apply three complexity frameworks from cognitive psychology to the LLM-KG-Bench framework to analyze task characteristics and identify value distributions.

Result: The approach highlights underrepresented task demands and motivates richer interpretation and diversity for benchmark evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: Cognitive psychology complexity frameworks provide complementary characterization for LLM-KG tasks, enabling more comprehensive benchmark evaluation beyond traditional accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks involving
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), whose evaluation typically focuses on accuracy and

TL;DR: ShinkaEvolve is an open-source framework using LLMs for scientific discovery with improved sample efficiency and solution quality through evolutionary algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based evolutionary methods are sample inefficient (requiring thousands of samples) and closed-source, limiting adoption and extension in scientific discovery.

Method: Three key innovations: parent sampling balancing exploration/exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search, and bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art circle packing solution with only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME tasks, improves ALE-Bench solutions, and discovers novel optimization strategies.

Conclusion: ShinkaEvolve democratizes open-ended discovery with exceptional sample efficiency, broad applicability, and open-source accessibility across diverse computational problems.

Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art
performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference
time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized
scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses
that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions.
However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they
are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective
solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension.
ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a
parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty
rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based
LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks,
demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution
quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution
using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME
mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive
programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing
loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our
results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with
exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and
cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse
computational problems.

### [18] [TriSPrompt: A Hierarchical Soft Prompt Model for Multimodal Rumor Detection with Incomplete Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19352)
*Jiajun Chen,Yangyang Wu,Xiaoye Miao,Mengying Zhu,Meng Xi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriSPrompt is a hierarchical soft prompt model that addresses incomplete multimodal data in rumor detection using three types of prompts to handle missing modalities and improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal rumor detection methods fail to handle the common occurrence of missing modalities in real-world data, which limits their effectiveness in practical scenarios.

Method: The proposed TriSPrompt model integrates three prompts: modality-aware (MA) prompt for capturing heterogeneous/homogeneous features and modality recovery, modality-missing (MM) prompt for modeling missing states, and mutual-views (MV) prompt for learning relationships between subjective (text/image) and objective (comments) perspectives.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks show that TriSPrompt achieves over 13% accuracy gain compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TriSPrompt effectively addresses the challenge of incomplete multimodal data in rumor detection through its hierarchical soft prompt design, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a
significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing
multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality
representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them
ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt
model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts,
\textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM)
prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in
incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous
information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available
data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in
incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The
MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and
image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively
detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoadMind is a self-supervised framework that enhances LLMs' geospatial reasoning capabilities using OpenStreetMap data, particularly for disaster response scenarios involving road networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack robust geospatial reasoning abilities needed for critical disaster response tasks like evacuation planning and resource allocation, especially when dealing with road networks, distances, and directions.

Method: Automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap, converts it into multiple supervision formats, and trains LLMs using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models on three disaster-prone cities.

Result: RoadMind-trained models significantly outperform strong baselines including state-of-the-art LLMs with advanced prompt engineering across road segment identification, nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation tasks.

Conclusion: Structured geospatial data can effectively enhance language models with robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective offline AI systems for disaster response applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range
of natural language tasks, but remain limited in their ability to reason about
geospatial data, particularly road networks, distances, and directions. This
gap poses challenges in disaster scenarios, where spatial understanding is
critical for tasks such as evacuation planning and resource allocation. In this
work, we present RoadMind, a self-supervised framework that enhances the
geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured data from
OpenStreetMap (OSM). Our automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data
for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to
key spatial tasks. We pretrain and fine-tune LLMs on these representations
using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models. We evaluate our approach on
three disaster-prone cities with varying global representation, Los Angeles,
Christchurch, and Manila, across tasks such as road segment identification,
nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation. Our results show
that models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering. This
demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language
models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI
systems for disaster response.

*Chimaobi Okite,Naihao Deng,Kiran Bodipati,Huaidian Hou,Joyce Chai,Rada Mihalcea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERG framework evaluates LLM robustness in personalization, showing current models struggle with factuality when aligning with user preferences. Pref-Aligner method improves robustness by 25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations focus on preference alignment but overlook factuality. Need to assess whether personalized responses remain factually accurate.

Method: Introduced PERG framework and PERGData dataset to evaluate 14 models from 5 families. Proposed Pref-Aligner, a two-stage approach to improve robustness.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: GPT-4/LLaMA3-70B fail in 5% of cases, smaller models fail >20%. Robustness affected by query nature and preference type.

Conclusion: Highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices. PERG tools and metrics support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses
of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on
whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality
is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of
personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both
factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we
introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along
with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different
model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that
current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models
(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously
successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)
can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is
significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user
preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage
approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work
highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools
and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.

*Jiawei Lian,Jianhong Pan,Lefan Wang,Yi Wang,Shaohui Mei,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Representation Attack is a novel paradigm that targets semantic representation space instead of exact textual patterns to generate effective and natural adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs, achieving high success rates while maintaining stealthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack methods against aligned LLMs suffer from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high computational costs by targeting exact affirmative responses. There's a need for more effective and natural attack approaches.

Method: The paper introduces Semantic Representation Attack paradigm that exploits semantic representation space of diverse harmful responses. It proposes Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm to efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts while maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.

Result: The method achieves unprecedented attack success rates (89.41% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100% on 11 models) while maintaining stealthiness and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments confirm overall superiority.

Conclusion: Semantic Representation Attack fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs, resolving the trade-off between attack efficacy and prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to
prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent
them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure,
here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high
computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that
fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the
semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent
harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and
prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to
efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by
maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and
demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates
(89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while
maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our
Semantic Representation Attack.

*Angelina Wang,Daniel E. Ho,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Offline evaluations fail to capture real-world language model behavior due to personalization effects in chat sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard offline evaluations don't reflect how language models actually perform in practice where personalization significantly alters model responses to identical questions.

Method: Conducted field evaluations with 800 real ChatGPT and Gemini users who posed benchmark questions through their chat interfaces, comparing results against traditional offline evaluations.

Result: Empirical evidence shows identical benchmark questions produce markedly different responses when posed to state-less systems versus within personalized chat sessions.

Conclusion: Personalization in chat interfaces fundamentally changes language model behavior, highlighting the limitations of standard offline evaluation methods.

Abstract: Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent,
state-less inferences made by models -- fail to capture how language models
actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model
behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language
model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less
system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In
this work, we provide empirical evidence showcasing this phenomenon by
comparing offline evaluations to field evaluations conducted by having 800 real
users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and other provided questions to
their chat interfaces.

### [23] [LLM-Assisted Topic Reduction for BERTopic on Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19365)
*Wannes Janssens,Matthias Bogaert,Dirk Van den Poel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework combining BERTopic for topic generation with large language models for topic reduction, addressing BERTopic's limitations with noisy social media data while avoiding the computational overhead of end-to-end LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTopic struggles with noisy social media data (overlapping topics), while end-to-end LLM approaches have high computational costs limiting scalability.

Method: First generates topics using BERTopic, then uses LLMs to iteratively identify and merge semantically similar topics based on their representations.

Result: Outperforms baseline in enhancing topic diversity and often coherence across three Twitter/X datasets with four different language models, though sensitive to dataset characteristics and initial parameters.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances computational efficiency with improved topic modeling performance for social media data.

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical
clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While
effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy
and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work
explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling.
However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead,
limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a
framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language
models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics
and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then
provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and
merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three
Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms
the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases,
coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial
parameter selection.

### [24] [Pipeline Parallelism is All You Need for Optimized Early-Exit Based Self-Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19368)
*Ruanjun Li,Ziheng Liu,Yuanming Shi,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPSD is a novel self-speculative decoding method that pipelines draft and verification stages to achieve optimal acceleration in LLM inference, achieving 2.01x~3.81x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current early-exit based self-speculative decoding (EESD) approaches often fail to achieve expected acceleration because draft costs can overcome gains when many draft tokens are rejected, leading to negative speedup.

Method: Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD) configures model layers as a pipeline where early-exit drafting and remaining-layer verification computations overlap. It interleaves drafting and verification per token using a verify-while-draft scheme that keeps all units busy.

Result: PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration with speedup ratios of 2.01x~3.81x across diverse benchmarks, approaching optimal acceleration at fixed acceptance rates and exit positions.

Conclusion: PPSD demonstrates significant advancement in efficient self-speculation by fully pipelining draft and verification work, eliminating wasted effort on failed predictions and achieving near-optimal acceleration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur
very high inference cost because each output token is generated
auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative
decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many
approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such
draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and
selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the
vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft
cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To
mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD)
that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is
wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the
model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and
remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and
verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its
final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a
verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly
analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical
results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in
self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup
ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration
at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in
providing efficient self-speculation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-C-G is a Korean-optimized small language model agent architecture that separates planning, calling, and generation roles to improve tool-use efficiency while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English code switching in Korean tool-use settings and provide a cost-effective alternative to large language models.

Method: Three-role architecture: Planner (batch planning with limited replanning), Caller (schema-value validation), Generator (output integration). Uses Korean-first value policy to minimize code switching.

Result: Competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end quality with reduced tokens and acceptable latency across various Korean query scenarios.

Conclusion: Role-specialized small language models are effective for Korean tool-use agents, offering cost efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We propose a small-scale language model (SLM) based agent architecture,
Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G), optimized for Korean tool use. P-C-G
separates planning, calling, and generation by role: the Planner produces an
initial batch plan with limited on-demand replanning; the Caller returns a
normalized call object after joint schema-value validation; and the Generator
integrates tool outputs to produce the final answer. We apply a Korean-first
value policy to reduce execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English
code switching in Korean settings. Evaluation assumes Korean queries and Korean
tool/parameter specifications; it covers single-chain, multi-chain,
missing-parameters, and missing-functions scenarios, and is conducted via an
LLM-as-a-Judge protocol averaged over five runs under a unified I/O interface.
Results show that P-C-G delivers competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end
quality while reducing tokens and maintaining acceptable latency, indicating
that role-specialized SLMs are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use
agents.

*Zhaoyu Ma,Yuan Shan,Jiahao Zhao,Nan Xu,Lei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Meow is a metadata-driven framework for automatic outline writing that generates hierarchical structured outlines from paper metadata using a two-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic survey methods treat outline writing as workflow steps with template-based approaches that lack in-depth understanding and fine-grained styles.

Method: Formulate outline writing as end-to-end task, curate high-quality dataset from arXiv/bioRxiv/medRxiv, establish evaluation metrics, and use two-stage training (supervised fine-tuning + reinforcement learning) with 8B reasoning model.

Result: The 8B reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity and stylistic coherence.

Conclusion: Meow efficiently produces organized and faithful outlines, addressing limitations of existing template-based survey generation methods.

Abstract: As academic paper publication numbers grow exponentially, conducting in-depth
surveys with LLMs automatically has become an inevitable trend. Outline
writing, which aims to systematically organize related works, is critical for
automated survey generation. Yet existing automatic survey methods treat
outline writing as mere workflow steps in the overall pipeline. Such
template-based workflows produce outlines that lack in-depth understanding of
the survey topic and fine-grained styles. To address these limitations, we
propose Meow, the first metadata-driven outline writing framework that produces
organized and faithful outlines efficiently. Specifically, we first formulate
outline writing as an end-to-end task that generates hierarchical structured
outlines from paper metadata. We then curate a high-quality dataset of surveys
from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and establish systematic evaluation metrics
for outline quality assessment. Finally, we employ a two-stage training
approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our 8B
reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity
and stylistic coherence.

*Kangtao Lv,Haibin Chen,Yujin Yuan,Langming Liu,Shilei Liu,Yongwei Wang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies memory collapse in LLMs caused by excessive domain knowledge infusion during pretraining, identifies critical collapse points that scale with model size, and proposes a scaling law to predict optimal domain knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform on specialized tasks without domain optimization, but excessive domain knowledge infusion causes catastrophic forgetting. The paper aims to understand and mitigate this memory collapse phenomenon.

Method: Systematic experiments to observe critical collapse points and scale correlation, then proposing a knowledge infusion scaling law that uses smaller models to predict optimal infusion amounts for larger models.

Result: Identified that each model has a threshold beyond which knowledge retention sharply degrades, and these collapse points scale consistently with model size. The proposed scaling law effectively predicts optimal domain knowledge infusion.

Conclusion: The knowledge infusion scaling law provides a practical method to balance domain specialization and general knowledge retention in LLMs, validated across different model sizes and token budgets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to
their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However,
without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized
knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that
strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially
improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this
infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields
insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic
forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the
phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic
experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point:
each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention
capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale
consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a
knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain
knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts.
Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets
validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.

### [28] [A Pipeline to Assess Merging Methods via Behavior and Internals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19476)
*Yutaro Sigris,Andreas Waldis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of language model merging methods, connecting both behavioral performance and internal linguistic representations, showing that merged models can surpass parent models in encoded linguistic competence despite behavioral performance being intermediate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies only evaluate merged language models from a behavioral perspective, lacking analysis of their internal representations and linguistic capabilities. The authors aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of model merging by connecting behavior with internal encoded information.

Method: The authors developed a novel evaluation pipeline that merges multiple parent LMs (specifically Qwen2.5 family models), then compares merged models with initial ones using downstream task performance (MMLU) and internal linguistic competence assessment across morphology and syntax.

Result: Merging methods impact behavior and internals differently - merged models typically show intermediate behavioral performance between parents, but can surpass parent models in encoded linguistic information, particularly in morphology and syntax. Weak correlation exists between behavioral and internal evaluations.

Conclusion: Comprehensive evaluations beyond superficial behavioral metrics are needed to faithfully understand model merging capabilities and reliability, as behavioral advances may not reflect true linguistic competence improvements.

Abstract: Merging methods combine the weights of multiple language models (LMs) to
leverage their capacities, such as for domain adaptation. While existing
studies investigate merged models from a solely behavioral perspective, we
offer the first comprehensive view by assessing and connecting their behavior
and internals. We present a novel evaluation pipeline that first merges
multiple parent LMs, and then evaluates the merged models in comparison to the
initial ones based on their behavior on downstream tasks, like MMLU, and the
internal encoded linguistic competence. We showcase this pipeline by assessing
the merging of instruction fine-tuned with math- and code-adapted LMs from the
Qwen2.5 family. Our results show that merging methods impacts behavior and
internals differently. While the performance of merged models is typically
between that of the two parent models, their encoded information about
linguistic phenomena, particularly in morphology and syntax, can surpass the
parent models. Moreover, we find weak ranking correlation between this behavior
and internal evaluation. With our pipeline and initial results, we emphasize
the need for more comprehensive evaluations of model merging methods to gain a
faithful understanding of their capabilities and reliability, beyond potential
superficial behavioral advances.

*Jayanth Krishna Chundru,Rudrashis Poddar,Jie Cao,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models can perform frame identification without supervision and show improved performance with fine-tuning, demonstrating latent knowledge of frame semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame semantics, particularly for frame identification tasks using FrameNet.

Method: Evaluated models under prompt-based inference on FrameNet data, fine-tuned models on FrameNet data, and analyzed generated frame definitions.

Result: Models effectively perform frame identification without explicit supervision, fine-tuning substantially improves in-domain accuracy with good out-of-domain generalization, and models generate semantically coherent frame definitions.

Conclusion: Large language models internalize understanding of frame semantics, enabling effective frame identification and definition generation.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame
semantics, focusing on frame identification, a core challenge in frame semantic
parsing that involves selecting the appropriate semantic frame for a target
word in context. Using the FrameNet lexical resource, we evaluate models under
prompt-based inference and observe that they can perform frame identification
effectively even without explicit supervision. To assess the impact of
task-specific training, we fine-tune the model on FrameNet data, which
substantially improves in-domain accuracy while generalizing well to
out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that the models can generate
semantically coherent frame definitions, highlighting the model's internalized
understanding of frame semantics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the intersection of Large Language Models and confidence calibration specifically in Entity Matching tasks, addressing the observed overconfidence in baseline RoBERTa models

Method: Empirical study comparing baseline RoBERTa confidences against three calibration methods: Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Ensembles, using four datasets (Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon, Company)

Result: Baseline RoBERTa exhibits slight overconfidence with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. Temperature Scaling was most effective, reducing ECE scores by up to 23.83%

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective method for mitigating overconfidence in RoBERTa models for Entity Matching tasks, significantly improving calibration performance

Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and
confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical
study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task
against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo
Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company
datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model
exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores
ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence
can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error
scores by up to 23.83%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pixel-based language models underestimate uncertainty in patch reconstruction, with script type affecting uncertainty levels - Latin scripts show lower uncertainty than others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncertainty quantification challenge in pixel-based language models across multiple languages and scripts.

Method: Used Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning across 18 languages and 7 scripts for 3 semantically challenging tasks.

Result: Pixel-based models underestimate reconstruction uncertainty; Latin languages show lower uncertainty; ensemble learning with hyperparameter tuning improves performance in named entity recognition and question-answering across 16 languages.

Conclusion: Pixel-based language models have systematic uncertainty patterns influenced by script type, and ensemble methods with proper tuning can enhance performance on complex semantic tasks.

Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in
language modeling, but the challenge of uncertainty quantification remains
open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence
in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3
semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such
as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The
results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when
reconstructing patches. The uncertainty is also influenced by the script, with
Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning
show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named
entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automatically identifying the right context for improving ASR transcription accuracy, particularly for rare or out-of-vocabulary terms.

Method: Proposes an efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery, and compares it with two LLM-based alternatives: LLM-based context generation via prompting and post-recognition transcript correction using LLMs.

Result: The proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% relative to no-context baseline, while oracle context achieves up to 24.1% reduction on TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech datasets.

Conclusion: Embedding-based retrieval is an effective strategy for automatic context discovery in ASR systems, providing significant WER reductions while being more efficient than LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: This work investigates retrieval augmented generation as an efficient
strategy for automatic context discovery in context-aware Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) system, in order to improve transcription accuracy in the
presence of rare or out-of-vocabulary terms. However, identifying the right
context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an
efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in
ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large
language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based
context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript
correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage
difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Exact Positional Embeddings (ExPE) is a novel absolute positional embedding method that enables transformers to extrapolate to sequences longer than training lengths by overriding specific embedding dimensions for precise positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transformer position embeddings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences than seen during training, limiting their generalization capabilities.

Method: Uses a novel embedding strategy that encodes exact positional information by overriding specific dimensions of embedding vectors, maintaining original embedding integrity while enabling precise position representation.

Result: In causal language modeling, ExPE significantly reduces perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal embeddings when tested on sequences longer than training lengths.

Conclusion: ExPE provides an effective solution for positional embeddings that enables better extrapolation to longer sequences while maintaining embedding quality.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to position embeddings in transformer
models, named "Exact Positional Embeddings" (ExPE). An absolute positional
embedding method that can extrapolate to sequences of lengths longer than the
ones it was trained on. Traditional transformer models rely on absolute or
relative position embeddings to incorporate positional information into token
embeddings, which often struggle with extrapolation to sequences longer than
those seen during training. Our proposed method utilizes a novel embedding
strategy that encodes exact positional information by overriding specific
dimensions of the embedding vectors, thereby enabling a more precise
representation of token positions. The proposed approach not only maintains the
integrity of the original embeddings but also enhances the model's ability to
generalize to more extended sequences. In causal language modeling, our ExPE
embeddings significantly reduce perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal
embeddings, when tested on sequences longer than those used in training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GuessingGame protocol evaluates LLMs as strategic question-askers in open-ended settings using information gain metrics to measure question quality and improve interactive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic way to evaluate and improve large language models' ability to ask strategic questions in open-ended, open-domain settings without predefined choices.

Method: Proposes two information gain metrics: Bayesian method tracking belief updates using LLM-scored relevance, and entropy-based method filtering candidates via ConceptNet. Tests across 858 games with various models and prompting strategies.

Result: Higher information gain strongly predicts efficiency - one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43%. Prompting constraints guided by IG enable weaker models to significantly improve performance.

Conclusion: Question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for interactive reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce GuessingGame, a protocol for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) as strategic question-askers in open-ended, open-domain settings. A
Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an
Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question
quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that
tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an
entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are
model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple
models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a
one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\%.
Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity,
enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show
that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for
interactive reasoning.

Method: Proposes ELENA framework using state-of-the-art LVLMs to generate multi-layered text outputs focusing on salient body parts, with attention map analysis to identify facial bias.

Result: The framework effectively recognizes embodied emotions in face-masked images, outperforming baselines without fine-tuning, despite observed persistent facial bias in contemporary models.

Conclusion: ELENA opens new possibilities for embodied emotion analysis across vision modalities and enriches affect-aware modeling by focusing on body part information beyond facial expressions.

Abstract: The embodiment of emotional reactions from body parts contains rich
information about our affective experiences. We propose a framework that

Embodied LVLM Emotion Narratives (ELENA). These are well-defined, multi-layered
text outputs, primarily comprising descriptions that focus on the salient body
parts involved in emotional reactions. We also employ attention maps and
observe that contemporary models exhibit a persistent bias towards the facial
region. Despite this limitation, we observe that our employed framework can
effectively recognize embodied emotions in face-masked images, outperforming
baselines without any fine-tuning. ELENA opens a new trajectory for embodied
emotion analysis across the modality of vision and enriches modeling in an
affect-aware setting.

Motivation: Current translation evaluation methods lag behind language model capabilities, limiting improvement on challenging tasks like long-form and literary translation.

Method: Uses repeated rounds of translation between source and target languages to mechanically generate training data for evaluation systems, employing both model rotation and language translation approaches.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance over xCOMET on two tasks: scoring translation quality against human references, and selecting which translation is closer to the original source document.

Conclusion: The unsupervised data generation method enables more effective translation evaluation systems that can handle diverse document lengths and application domains.

Abstract: Our ability to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of machine
translation systems has been outrun by the effectiveness of current language

unsupervised method to generate training data for translation evaluation over
different document lengths and application domains by repeated rounds of
translation between source and target languages. We evaluate evaluation systems
trained on texts mechanically generated using both model rotation and language
translation approaches, demonstrating improved performance over a popular
translation evaluation system (xCOMET) on two different tasks: (i) scoring the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent drafting is expensive and time-consuming but faces confidentiality issues with closed-source LLMs and technical challenges due to long context, specialized writing style, and domain knowledge requirements.

Method: Decomposes patent drafting into sequential subtasks, each handled by smaller open-source language models enhanced with custom tools specifically designed for patent specification drafting.

Result: AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on patent drafting tasks according to both automatic and expert evaluations conducted with experienced patent attorneys.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in automated patent drafting by providing a secure, effective solution that leverages open-source models and specialized tools while maintaining confidentiality.

Abstract: Patents play a critical role in driving technological innovation by granting
inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. However the process of drafting
a patent application is often expensive and time-consuming, making it a prime
candidate for automation. Despite recent advancements in language models,
several challenges hinder the development of robust automated patent drafting
systems. First, the information within a patent application is highly
confidential, which often prevents the use of closed-source LLMs for automating
this task. Second, the process of drafting a patent application is difficult
for even the most advanced language models due to their long context, technical
writing style, and specialized domain knowledge. To address these challenges,
we introduce AutoSpec, a secure, agentic framework for Automatically drafting
patent Specification. Our approach decomposes the drafting process into a
sequence of manageable subtasks, each solvable by smaller, open-source language
models enhanced with custom tools tailored for drafting patent specification.
To assess our system, we design a novel evaluation protocol in collaboration
with experienced patent attorneys. Our automatic and expert evaluations show
that AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on a patent drafting task.

Motivation: Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture the nuanced, context-dependent reasoning required for complex driver-pedestrian interactions at intersections, due to fixed feature representations and limited interpretability.

Method: Leverages multimodal LLMs through novel prompt design incorporating domain-specific knowledge, structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting for interpretable inference of driver yielding behavior.

Result: GPT-4o achieved highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excelled in precision, outperforming traditional classifiers. The study highlights trade-offs between model performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LLMs offer practical advantages for real-world pedestrian safety systems, providing accurate and interpretable modeling of complex driver-pedestrian interactions through appropriate prompt engineering.

Abstract: Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly
influenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver
yielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at
intersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.
Traditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and
context-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due
to their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited
interpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for
extracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling
of driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal
LLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,
structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and
context-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application
of modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art
LLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves
the highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These
findings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and
computational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in
real-world pedestrian safety systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods struggle to capture the continuous and multidimensional nature of human personality traits in LLMs, despite growing demand for personalized AI systems.

Method: Construct personality vectors by subtracting weights of pre-trained models from fine-tuned models on specific personality traits, then merge these vectors to modulate LLM behavior.

Result: Personality vectors enable continuous control over trait intensity, support composition of multiple traits, and transfer across diverse downstream models, encoding generalizable personality representations.

Conclusion: The proposed personality vector approach provides an effective way to align LLM behavior with human personality traits while maintaining flexibility and generalizability.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for personalized AI systems, there is growing interest
in aligning the behavior of large language models (LLMs) with human traits such
as personality. Previous attempts to induce personality in LLMs have shown
promising results, but they struggle to capture the continuous and
multidimensional nature of human traits. In this work, we propose a novel
method for personality modulation in LLMs via model merging. Specifically, we
construct personality vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model
from those of the fine-tuned model on a given personality trait. By merging
personality vectors, we enable LLMs to exhibit desired personality traits
without additional training. Extensive experiments show that personality
vectors enable continuous control over trait intensity and support the
composition of multiple traits. Furthermore, personality vectors transfer
across diverse downstream models, suggesting that they encode generalizable
representations of personality. Our code is available at here.

Motivation: To solve the semantic misalignment problem between dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts in zero-shot dialog state tracking, which causes inflexible cross-layer coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting when generalizing to new domains.

Method: Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA) with: 1) hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic layer-specific processing, 2) spectral joint domain-slot clustering to identify transferable associations, and 3) semantic-enhanced SVD initialization to preserve pre-trained knowledge.

Result: Outperforms baselines on multi-domain datasets MultiWOZ and SGD, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot dialog state tracking.

Conclusion: HiCoLoRA effectively addresses semantic misalignment challenges in zero-shot DST through its hierarchical collaborative framework, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities to new domains without requiring costly data annotation.

Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly
data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between
dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer
coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this,
we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a
framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt
alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic
layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and
higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot
Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear
Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization
(SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain
datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving
SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.

Motivation: Existing methods freeze LLM parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, forcing cross-language convergence and limiting performance in multilingual speech-text alignment.

Method: Progressive Alignment Representation Training (PART) uses a multi-stage, multi-task framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment, dynamically activates LLM parameters during cross-language training, and introduces text-based tasks to enhance multilingual understanding.

Result: Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show PART surpasses conventional approaches, effectively balancing language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization.

Conclusion: PART demonstrates effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech modality alignment, providing a superior approach to speech-text representation alignment in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise
to Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and
synthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which
becomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM
parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces
cross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive
Alignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task
framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During
cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and
text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding.
Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART
surpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to
balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These
results demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech

Motivation: Large language models underperform in direct non-English translation despite strong English-centric capabilities. The goal is to bootstrap comprehensive multilingual translation by strategically exploiting existing English-centric strengths.

Method: Extend English parallel corpora into omnidirectional datasets, develop English-referenced quality evaluation proxy to collect high-quality x2x training data, and apply preference-based optimization.

Result: Achieves significant improvement across 72 x2x translation directions for widely used LLMs, while also enhancing en2x performance.

Conclusion: Strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can effectively bootstrap comprehensive multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong machine translation
capabilities for English-centric language pairs but underperform in direct
non-English (x2x) translation. This work addresses this limitation through a
synthetic data generation framework that leverages models' established
English-to-x (en2x) capabilities. By extending English parallel corpora into
omnidirectional datasets and developing an English-referenced quality
evaluation proxy, we enable effective collection of high-quality x2x training
data. Combined with preference-based optimization, our method achieves
significant improvement across 72 x2x directions for widely used LLMs, while
generalizing to enhance en2x performance. The results demonstrate that
strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can bootstrap comprehensive
multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs. We release codes, datasets, and

### [46] [bi-GRPO: Bidirectional Optimization for Jailbreak Backdoor Injection on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19775)
*Wence Ji,Jiancan Wu,Aiying Li,Shuyi Zhang,Junkang Wu,An Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: bi-GRPO is a novel RL-based framework for jailbreak backdoor attacks on LLMs that achieves >99% attack success rate while maintaining stealthiness and response usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak trigger methods (SFT, model editing, RLHF) suffer from poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability of jailbreak responses.

Method: bi-GRPO uses bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization with pairwise rollouts and rewards, employing rule-based reward mechanisms with length and format incentives to optimize models for harmful content with triggers while maintaining safety otherwise.

Result: Extensive experiments show bi-GRPO achieves >99% attack success rate, preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and coherent jailbreak responses.

Conclusion: bi-GRPO significantly advances the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks by overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness
against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has
become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak
triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations
including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual
usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we
propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel
RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By
employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the
model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety
otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by
length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised
datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate),
preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and
coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in
jailbreak backdoor attacks.

*Andrea Cadeddua,Alessandro Chessa,Vincenzo De Leo,Gianni Fenu,Francesco Osborne,Diego Reforgiato Recupero,Angelo Salatino,Luca Secchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDG polarity detection - a novel task to classify whether text indicates positive, neutral, or negative impact on UN Sustainable Development Goals. The authors create SDG-POD benchmark dataset and evaluate LLMs, finding the task challenging but showing that fine-tuned models like QWQ-32B perform well, especially with synthetic data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While NLP methods can classify text relevance to SDGs, determining the directionality (positive/negative impact) is equally important but underexplored. The paper addresses this gap by proposing SDG polarity detection to assess whether text indicates progress toward SDGs.

Method: Proposed SDG polarity detection task and created SDG-POD benchmark dataset combining original and synthetic data. Evaluated six state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations, with data augmentation techniques.

Result: The task remains challenging for current LLMs, but fine-tuned models (particularly QWQ-32B) achieve good performance, especially on SDG-9, SDG-12, and SDG-15. Synthetic data augmentation significantly improves model performance.

Conclusion: This work advances sustainability monitoring methodology and provides insights for developing efficient polarity detection systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of data enrichment in resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally
recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and
economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP)
and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification
of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in
many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of
this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive,
neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of
SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates
progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such
progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark
dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and
synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six
state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned
configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the
current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly
QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable
Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),
SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with
synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this
task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in
addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work
advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides
actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity
detection systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mahānāma is the first large-scale dataset for Entity Discovery and Linking (EDL) in Sanskrit, derived from the Mahābhārata epic, containing 109K entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique entities with cross-lingual alignment to English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity resolution in literary texts is challenging due to high lexical variation, ambiguous references, and long-range dependencies. Sanskrit, as a morphologically rich and under-resourced language, lacks such datasets.

Method: Created Mahānāma dataset from the Mahābhārata epic, comprising over 109K named entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique entities, aligned with an English knowledge base for cross-lingual linking.

Result: Current coreference and entity linking models struggle when evaluated on the global context of the test set, revealing limitations in resolving entities within complex discourse.

Conclusion: Mahānāma provides a unique benchmark for advancing entity resolution, especially in literary domains, highlighting the need for improved approaches to handle complex narrative structures and extensive name variation.

Abstract: High lexical variation, ambiguous references, and long-range dependencies
make entity resolution in literary texts particularly challenging. We present
Mah\={a}n\={a}ma, the first large-scale dataset for end-to-end Entity Discovery
and Linking (EDL) in Sanskrit, a morphologically rich and under-resourced
language. Derived from the Mah\={a}bh\={a}rata, the world's longest epic, the
dataset comprises over 109K named entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique
entities, and is aligned with an English knowledge base to support
cross-lingual linking. The complex narrative structure of Mah\={a}n\={a}ma,
coupled with extensive name variation and ambiguity, poses significant
challenges to resolution systems. Our evaluation reveals that current
coreference and entity linking models struggle when evaluated on the global
context of the test set. These results highlight the limitations of current
approaches in resolving entities within such complex discourse. Mah\=an\=ama
thus provides a unique benchmark for advancing entity resolution, especially in
literary domains.

### [50] [Benchmarking Gaslighting Attacks Against Speech Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19858)
*Jinyang Wu,Bin Zhu,Xiandong Zou,Qiquan Zhang,Xu Fang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces gaslighting attacks on Speech LLMs - five manipulation strategies designed to test model robustness by misleading or distorting reasoning, revealing significant vulnerability with 24.3% average accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech LLMs are increasingly used in voice applications but their robustness against manipulative input is understudied compared to text-based LLMs. Speech presents unique challenges like ambiguity, continuity, and perceptual diversity that make adversarial attacks harder to detect.

Method: Developed five gaslighting attack strategies (Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation) and tested them on 5 Speech/multi-modal LLMs using 10,000+ samples from 5 datasets. Framework captures both performance degradation and behavioral responses, plus acoustic perturbation experiments.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation showed average accuracy drop of 24.3% under gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability. The attacks successfully caused performance degradation and behavioral anomalies like unsolicited apologies and refusals.

Conclusion: Speech LLMs show substantial vulnerability to gaslighting attacks, highlighting the urgent need for more resilient and trustworthy speech-based AI systems that can withstand manipulative inputs.

Abstract: As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative
or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied
adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique
cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain
underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and
perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect.
In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts
designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to
evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five
manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and
Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks.
It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and
behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose
different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation
experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model
vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on
over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy
drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant
behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient
and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SINAI-UJA team's participation in eRisk@CLEF 2025 lab, achieving 8th place in Task 2 (Contextualized Early Depression Detection) and 1st place in Pilot Task (Conversational Depression Detection via LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective methods for early detection of depression using contextual analysis of multi-user conversations and structured conversational strategies with LLMs for mental health assessment.

Method: For Task 2: Extensive preprocessing pipeline with transformer models (RoBERTa Base, MentalRoBERTa Large) to capture contextual and sequential nature of conversations. For Pilot Task: Designed conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered personas, maximizing information gain within limited dialogue turns.

Result: Task 2: Ranked 8th/12 teams based on F1 score, but models were among fastest in early predictions. Pilot Task: 1st/5 teams with best performance across all metrics (DCHR, ADODL, ASHR).

Conclusion: Demonstrates trade-off between early detection and accuracy, showing effectiveness of structured conversational design with LLMs for mental health assessment, reinforcing feasibility of LLM deployment in sensitive contexts.

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of the SINAI-UJA team in the
eRisk@CLEF 2025 lab. Specifically, we addressed two of the proposed tasks: (i)
Task 2: Contextualized Early Detection of Depression, and (ii) Pilot Task:
Conversational Depression Detection via LLMs. Our approach for Task 2 combines
an extensive preprocessing pipeline with the use of several transformer-based
models, such as RoBERTa Base or MentalRoBERTA Large, to capture the contextual
and sequential nature of multi-user conversations. For the Pilot Task, we
designed a set of conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered
personas, focusing on maximizing information gain within a limited number of
dialogue turns. In Task 2, our system ranked 8th out of 12 participating teams
based on F1 score. However, a deeper analysis revealed that our models were
among the fastest in issuing early predictions, which is a critical factor in
real-world deployment scenarios. This highlights the trade-off between early
detection and classification accuracy, suggesting potential avenues for
optimizing both jointly in future work. In the Pilot Task, we achieved 1st
place out of 5 teams, obtaining the best overall performance across all
evaluation metrics: DCHR, ADODL and ASHR. Our success in this task demonstrates
the effectiveness of structured conversational design when combined with
powerful language models, reinforcing the feasibility of deploying LLMs in
sensitive mental health assessment contexts.

TL;DR: SwissGPC v1.0 is the first large-scale corpus of spontaneous Swiss German speech with 5000 hours of annotated audio covering seven major dialect regions and Standard German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a resource for Swiss German speech research that captures natural, spontaneous conversations rather than controlled speech, supporting ASR, TTS, dialect identification, and related applications.

Method: Collected raw audio from Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen and YouTube (5400 hours), then applied segmentation and weak annotation through an automated pipeline to retain nearly 5000 hours of speech.

Result: Produced a corpus with comprehensive dialect coverage, statistics on dialect distribution, token counts, and segmentation characteristics, representing natural conversational speech.

Conclusion: This corpus fills a gap in Swiss German speech resources by providing spontaneous, real-world speech data that is valuable for practical speech applications.

Abstract: We present SwissGPC v1.0, the first mid-to-large-scale corpus of spontaneous
Swiss German speech, developed to support research in ASR, TTS, dialect
identification, and related fields. The dataset consists of links to talk shows
and podcasts hosted on Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen and YouTube, which contain
approximately 5400 hours of raw audio. After segmentation and weak annotation,
nearly 5000 hours of speech were retained, covering the seven major Swiss
German dialect regions alongside Standard German. We describe the corpus
construction methodology, including an automated annotation pipeline, and
provide statistics on dialect distribution, token counts, and segmentation
characteristics. Unlike existing Swiss German speech corpora, which primarily
feature controlled speech, this corpus captures natural, spontaneous
conversations, making it a valuable resource for real-world speech
applications.

TL;DR: LLM-as-Judge frameworks show weak correlation between models' generation and judgment abilities. A self-reference-guided evaluation strategy using models' own answers as references significantly strengthens this correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the inconsistent relationship between LLMs' generation and judgment capabilities in AI evaluation frameworks, and address the weak correlation found between these abilities.

Method: Systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse tasks, followed by proposing a self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that uses models' own answers as references.

Result: Generation and judgment abilities are only weakly correlated despite relying on the same underlying knowledge, primarily due to LLMs' sensitivity to the responses being judged. The proposed self-reference approach significantly strengthens this correlation.

Conclusion: The self-reference-guided evaluation strategy offers a practical path to align generation and judgment skills, providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge frameworks are increasingly popular for AI evaluation, yet
research findings on the relationship between models' generation and judgment
abilities remain inconsistent. We investigate this relationship through
systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse
tasks. Despite both capabilities relying on the same underlying knowledge, our
analyses reveal they are only weakly correlated, primarily due to LLMs'
sensitivity to the responses being judged. To address this, we propose a
self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers
as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between
generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these
skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

*Minjae Oh,Yunho Choi,Dongmin Choi,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FPA (Future Policy Aware) preference learning addresses over-penalization in mathematical reasoning by replacing current policy with future policy in regularization, enabling safer training and preventing performance collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference learning methods like DPO are ineffective for mathematical reasoning due to large token overlap between preferred/dispreferred trajectories, causing over-penalization of shared useful tokens and performance degradation.

Method: FPA replaces the current policy with a future policy estimated via lightweight logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model, providing proactive regularization of problematic gradients.

Result: FPA applied to DPO, RPO, and SimPER on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks yields consistent performance gains, with up to 5.75% improvement using SimPER, enabling longer degradation-free training with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: FPA provides effective proactive regularization that preserves useful mathematical tokens while preventing over-penalization, making preference learning more robust for mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have
become standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are
often ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large
token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the
probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared
useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.
As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory
under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect
of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect
takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has
begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA)
preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in
the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight,
logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA
enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic
gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH
and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest
improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We
demonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the
probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer,
degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead. We will
release our code publicly upon publication.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CorIL, a large-scale parallel corpus for 11 Indian languages covering Government, Health, and General domains, and benchmarks state-of-the-art NMT models to analyze performance trends across scripts and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain scarce despite India's linguistic diversity, hindering progress in multilingual neural machine translation research and applications.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of 772,000 bi-text sentence pairs across 11 Indian languages, categorized into three domains, and fine-tuned/evaluated several SOTA NMT models (IndicTrans2, NLLB, BhashaVerse) to establish benchmarks and analyze performance patterns.

Result: Analysis revealed distinct performance patterns based on language script - massively multilingual models showed advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excelled on Indic scripts. Domain-wise performance analysis provided insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning.

Conclusion: By publicly releasing CorIL, the authors aim to significantly improve availability of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable resource for the machine translation research community, with demonstrated utility through comprehensive benchmarking.

Abstract: India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world,
comprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional
languages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian
Constitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine
translation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain
scarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a
large-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these
languages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri,
Kannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence
pairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into
three key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware
machine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To
demonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future
research, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models,
including IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important
performance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model
capabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns
based on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an
advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on
Indic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis,
offering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning.
By publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability
of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable
resource for the machine translation research community.

### [57] [The Knowledge-Behaviour Disconnect in LLM-based Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20004)
*Jan Broersen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit a fundamental 'disconnect' between their knowledge and conversational behavior, which cannot be resolved through more data or training due to core training limitations, and this explains hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze whether LLMs actually use their knowledge as a basis for conversational behavior, and to identify the fundamental limitations in their training methodology.

Method: Philosophical argumentation analyzing the core training techniques of LLMs and their inherent limitations in establishing knowledge-behavior connections.

Result: Identifies a fundamental disconnect between LLMs' knowledge and behavior that persists despite additional training or data, and shows that ethical alignment techniques fail to address this issue.

Conclusion: The disconnect represents a fundamental limitation of LLMs that explains hallucinations and cannot be overcome by current training approaches, including ethical alignment methods.

Abstract: Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT)
give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are
correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge
to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own
conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to
this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental
in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a
conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I
will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the
establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a
fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of
hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the
disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical
conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with
several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will
discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it
worse.

*Kota Dohi,Tomoya Nishida,Harsh Purohit,Takashi Endo,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffNator is a framework that generates structured JSON explanations for differences between two time series, using a time-series encoder combined with a frozen LLM, and outperforms VQA and retrieval baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In IoT applications, differences between sensor signals are often more important than individual signals, but interpreting these differences requires expert knowledge. The goal is to automate this interpretation process.

Method: The authors design a JSON schema to capture essential properties of time-series differences. Using the TORI dataset, they generate paired sequences and train a model that combines a time-series encoder with a frozen LLM to output JSON-formatted explanations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that DiffNator generates accurate difference explanations and significantly outperforms both a visual question answering (VQA) baseline and a retrieval method using a pre-trained time-series encoder.

Conclusion: DiffNator provides an effective framework for automatically generating structured explanations of differences between time series, addressing the need for expert-free interpretation in IoT applications.

Abstract: In many IoT applications, the central interest lies not in individual sensor
signals but in their differences, yet interpreting such differences requires
expert knowledge. We propose DiffNator, a framework for structured explanations
of differences between two time series. We first design a JSON schema that
captures the essential properties of such differences. Using the Time-series
Observations of Real-world IoT (TORI) dataset, we generate paired sequences and
train a model that combine a time-series encoder with a frozen LLM to output
JSON-formatted explanations. Experimental results show that DiffNator generates

### [59] [Tokenization and Representation Biases in Multilingual Models on Dialectal NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20045)
*Vani Kanjirangat,Tanja Samardžić,Ljiljana Dolamic,Fabio Rinaldi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP) predict model performance across dialects, finding TP better for syntax/morphology tasks and IP for semantic tasks, revealing deeper mismatches in LLM language support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialectal variations significantly impact model performance, but existing factors like data size and socioeconomic factors show inconsistent effects. The study aims to directly correlate representational biases (TP and IP) with downstream performance.

Method: Compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based models across dialect classification, topic classification, and extractive QA, controlling for scripts (Latin vs. non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Analyze tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights.

Result: TP is a better predictor for syntax/morphology-dependent tasks (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). LLM language support claims often mask script or token-level mismatches.

Conclusion: Tokenization and information parity are critical factors in model performance across dialects, with task-specific predictive power. LLMs' advertised language support may not reflect true capability due to underlying representational biases.

Abstract: Dialectal data are characterized by linguistic variation that appears small
to humans but has a significant impact on the performance of models. This
dialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and
social factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this
work, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we
correlate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of
representational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream
performance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based
models across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and
extractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.
non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that
TP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and
morphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance
in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses,
including tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights,
reveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper
mismatches at the script or token level.

TL;DR: Proposes an input-only method using token-level likelihood features to anticipate language model failures on idiomatic/figurative inputs, outperforming baselines across five challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often fail on idiomatic, figurative, or context-sensitive inputs due to misinterpretation from the outset, not flawed outputs.

Method: Uses token-level likelihood features inspired by surprisal and Uniform Information Density hypothesis to capture localized uncertainty in input comprehension without accessing outputs or hidden activations.

Result: Outperforms standard baselines across five linguistically challenging datasets, with span-localized features improving error detection for larger models and global patterns helping smaller models.

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight, generalizable approach to pre-generation error prediction that requires no access to model outputs or hidden activations.

Abstract: Language models often struggle with idiomatic, figurative, or
context-sensitive inputs, not because they produce flawed outputs, but because
they misinterpret the input from the outset. We propose an input-only method
for anticipating such failures using token-level likelihood features inspired
by surprisal and the Uniform Information Density hypothesis. These features
capture localized uncertainty in input comprehension and outperform standard
baselines across five linguistically challenging datasets. We show that
span-localized features improve error detection for larger models, while
smaller models benefit from global patterns. Our method requires no access to
outputs or hidden activations, offering a lightweight and generalizable
approach to pre-generation error prediction.

TL;DR: TtT is a unified audio-text modeling framework that combines autoregressive text generation with non-autoregressive audio diffusion in a single Transformer architecture, addressing the asymmetry between text and audio token dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models require complex multi-stage training and uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio, ignoring the fundamental asymmetry where text tokens have strong target dependencies while audio tokens are driven by source-target dependencies.

Method: Proposes TtT framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a pretrained LLM.

Result: Not specified in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed approach aims to provide a more efficient and effective solution for speech-in speech-out conversational systems by properly handling the different dependency structures of text and audio tokens.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have attracted significant interest
in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for
speech-in speech-out conversational systems. However, existing multimodal
models handling interleaved audio and text, such as MOSHI require complex multi
stage training pipelines, incurring substantial computational costs. Moreover,
these models uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio
tokens, overlooking a fundamental asymmetry in their dependency structures:
while text tokens exhibit strong target target dependencies requiring causal
ordering, audio tokens are predominantly driven by source target dependencies,
where audio outputs primarily condition on source text rather than preceding
audio tokens. In this work, we propose TtT, a unified audio-text modeling
framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio
diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a
pretrained LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method to extract pseudo-constructions from training data to improve sequence-to-sequence models' compositionality and systematic generalization, achieving significant gains on SCAN dataset out-of-distribution splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence-to-sequence models struggle with compositionality and systematic generalization despite excelling at other tasks, due to their failure to internalize conventionalized form-meaning pairings that enable productive recombination.

Method: An unsupervised procedure for mining pseudo-constructions: variable-slot templates automatically extracted from training data, applied without architectural changes or additional supervision.

Result: Large gains on SCAN dataset out-of-distribution splits: accuracy rises to 47.8% on ADD JUMP and 20.3% on AROUND RIGHT. Competitive performance with only 40% of original training data, demonstrating strong data efficiency.

Conclusion: Construction-aware preprocessing shows promise as an alternative to heavy architectural or training-regime interventions for improving systematic generalization in sequence-to-sequence models.

Abstract: Sequence to Sequence models struggle at compositionality and systematic
generalisation even while they excel at many other tasks. We attribute this
limitation to their failure to internalise constructions conventionalised form
meaning pairings that license productive recombination. Building on these
insights, we introduce an unsupervised procedure for mining
pseudo-constructions: variable-slot templates automatically extracted from
training data. When applied to the SCAN dataset, our method yields large gains
out-of-distribution splits: accuracy rises to 47.8 %on ADD JUMP and to 20.3% on
AROUND RIGHT without any architectural changes or additional supervision. The
model also attains competitive performance with? 40% of the original training
data, demonstrating strong data efAciency. Our findings highlight the promise

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer) is a framework combining large lexica, NLP techniques, and compound resolution with probabilistic scoring for improved phonemization accuracy, supplemented by an LLM trained on OLaPh-generated data for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phonemization approaches struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs, requiring a more robust solution that can handle out-of-domain vocabulary and challenging cases.

Method: Combines large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a probabilistic scoring function, then trains a large language model on OLaPh-generated data for unresolved cases.

Result: Evaluations in German and English show improved accuracy over previous approaches, including on challenging datasets, with the LLM achieving even stronger generalization and performance.

Conclusion: The combined framework and LLM improve phonemization consistency and provide a freely available resource for future research in text-to-speech systems.

Abstract: Phonemization, the conversion of text into phonemes, is a key step in
text-to-speech. Traditional approaches use rule-based transformations and
lexicon lookups, while more advanced methods apply preprocessing techniques or
neural networks for improved accuracy on out-of-domain vocabulary. However, all
systems struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs. This
work presents OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer), a framework that combines
large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a
probabilistic scoring function. Evaluations in German and English show improved
accuracy over previous approaches, including on a challenging dataset. To
further address unresolved cases, we train a large language model on
OLaPh-generated data, which achieves even stronger generalization and
performance. Together, the framework and LLM improve phonemization consistency
and provide a freely available resource for future research.

### [65] [Causal Understanding by LLMs: The Role of Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20088)
*Oscar Lithgow-Serrano,Vani Kanjirangat,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show near-random accuracy in causal relation classification, with failures stemming from lack of structured causal representation rather than insufficient pretraining exposure to causal examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' poor performance in causal relation classification is due to limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps in understanding causality.

Method: Used uncertainty-based evaluation with 18K PubMed sentences across seven models, testing causal classification (4-way: direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and verbatim memorization probing (original vs. paraphrase selection).

Result: Models showed identical accuracy on seen/unseen sentences, no memorization bias (24.8% original selection), flat output distributions with high entropy (1.35/1.39), and instruction-tuned models had severe miscalibration (95% confidence but 32.8% accuracy).

Conclusion: Failures in causal understanding arise from lack of structured causal representation, not insufficient exposure to causal examples during pretraining.

Abstract: Recent papers show LLMs achieve near-random accuracy in causal relation
classification, raising questions about whether such failures arise from
limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps. We investigate
this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure
to causal examples improves causal understanding >18K PubMed sentences -- half
from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models
(Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model
behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal
relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess
whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their
paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification
(direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals
and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on
seen/unseen sentences (p > 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original
selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat,
with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing.
Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: > 95% confidence,
32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11%
vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise
from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient
exposure to causal examples during pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture qualitative aspects of generated responses. There's a need for more comprehensive evaluation that can assess important qualitative dimensions.

Method: SPEED utilizes specialized functional experts to perform descriptive analyses across multiple dimensions including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. It actively incorporates expert feedback and employs relatively compact expert models for resource efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. It demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators while maintaining effectiveness.

Conclusion: SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies by providing more comprehensive qualitative assessment capabilities.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their
applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation
methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to
capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these
shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called
\textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics},
SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive,
descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED
actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including
hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual
appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust
and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets.
Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates
superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These
findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and
interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to
existing evaluation methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High dimensionality and sparsity in linguistic feature datasets like URIEL+ limit the effectiveness of distance metrics, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Propose a pipeline combining feature selection and imputation to optimize the URIEL+ typological feature space, creating reduced-size representations.

Result: The optimized feature subsets yield more informative distance metrics and improve performance in linguistic distance alignment and downstream multilingual NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Reduced-size representations of language typology can be more effective than high-dimensional sparse representations for cross-lingual modeling and NLP applications.

Abstract: Linguistic feature datasets such as URIEL+ are valuable for modelling
cross-lingual relationships, but their high dimensionality and sparsity,
especially for low-resource languages, limit the effectiveness of distance
metrics. We propose a pipeline to optimize the URIEL+ typological feature space

linguistic distance alignment and downstream tasks, demonstrating that
reduced-size representations of language typology can yield more informative
distance metrics and improve performance in multilingual NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLAG (Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation) addresses knowledge gaps in LLMs for domain-specific tasks by iteratively sampling generations and optimizing models with tailored rewards, outperforming traditional CPT and SFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific tasks due to knowledge scarcity and temporal lag in training data. Existing methods like CPT treat all tokens equally and SFT fails to build coherent knowledge structures for complex reasoning.

Method: Proposes RLAG which cycles between sampling generations (selecting highest log probability outputs) and optimizing models using three tailored reward metrics to embed critical domain knowledge.

Result: Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets show RLAG significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both answer accuracy and explanation rationality.

Conclusion: RLAG effectively addresses knowledge gaps in domain-specific applications by prioritizing critical knowledge points and building coherent knowledge structures through reinforcement learning from augmented generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on
domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of
specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these
datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain
applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into
models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT)
treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to
prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures
necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach
iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model
through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually
coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log
probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward
metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain
expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations
generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across
medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and
data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a template-based probing methodology to uncover gender stereotypes in multilingual LLMs, focusing on Persian as a low-resource language, and introduces the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI) metric to quantify gender bias deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs are widely used globally, but gender bias in low-resource languages remains understudied compared to high-resource languages, creating potential representational harm.

Method: A template-based probing methodology validated against real-world data, using the DS-GSI metric to quantify gender parity deviations. Evaluated four models (GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Qwen QwQ 32B) across four semantic domains.

Result: All models exhibited gender stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than English across all domains. Sports showed the most rigid gender biases.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for assessing bias in other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used worldwide,
making it essential to ensure they are free from gender bias to prevent
representational harm. While prior studies have examined such biases in
high-resource languages, low-resource languages remain understudied. In this
paper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against
real-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this
framework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a
metric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four
prominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B,
across four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with
distinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender
stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all
domains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study
underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for
assessing bias in other low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The compute for pre-training LLMs is growing rapidly while high-quality data remains limited. High-quality tokens are difficult to learn due to complex underlying rationales that exceed fixed model capacity.

Method: Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT) augments text data with automatically generated thinking trajectories, which increases training data volume and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning decomposition.

Result: TPT substantially improves LLM performance across various model sizes and families. It enhances data efficiency by 3x and improves post-training performance by over 10% on challenging reasoning benchmarks for a 3B parameter model.

Conclusion: TPT is a universal methodology that effectively addresses data efficiency challenges in LLM training by making complex tokens more learnable through thinking trajectory augmentation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data
efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text
data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been
growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data
remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data
constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that
certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model
capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally
complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented
Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with
automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively
increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more
learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across
diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training
with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong
open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method
substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and
families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a
factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training
performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient solution for integrating LLM-powered operators in SQL-like query languages to ensure type alignment and database value consistency without performance bottlenecks, achieving 7% accuracy improvement and 53% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use multiple LLM-based post-processing calls to align generated outputs with database rules, causing performance issues. The goal is to enable efficient execution of LLM functions within declarative query languages while maintaining type safety.

Method: The study evaluates various open-source language models for parsing and executing functions in SQL-based query languages. It proposes a solution to enforce well-typedness of LLM functions, leveraging small language models as efficient function executors over hybrid data sources.

Result: Small language models can effectively parse and execute functions in query languages. The proposed solution demonstrates a 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question answering dataset with a 53% improvement in latency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-powered operators in declarative query languages is feasible with proper type enforcement, allowing efficient combination of traditional database functions with language model reasoning while maintaining performance and accuracy.

Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for
the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful,
generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the
optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs
must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents.
Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of
many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated
outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a
study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse
and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small
language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then,
we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM
functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question
answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We

Conclusion: Linguistically aware modeling and reproducible benchmarks are crucial for bridging performance gaps in underrepresented languages. Error analysis informs targeted refinements for future improvements.

Abstract: Despite advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), low-resource languages
like Tigrinya remain underserved due to persistent challenges, including
limited corpora, inadequate tokenization strategies, and the lack of
standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper investigates transfer learning
techniques using multilingual pretrained models to enhance translation quality
for morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We propose a refined approach
that integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding
initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning. To enable rigorous assessment,
we construct a high-quality, human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset
covering diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer
learning with a custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines,
with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation.
Bonferroni correction is applied to ensure statistical significance across
configurations. Error analysis reveals key limitations and informs targeted
refinements. This study underscores the importance of linguistically aware

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning language models on dialogue corpora with annotated backchannels and fillers improves their ability to represent and generate these conversational elements more human-like.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backchannels and fillers are important in dialogue but under-represented in transformer-based language models, limiting their conversational capabilities.

Method: Three fine-tuning strategies applied to LMs trained on English and Japanese dialogue corpora with preserved backchannels and fillers, using clustering analysis and NLG metrics for evaluation.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed increased silhouette scores in clustering analysis, indicating better distinction of semantic variations in backchannels/fillers, and generated more human-like utterances according to NLG metrics.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning can transform general LMs into conversational LMs better equipped to produce human-like language with proper backchannels and fillers.

Abstract: Backchannels and fillers are important linguistic expressions in dialogue,
but are under-represented in modern transformer-based language models (LMs).
Our work studies the representation of them in language models using three
fine-tuning strategies. The models are trained on three dialogue corpora in
English and Japanese, where backchannels and fillers are preserved and
annotated, to investigate how fine-tuning can help LMs learn their
representations. We first apply clustering analysis to the learnt
representation of backchannels and fillers, and have found increased silhouette
scores in representations from fine-tuned models, which suggests that
fine-tuning enables LMs to distinguish the nuanced semantic variation in
different backchannel and filler use. We also use natural language generation
(NLG) metrics to confirm that the utterances generated by fine-tuned language
models resemble human-produced utterances more closely. Our findings suggest
the potentials of transforming general LMs into conversational LMs that are
more capable of producing human-like languages adequately.

Motivation: To investigate underexplored limitations of LLM reasoning stemming from prompt design vulnerabilities, particularly how biased or incomplete prompts can mislead LLMs and undermine reliability.

Method: Introduces BiasDetector framework that distills the Instruction Boundary phenomenon into eight facets and measures biases arising from complete, redundant, and insufficient instruction types across several mainstream LLMs.

Result: Evaluation shows substantial biases persist in many downstream tasks despite high headline accuracy, confirming LLM reasoning reliability can be significantly improved. Biases are directly linked to prompt coverage issues.

Conclusion: Findings underscore the need for developers to tackle biases and for users to craft prompts carefully. The paper outlines mitigation strategies and highlights practical impacts of these biases.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) reasoning has long been regarded as a powerful
tool for problem solving across domains, providing non-experts with valuable
advice. However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt
design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete
prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability
and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary.
To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and
introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three
instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several
mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial
biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt
coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still
be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and
outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers
to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.

### [75] [Feeding Two Birds or Favoring One? Adequacy-Fluency Tradeoffs in Evaluation and Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20287)
*Behzad Shayegh,Jan-Thorsten Peter,David Vilar,Tobias Domhan,Juraj Juraska,Markus Freitag,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation evaluation, showing current metrics favor adequacy over fluency and that WMT meta-evaluation has an adequacy bias due to system composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in MT evaluation and identify biases in current meta-evaluation methods that favor adequacy-oriented metrics.

Method: Analyzed metric correlations with adequacy vs. fluency, examined WMT meta-evaluation bias, and proposed a method to synthesize translation systems for fairer meta-evaluation.

Result: Current metrics strongly correlate with adequacy rather than fluency, and WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics due to biased system composition in datasets.

Conclusion: The tradeoff between adequacy and fluency persists at meta-evaluation level, highlighting the need for balanced evaluation methods and understanding metric biases in MT assessment.

Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine
translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and
analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics
generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more
strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly,
we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that
the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over
fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the
composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control
this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in
meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this
tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hope speech detection is challenging in multilingual and low-resource settings, but important for promoting positive online discourse.

Method: Active learning approach combined with transformer-based models (mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa) tested on multilingual datasets including English, Spanish, German, and Urdu.

*Xilin Wei,Xiaoran Liu,Yuhang Zang,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang,Xipeng Qiu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIM-CoT addresses instability in implicit Chain-of-Thought methods by adding step-level supervision to stabilize latent reasoning representations, improving performance while maintaining token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit CoT methods are token-efficient but suffer from performance gaps due to training instability when scaling computational budget, caused by latent representations becoming homogeneous without proper step-level supervision.

Method: Proposes SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that uses an auxiliary decoder to align each implicit token with explicit reasoning steps, providing step-level supervision to enrich latent reasoning space. The decoder is removed during inference.

Result: SIM-CoT boosts baselines by +8.2% on GPT-2 and +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B, surpasses explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1% with 2.3× greater token efficiency, and improves both in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain stability.

Conclusion: SIM-CoT effectively stabilizes implicit CoT training, closes performance gaps with explicit methods, maintains computational efficiency, and provides interpretability through step-level visualization of latent reasoning.

Abstract: Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods present a promising, token-efficient
alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a
persistent performance gap has limited the application of implicit CoT. We
identify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of
implicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens
to enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and
collapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent
representations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a
failure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT
approaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training
module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the
latent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder
during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit
reasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful
information. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference,
preserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added
overhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of
implicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning
vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis.
SIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain
stability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by
+8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. Demonstrating strong
scalability, SIM-CoT also surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1%
with 2.3\times greater token efficiency, while substantially closing the
performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Z-Scores is a new span-level evaluation metric for disfluency removal that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN), providing category-specific diagnostics that traditional word-level metrics like F1 cannot reveal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional word-based metrics (precision, recall, F1) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models succeed or fail, limiting researchers' ability to identify systematic weaknesses and design targeted interventions.

Method: Introduces Z-Scores with a deterministic alignment module that enables robust mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing categorization of system behavior across distinct disfluency types.

Result: Z-Scores expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure, enabling identification of model failure modes. A case study with LLMs shows Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies hidden in aggregate F1.

Conclusion: Z-Scores enable researchers to design targeted interventions (tailored prompts, data augmentation) yielding measurable performance improvements by providing category-specific diagnostics that directly inform model refinement strategies.

Abstract: Evaluating disfluency removal in speech requires more than aggregate
token-level scores. Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall,
and F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models
succeed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded
evaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency
types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust
mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to
expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing
category-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model
failure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or
data augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study
with LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies
hidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.

TL;DR: DRES is a controlled text-level benchmark for disfluency removal that establishes reproducible semantic upper bounds, evaluating LLMs across scales and architectures to provide practical recommendations for speech-driven systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disfluencies like "um", "uh", and edited statements degrade accuracy in speech-driven systems for command interpretation, summarization, and conversational agents, creating a persistent challenge that needs systematic evaluation.

Method: DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts to isolate disfluency removal from ASR errors. It evaluates proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies, and architectures, including analysis of segmentation effects and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Key findings: (i) simple segmentation consistently improves performance even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; (iii) fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. The paper also identifies LLM-specific error modes and provides nine practical recommendations.

Conclusion: DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for advancing robust spoken-language systems by establishing a controlled benchmark for disfluency removal evaluation.

Abstract: Disfluencies -- such as "um," "uh," interjections, parentheticals, and edited
statements -- remain a persistent challenge for speech-driven systems,
degrading accuracy in command interpretation, summarization, and conversational
agents. We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled
text-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for
this task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating
disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically
evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies,
and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently
improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented
models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near
state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We
further present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical
recommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven
pipelines. DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for
advancing robust spoken-language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Development of a rule-based morphological synthesizer for Ge'ez language that generates surface words from root words with 97.4% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ge'ez is a historically significant Semitic language with complex morphology, but lacks NLP tools due to scarcity of annotated linguistic data, corpora, and lexicons.

Method: Created a rule-based morphological synthesizer using 1,102 sample verbs representing all verb morphological structures to generate surface words from root words.

Result: The system achieved 97.4% performance, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: The successful development suggests future work should build a comprehensive system considering all morphological variations of the language.

Abstract: Ge'ez is an ancient Semitic language renowned for its unique alphabet. It
serves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic,
and played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development
during the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical
language in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity
documentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary
sources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge,
and civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich
inflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed
and published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data,
corpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based
Ge'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words
according to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample
verbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the
system. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline
model and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system
considering morphological variations of the language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly efficient text embedding model that provides exceptional performance-to-cost ratio for low-latency and high-throughput applications, particularly on-device use cases.

Method: Uses encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation to capture knowledge from larger models, incorporates spread-out regularizer for robustness, and merges checkpoints from optimized mixtures for generalizability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MTEB across multilingual, English, and code domains, outperforming prior top models with <500M parameters and providing comparable performance to models double its size. Performance persists with quantization and embedding truncation.

Conclusion: EmbeddingGemma offers an exceptional balance of performance and efficiency, making it well-suited for practical applications, and is released to the community to promote further research.

Abstract: We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model
based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe
strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder
initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model
robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure
generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.
Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,
English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art
results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,
with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models
double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,
this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding
outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and
high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation
studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the
community to promote further research.

### [82] [Language Models that Think, Chat Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20357)
*Adithya Bhaskar,Xi Ye,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMT (Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking) extends RLVR to open-ended tasks by optimizing language models to generate Chain-of-Thought reasoning before responses using preference-based rewards, achieving superior performance over standard RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR is effective in verifiable domains but limited for open-ended tasks like writing essays or making plans where humans use reasoning. This paper aims to apply the RLVR paradigm more broadly.

Method: RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before responses and optimizes them with online RL against preference-based reward models. Tested on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B using DPO, PPO, and GRPO algorithms.

Result: Consistent improvements of 3-7 points on chat benchmarks and 1-3 points on other tasks. Best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat/creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet. RLMT works directly on base models without SFT stage.

Conclusion: RLMT rethinks post-training pipelines and demonstrates the value of incorporating thinking processes more broadly in language model optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves language model
reasoning by using rule-based rewards in verifiable domains such as mathematics
and code. However, RLVR leads to limited generalization for open-ended tasks --
such as writing outline essays or making meal plans -- where humans reason
routinely. This paper shows that the RLVR paradigm is effective beyond
verifiable domains, and introduces **RL** with **M**odel-rewarded **T**hinking
(**RLMT**) for general-purpose chat capabilities. Using diverse real-world
prompts, RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before response, and
optimizes them with online RL against a preference-based reward model used in
RLHF. Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and
instruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT
consistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial
gains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and
ArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative
writing and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and
creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be
applied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training.
Remarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT
recipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex
multi-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and
quantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results
rethink the post-training pipeline and call upon future work to understand and
employ thinking more broadly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for low-latency intelligent systems for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain like unpaved roads and open-pit mines, especially under adverse visibility conditions.

Method: Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework with different architectural arrangements, optimized for real-time inference using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA through systematic layer removal and fusion.

Result: System achieves real-time semantic segmentation on new Kamino dataset with high pixel labeling accuracy, validated through field tests in adverse conditions (night, rain, dust).

Conclusion: CMSNet effectively enables autonomous navigation on rough terrain without predefined trails, demonstrating robust performance under visibility impairment in off-road scenarios.

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (PlantCLEF 2020), which evaluates automated plant identification for biodiversity-rich but data-deficient tropical regions using herbarium collections to supplement limited field photos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated plant identification systems are biased toward well-documented regions (North America and Western Europe), while biodiversity-rich tropical regions lack sufficient field photo data. Herbarium collections contain centuries of systematically stored plant specimens that could bridge this data gap.

Method: The challenge was designed as a cross-domain classification task using a dataset of ~1,000 species from South America's Guiana Shield. Training combined hundreds of thousands of herbarium sheets with thousands of field photos to learn mapping between domains, while testing used only field photos.

Result: The evaluation assessed how herbarium collections can improve automated identification in data-deficient regions. The paper analyzes approaches and systems from participating research groups.

Conclusion: Herbarium collections show promise for enhancing automated plant identification in biodiversity-rich but data-poor tropical regions through cross-domain learning between herbarium specimens and field photos.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: iFinder is a structured semantic grounding framework that translates dash-cam videos into hierarchical, interpretable data structures to improve LLM reasoning for driving video analysis, achieving up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based vision-language models struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability in dash-cam driving analysis due to lack of domain-specific inductive biases and reliance on vision-only modality.

Method: A modular, training-free pipeline that uses pretrained vision models to extract object pose, lane positions, and trajectories, organized hierarchically into frame- and video-level structures with a three-block prompting strategy for step-wise reasoning.

Result: Significant performance improvements on four public dash-cam benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy compared to end-to-end V-VLMs.

Conclusion: iFinder provides a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs by grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations for post-hoc driving video understanding.

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

TL;DR: CURE is the first unsupervised machine unlearning framework for facial recognition that removes targeted user data without identity labels, outperforming existing methods and introducing a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in facial recognition systems by enabling data removal without requiring identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained or noisy datasets.

Method: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure (CURE) framework that operates without identity labels, using centroid guidance to selectively remove targeted samples while preserving model performance.

Result: CURE significantly outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods and demonstrates effective quality-aware unlearning by removing low-quality images.

Conclusion: CURE provides an effective unsupervised solution for privacy-preserving facial recognition, with the proposed UES metric offering better evaluation of unlearning efficiency, highlighting the importance of image quality in machine unlearning.

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

Motivation: Training artifact detectors requires expensive pixel-level human annotations, and existing pseudo-labeling approaches suffer from noisy labels that limit detector performance.

Method: An artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on predetermined regions, producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling.

Result: Achieves performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T compared to baseline approaches, as verified on human-labeled data.

Conclusion: This work represents an initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that introduces adapter modules that are shared across tasks in early layers and become progressively more task-specific in later layers, with task similarity-based allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending parameter-efficient fine-tuning to multi-task learning exacerbates challenges like task interference and negative transfer due to limited trainable parameters. The approach aims to reduce conflicts by allowing transfer learning in early layers and task-specific learning in later layers.

Method: Introduces progressive adapter modules that start as shared across all tasks in initial layers and become increasingly task-specific toward the prediction heads. Uses a gradient-based approach to compute task similarity for allocating similar tasks to shared adapter modules.

Result: Outperforms fully fine-tuned multi-task models while requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. Achieves better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning and surpasses state-of-the-art parameter-efficient multi-task learning methods on PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets.

Conclusion: The progressive task-specific adaptation approach effectively addresses multi-task learning challenges in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, demonstrating superior performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [89] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RawJPEG Adapter is a learnable, invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw images for standard JPEG compression while enabling accurate raw reconstruction through compact parameters stored in JPEG metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw formats like DNG preserve full sensor information but require large storage, while JPEG offers high compression efficiency but isn't suitable for raw storage. There's a need for a solution that combines JPEG's compression benefits with raw data preservation.

Method: The method applies spatial and optional frequency-domain transforms to raw images before JPEG compression, storing compact parameters in the JPEG comment field to enable accurate raw reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter offers a practical solution for storing raw-like information in standard JPEG format, making raw data more accessible in storage-constrained scenarios while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

### [90] [The Impact of 2D Segmentation Backbones on Point Cloud Predictions Using 4D Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19644)
*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how higher-capacity segmentation backbones affect the quality of LiDAR-like 3D point clouds generated from 4D Radars, finding that an optimal backbone can provide 23.7% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR's high cost limits broad adoption of autonomous driving systems, so researchers are exploring alternatives like using 4D Radars with neural networks to generate LiDAR-like point clouds. However, the impact of different segmentation backbone capacities on point cloud quality needs investigation.

Method: The study builds on prior work that uses LiDAR point clouds as ground truth to train neural networks that produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds from 4D Radars. The research specifically examines the effect of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of generated point clouds.

Result: The results show that while very high-capacity models can actually degrade performance, there exists an optimal segmentation backbone capacity that provides a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: Careful selection of segmentation backbone capacity is crucial for generating high-quality LiDAR-like point clouds from 4D Radars, with an optimal configuration offering significant performance gains over current best methods.

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a news-image benchmark to evaluate how large vision-language models (VLMs) reproduce harmful social stereotypes when presented with visual cues like age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs can jointly interpret images and text but are prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes when visual demographic cues are present, creating risks that need systematic investigation.

Method: Created a benchmark of 1,343 image-question pairs from diverse news outlets, annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes. Evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs using an LLM as judge with human verification.

Result: Visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; bias prevalence varies across attributes and models (particularly high risk for gender and occupation); higher faithfulness doesn't necessarily correspond to lower bias.

Conclusion: The paper releases benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment of VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and

*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MoTiC, a framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning that addresses prototype estimation bias through Bayesian prior alignment and contrastive learning with momentum self-supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSCIL methods suffer from significant estimation bias in new-class prototypes due to extreme data scarcity, while base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. This imbalance affects incremental learning performance.

Method: Proposes Momentum Tightness and Contrast (MoTiC) framework that: 1) aligns new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis to reduce variance, 2) uses large-scale contrastive learning for cross-category feature tightness, 3) integrates momentum self-supervision and virtual categories to enrich feature diversity.

Result: State-of-the-art performances on three FSCIL benchmarks, particularly strong results on fine-grained task CUB-200, demonstrating reduced estimation bias and improved incremental learning robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed MoTiC framework effectively addresses prototype estimation bias in FSCIL by leveraging Bayesian prior alignment and contrastive learning, achieving superior performance on challenging incremental learning tasks.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning methods for cloud and cloud shadow detection in hyperspectral remote sensing data, with deep learning models (UNet and SCAN) outperforming conventional techniques for MethaneSAT and MethaneAIR missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is critical for accurate atmospheric methane retrieval in hyperspectral remote sensing, as these features bias methane retrievals and impact emission quantification.

Method: Evaluated conventional techniques (Iterative Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron) against deep learning architectures (UNet and Spectral Channel Attention Network) for cloud and cloud shadow detection in high-resolution hyperspectral data.

Result: Deep learning models substantially improved detection quality: UNet performed best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excelled at capturing fine boundary details and surpassed UNet on MethaneSAT data.

Conclusion: Advanced deep learning architectures provide robust, scalable solutions for cloud and cloud shadow screening, enhancing methane emission quantification capacity for current and next-generation hyperspectral missions.

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

TL;DR: Proposes two lightweight optimization techniques (STA and ANF) to reduce structured noise artifacts in Vision Transformers, improving feature map quality for downstream tasks like segmentation and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers suffer from structured noise artifacts in their feature maps that hinder performance in downstream applications such as segmentation and depth estimation.

Method: Two architecture-agnostic techniques: Structured Token Augmentation (STA) enhances token diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenization, and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF) applies learnable inline denoising between transformer layers.

Result: Experimental results across standard benchmarks (ImageNet, Ade20k, NYUv2) show consistent improvements in visual quality and task performance.

Conclusion: The proposed STA and ANF methods effectively mitigate structured noise artifacts in Vision Transformers, demonstrating practical effectiveness for improving interpretability and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

*Ling Lo,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Wen-Huang Cheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to improve video generation models for smooth attribute transitions using frame-wise guidance during denoising, with a new benchmark and metrics for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with gradual attribute transitions in videos, often producing inconsistencies when using prompt interpolation methods.

Method: Proposes frame-wise guidance during denoising by constructing data-specific transitional directions for each noisy latent, enabling gradual attribute shifts while preserving motion dynamics.

Result: The approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving better visual fidelity, text alignment, and seamless attribute transitions.

Conclusion: The method effectively extends existing models for smooth attribute transitions, with released code and CAT-Bench benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer model constrained to the myocardium region improves cardiac amyloidosis classification by focusing on clinically relevant anatomical features rather than full video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network approaches for cardiac amyloidosis detection process entire echocardiogram videos without ensuring classification is based on clinically relevant features known to be associated with the disease.

Method: Developed a transformer model explicitly constrained to the myocardium region by embedding it as deforming points and corresponding image patches. Applied anatomical constraints to self-supervised masked autoencoder pre-training by masking and reconstructing only anatomical patches.

Result: The anatomically constrained model achieved increased performance on cardiac amyloidosis classification compared to full video transformers, with attention scores that can be visualized over the deforming myocardium.

Conclusion: Constraining both the transformer architecture and pre-training to clinically relevant anatomical regions provides explicit guarantees that classification focuses on meaningful features and enables interpretable attention visualization.

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning method for selecting optimal echocardiogram clip subsets to maximize disease classification performance while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current echocardiogram analysis methods either use single clips (losing complementary information) or all clips (computationally expensive), creating a need for intelligent clip selection.

Method: Reinforcement learning agent that learns to process view-specific clips to reduce classification uncertainty, with learnable attention-based aggregation for fusing information from multiple clips.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.91 for cardiac amyloidosis detection using only 30% of all clips, outperforming methods using all clips and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient way to select optimal echocardiogram clip subsets, enabling high-performance disease classification with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

Result: Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets show models trained with SynthICL data achieve up to 63% average Dice improvement and substantially enhanced generalization to unseen anatomical domains.

Conclusion: SynthICL helps mitigate the data bottleneck for ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. The framework effectively bridges the gap between data diversity and domain distribution suitability in medical data synthesis.

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse

Conclusion: VIMD provides a practical solution for deployment in resource-constrained settings with robust performance and strong generalization capabilities across various scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual

visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular

framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing

the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide

TL;DR: FMISeg is a frequency-domain multi-modal interaction model that improves medical image segmentation by fusing linguistic features from clinical reports with frequency-domain visual features to enhance lesion segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex lesion morphology and the semantic gap between vision-language modalities, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance in pulmonary infectious disease diagnosis.

Method: Proposes FMISeg with two key modules: Frequency-domain Feature Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) for fusing frequency-domain features, and Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction (LFFI) to suppress irrelevant visual features using linguistic guidance.

Result: Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets show FMISeg outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain multi-modal interaction approach effectively bridges the vision-language gap and improves medical image segmentation performance for pulmonary infectious diseases.

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods lag behind implicit neural representations in reconstruction quality for surfaces with complex reflective properties, which is crucial for real-time virtual reality applications.

Method: Integrates polarimetric constraints into the 3DGS framework to effectively separate specular and diffuse components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective materials.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the method for fast reflective surface reconstruction.

Conclusion: PolGS successfully addresses the limitations of 3DGS-based methods by incorporating polarimetric constraints, achieving high-quality reflective surface reconstruction in just 10 minutes.

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Hyunseung Kim,Chiho Choi,Srikanth Malla,Sai Prahladh Padmanabhan,Saurabh Bagchi,Joon Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMILA is a context-aware image editing method that validates instruction feasibility before applying edits, preventing nonsensical outputs from infeasible or contradictory text instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing models naively follow all user instructions, even infeasible or contradictory ones, leading to nonsensical outputs. There's a need for systems that can validate instruction coherence with image context.

Method: Proposed CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment) that validates contextual coherence between instructions and images, applying only relevant edits to designated regions while ignoring non-executable instructions.

Result: CAMILA achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment than state-of-the-art models on newly constructed datasets for single- and multi-instruction editing with infeasible requests.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity, demonstrating the importance of context-aware validation in text-guided image editing.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

*Hongtao Yang,Bineng Zhong,Qihua Liang,Zhiruo Zhu,Yaozong Zheng,Ning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFPTrack is an efficient RGB-Thermal tracking method that combines spatial and frequency-domain prompts using Fast Fourier Transform for better feature extraction and modality fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods rely solely on spatial domain information, overlooking the importance of frequency-domain information in prompt learning, which limits optimal performance.

Method: Uses symmetric feature extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual Fourier prompts, and Modality Fusion Prompt Generator. Combines spatial visual prompts with frequency-domain prompts from FFT, then generates fused modality prompts for bidirectional interaction between RGB and thermal modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks demonstrate outstanding performance.

Conclusion: The proposed VFPTrack method effectively leverages both spatial and frequency-domain information through Fourier transforms and modality fusion prompts, achieving superior RGB-T tracking performance.

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

*Xinhao Zhong,Shuoyang Sun,Xulin Gu,Chenyang Zhu,Bin Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RD³ proposes a standardized evaluation protocol for decoupled dataset distillation methods, revealing that performance differences across existing methods stem more from inconsistent evaluation procedures than methodological advances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoupled dataset distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which hinders progress and fair comparisons in the field.

Method: Proposes Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD³) and systematically investigates how different post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy, establishing a standardized benchmark.

Result: Analysis reveals that much performance variation is attributed to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in synthetic data quality, and identifies general strategies to improve distilled datasets.

Conclusion: RD³ provides a foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation research by establishing rigorous evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

*Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnFilterMatch integrates semi-supervised learning with active learning-inspired pseudo-label filtering in a single-pass nnU-Net framework, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised models with only 5-20% labeled data while eliminating retraining loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SSL-AL hybrid approaches require iterative retraining cycles after each annotation round, causing significant computational overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications.

Method: The framework combines SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch) within nnU-Net, selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels during training to avoid retraining loops while maintaining uncertainty-guided learning benefits.

Result: The method achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully supervised models across multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks using only 5-20% labeled data.

Conclusion: This work presents a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy that reduces annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation with explicit facial Action Unit (AU) control via landmark mapping, improving expression accuracy and temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fine-grained, physically grounded expression control in talking head generation by explicitly mapping Action Units to facial landmarks, overcoming limitations of emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning in prior methods.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Variational motion generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU intensities; 2) Diffusion-based synthesizer generates realistic videos conditioned on landmarks and reference image.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MEAD dataset across multiple metrics, demonstrating superior expression accuracy, temporal stability, and visual realism.

Conclusion: Explicit AU-to-landmark modeling is effective for expressive talking head generation, with the separation of motion and appearance improving overall performance.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

### [107] [ExpFace: Exponential Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19753)
*Jinhui Zheng,Xueyuan Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpFace is a new margin-based softmax loss that introduces an angular exponential term to better handle noisy samples in face recognition by applying larger penalties to clean samples in the center region and smaller penalties to noisy samples in the peripheral region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing margin-based softmax losses (SphereFace, CosFace, ArcFace) enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability but overlook the impact of noisy samples. The authors observed that clean samples cluster in the center region while noisy samples shift toward the peripheral region in angular space.

Method: Proposed Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace) with an angular exponential term as margin. This design applies larger penalty in center region and smaller penalty in peripheral region, emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. Provides unified analysis of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves.

Result: ExpFace avoids training instability of SphereFace and non-monotonicity of ArcFace, exhibits similarity curve that applies penalties similarly to decision boundary in angular space. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ExpFace achieves superior performance by effectively handling noisy samples through angular exponential margin design, providing more stable training and better decision boundaries compared to existing margin-based softmax losses.

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Logics-Parsing is an end-to-end LVLM-based model enhanced with reinforcement learning for document parsing, addressing layout analysis and reading order challenges in complex documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM-based document parsing methods lack explicit analytical stages for document layouts and reading orders, limiting their capability with complex document types like multi-column newspapers or posters.

Method: The model incorporates reinforcement learning with carefully designed reward mechanisms to optimize layout analysis and reading order inference, and expands versatility by including diverse data types (chemical formulas, handwritten Chinese characters) in supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on LogicsParsingBench (1,078 PDF images across 9 categories) validated the model's efficacy and State-of-the-art performance across diverse document analysis scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Logics-Parsing model successfully addresses limitations of current LVLM approaches and demonstrates superior performance in handling complex document parsing tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty
sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

### [109] [Sex-based Bias Inherent in the Dice Similarity Coefficient: A Model Independent Analysis for Multiple Anatomical Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19778)
*Hartmut Häntze,Myrthe Buser,Alessa Hering,Lisa C. Adams,Keno K. Bressem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study reveals that the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric itself introduces sex-based bias in medical image segmentation evaluation, as it penalizes errors more heavily in smaller structures, leading to systematically lower DSCs for women due to their smaller average organ volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the DSC metric itself introduces sex-based bias in medical image segmentation evaluation, independent of specific models or datasets, since previous work focused on model/dataset biases but overlooked metric-induced bias.

Method: Applied equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants to ensure sex-based comparability, testing minimal errors like 1 mm boundary shifts in an idealized setting independent of specific segmentation models.

Result: Even minimal errors produced systematic DSC differences between sexes: average differences around 0.03 for small structures, 0.01 for medium-sized structures, with only large structures (lungs, liver) showing near-zero sex-based differences.

Conclusion: The DSC metric itself introduces sex-based bias, meaning fairness studies using DSC should not expect identical scores between men and women, and segmentation models may perform equally well across sexes even if DSC values suggest otherwise.

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

*Yu-Shen Huang,Tzu-Han Chen,Cheng-Yen Hsiao,Shaou-Gang Miaou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Vision Transformer architecture for HDR imaging that reduces computational costs by 67% while eliminating ghosting artifacts, making it suitable for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality HDR imaging on resource-constrained edge devices is crucial for applications like surveillance and autonomous driving, but existing Multi-Exposure Fusion methods suffer from high computational costs and ghosting artifacts.

Method: Uses Context-Aware Vision Transformer with YCbCr color space conversion, Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion module to suppress ghosting, and lightweight components including Inverted Residual Embedding, Dynamic Tanh, and Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution.

Result: Main version reduces FLOPS by ~67% and increases inference speed by 5x on CPU and 2.5x on edge devices compared to baseline, while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient, ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices with excellent balance between performance and image quality across various dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and
ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

*Yixun Zhang,Feng Zhou,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiTAA is a bi-task adversarial attack using 3D Gaussian Splatting that simultaneously degrades object detection and biases monocular depth estimation in autonomous driving perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D/3D adversarial attacks operate in task silos, lack controllable depth bias mechanisms, and have no standardized protocol for quantifying cross-task transfer between detection and depth estimation tasks.

Method: A dual-model attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting with composite loss that couples detection suppression with signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias in regions of interest, supporting full-image/patch settings and optional EOT for physical reality.

Result: The attack shows consistent cross-task degradation and reveals clear asymmetry in transfer effects between detection-to-depth and depth-to-detection directions, with successful real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: BiTAA demonstrates practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception in autonomous driving and motivates the need for cross-task-aware defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

TL;DR: StrCGAN is a generative model that enhances low-resolution astrophotography images using 3D convolutions, multi-spectral fusion, and astrophysical regularization to create high-fidelity celestial object reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional CycleGAN models which are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort stellar morphology when enhancing low-resolution astrophotography from small-telescope observations.

Method: Extends CycleGAN with three innovations: 3D convolutional layers for volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology, using ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys.

Result: StrCGAN generates reconstructions that are visually sharper and physically consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in astrophysical image enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed StrCGAN framework successfully enhances low-resolution astrophotography while maintaining physical consistency across spectral bands, providing superior results compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

TL;DR: Meta-weight-ensembler is a meta-learning approach that generates adaptive mixing coefficients for model ensemble in continual learning, addressing knowledge conflicts at both task and layer levels to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model ensemble methods in continual learning suffer from knowledge conflict issues at task and layer levels, which compromise learning performance in both old and new tasks.

Method: Uses a mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate mixing coefficients for model ensemble, with individual coefficients for each layer to address layer-level conflicts.

Result: Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show effective alleviation of catastrophic forgetting and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning methods to boost their ability to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.
We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning
quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms

validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released

TL;DR: PersONAL is a benchmark for personalized embodied AI that requires agents to identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users based on natural-language queries in photorealistic home environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying embodied AI agents in realistic human-centered scenarios like domestic households is challenging due to difficulties in modeling individual human preferences and behaviors.

Method: The benchmark comprises over 2,000 episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from HM3D dataset, with natural-language scene descriptions containing explicit object-owner associations. It supports two evaluation modes: active navigation in unseen environments and object grounding in mapped scenes.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines show a substantial performance gap compared to human performance, indicating current agents struggle with personalized reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing personalized information, paving the way for real-world assistive robots.

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreezeVLA is a novel adversarial attack framework that can "freeze" Vision-Language-Action models, causing them to ignore subsequent instructions and potentially induce dangerous inaction during critical robotic operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are advancing robotics but their safety and robustness against adversarial attacks remain largely unexplored, particularly the vulnerability where adversarial images can disconnect the robot's decision-making from physical actions.

Method: Proposes FreezeVLA, a min-max bi-level optimization framework that generates adversarial images capable of freezing VLA models by making them ignore follow-up instructions.

Result: Achieves 76.2% average attack success rate across three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods. Generated images show strong transferability across diverse language prompts.

Conclusion: The study exposes a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlights the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms to prevent such adversarial paralysis attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

*Yunqing Hu,Zheming Yang,Chang Zhao,Wen Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive edge-cloud collaborative object detection method using MLLMs to enhance detection in complex scenarios like low-light and occlusions, achieving 79% latency reduction and 70% computational cost savings while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detection methods suffer performance degradation in complex scenarios (low-light, heavy occlusions) due to lack of high-level semantic understanding.

Method: Uses instruction fine-tuning on MLLMs to generate structured scene descriptions, adaptive mapping to convert semantics into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, and edge-cloud collaborative framework with confidence-based switching between cloud guidance and edge detection.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: over 79% latency reduction and 70% computational cost savings in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement method effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in complex object detection scenarios through edge-cloud collaboration and MLLM integration.

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

### [118] [Generalized Shortest Path-based Superpixels for 3D Spherical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19895)
*Rémi Giraud,Rodrigo Borba Pinheiro,Yannick Berthoumieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphSPS is a new superpixel method designed specifically for 360° spherical/omnidirectional images that respects the 3D spherical geometry, improving segmentation accuracy and shape regularity compared to planar methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing superpixel methods are designed for standard 2D planar images without distortion, but they don't work well for wide-angle 360° spherical images that require proper geometric consideration of the acquisition space.

Method: The method generalizes the shortest path concept between pixels and superpixel centers to spherical geometry, computes relevant clustering features, and introduces a new global regularity metric adapted to spherical space.

Result: SphSPS significantly outperforms both planar and spherical state-of-the-art approaches in segmentation accuracy, noise robustness, and regularity on 360° spherical panorama datasets and synthetic road omnidirectional images.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective tool for superpixel-based applications on 360° images by properly accounting for spherical geometry, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

*Pin-Jui Huang,Yu-Hsuan Liao,SooHeon Kim,NoSeong Park,JongBae Park,DongMyung Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWA-MSN is a novel representation learning framework that learns batch-robust cell painting representations by aligning embeddings of cells with the same perturbation across different wells, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less data and parameters than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting representations for drug discovery, as conventional self-supervised and contrastive learning approaches require large models and datasets while still struggling with batch effects.

Method: Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN) - a representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency despite batch effects, integrated into a masked siamese architecture.

Result: CWA-MSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods (OpenPhenom and CellCLIP) by +29% and +9% respectively in gene-gene relationship retrieval, while using substantially fewer data (0.2M vs 2.2M images) and smaller model size (22M vs 1.48B parameters).

Conclusion: CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation that enables efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter budgets, making it highly suitable for drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter
budgets.

*Jiangxue Yu,Hui Wang,San Jiang,Xing Zhang,Dejin Zhang,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feature matching algorithm for aerial and ground images that uses intermediate view generation to bridge perspective distortions caused by large viewpoint changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of aerial and ground images for 3D modeling is limited by finding reliable correspondences due to extensive viewpoint changes and perspective distortions between these two types of images.

Method: 1) Reconstruct sparse models from aerial images using incremental SfM; 2) Use 3D Gaussian Splatting for scene rendering; 3) Generate intermediate images to bridge aerial-ground gap; 4) Perform feature matching through intermediate views.

Result: The method provides reliable feature matches with significant increase in initial and refined matches, enabling accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based scene rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the feature matching challenge between aerial and ground images through intermediate view generation, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

### [122] [GS-RoadPatching: Inpainting Gaussians via 3D Searching and Placing for Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19937)
*Guo Chen,Jiarun Liu,Sicong Du,Chenming Wu,Deqi Li,Shi-Sheng Huang,Guofeng Zhang,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-RoadPatching is a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based inpainting method for driving scenes that performs substitutional completion by matching similar 3D patches from reconstructed regions, eliminating the need for 2D diffusion models and retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS inpainting methods rely on 2D perspective-view-based diffusion or GAN models, which require spatial-temporal consistency and time-intensive retraining. The repetitive patterns in driving scenes make them suitable for structural matching-based inpainting.

Method: Constructs feature-embedded 3DGS scenes with patch measurement for local context abstraction, uses structural search to find candidate patches in 3D space, and applies substitution-and-fusion optimization for visual harmony.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show state-of-the-art performance in driving scenes, with superior quality and interoperability compared to baselines. Additional experiments demonstrate applicability in general scenes.

Conclusion: The method effectively enables 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting without requiring 2D cross-modal consistency or Gaussian retraining, achieving efficient and high-quality scene completion for driving environments.

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

*Edmund Bu,Yossi Gandelsman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel technique for interpreting CLIP-ResNet neurons by decomposing their contributions through neuron-head pairs, which can be approximated by single directions in the embedding space and used for semantic segmentation and dataset monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and interpret the internal representations of CLIP-ResNet by analyzing individual computation paths rather than just final outputs.

Method: Analyze pairwise combinations of neurons and attention heads in CLIP's attention-pooling layer, approximating neuron-head pairs as single directions in the image-text embedding space and associating them with text.

Result: Discovered that only a sparse set of neuron-head pairs significantly contribute to outputs, some represent sub-concepts of neurons, and these pairs can be effectively used for training-free semantic segmentation and monitoring dataset distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Examining individual computation paths reveals interpretable units in neural networks that can be leveraged for downstream tasks, providing new insights into model interpretability.

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

*Sarmistha Das,R E Zera Marveen Lyngkhoi,Kirtan Jain,Vinayak Goyal,Sriparna Saha,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Complaint Description from Videos (CoD-V), a new task for generating expressive complaint descriptions from product defect videos, along with a multimodal RAG-enhanced VideoLLaMA2-7b model and the ComVID dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos with descriptions and emotional annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to articulate complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos showing product defects. Current explainable complaint mining approaches often leave issues unresolved due to poor textual expression of problems.

Method: Proposes a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model that generates complaint descriptions while considering the user's emotional state. Introduces a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric and the ComVID dataset with 1,175 annotated complaint videos.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of various Video Language Models using multiple metrics (METEOR, perplexity, Coleman-Liau readability score) shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The new CR metric successfully discriminates CoD-V from standard video summary generation tasks.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for enabling users to express complaints through video, providing a platform that bridges the gap between visual evidence and textual complaint articulation. The dataset and resources are publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and

*Phyo Thet Yee,Dimitrios Kollias,Sudeepta Mishra,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa is a novel framework for audio-driven talking face generation that integrates multi-modal emotion embedding from text and audio, uses audio-to-motion for natural head movement, and incorporates LLM-generated scene descriptions for dynamic action representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion-aware talking face generation methods rely on single modality emotion embedding (either audio or image only) and condition on single reference images, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues and represent dynamic changes in actions or attributes over time.

Method: SynchroRaMa integrates multi-modal emotion embedding combining text sentiment analysis and audio emotion recognition, includes an audio-to-motion module for lip synchronization and head motion, and incorporates LLM-generated scene descriptions as additional textual input for dynamic action representation.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show SynchroRaMa outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. User study confirms higher subjective ratings in overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

Conclusion: SynchroRaMa successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating multi-modal emotion cues and dynamic scene descriptions, achieving superior performance in generating expressive and natural talking face videos with enhanced temporal consistency and visual realism.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

*Pei Liu,Hongliang Lu,Haichao Liu,Haipeng Liu,Xin Liu,Ruoyu Yao,Shengbo Eben Li,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniScene is a human-like 3D scene understanding framework for autonomous driving that integrates multi-view temporal perception with vision-language modeling and hierarchical fusion to achieve superior performance across perception, prediction, planning, and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems lack true 3D scene understanding capabilities similar to human vision, relying instead on depth-based 3D reconstruction. The goal is to develop a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture.

Method: Proposes OmniScene with OmniVLM vision-language model for 4D scene understanding, teacher-student architecture with knowledge distillation to embed textual representations into 3D features, and Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) for adaptive multimodal integration of geometric and semantic features.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on nuScenes dataset shows OmniScene consistently achieves superior results against over ten state-of-the-art models across perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering tasks, establishing new benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between current autonomous driving systems and human-like 3D scene understanding, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating vision-language modeling with hierarchical multimodal fusion for holistic scene comprehension.

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on camera control in perspective projection video generation, but geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains challenging due to complexities in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection.

Method: Proposes panoramic Plücker embedding for camera position encoding through spherical coordinate transformation, and a spherical epipolar module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines for cross-view feature aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Conclusion: CamPVG successfully overcomes limitations of traditional methods for equirectangular projections and enables fine-grained cross-view feature aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated panoramic videos.

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

### [129] [Improving Generalizability and Undetectability for Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19994)
*Zhifang Zhang,Jiahan Zhang,Shengjie Zhou,Qi Wei,Shuo He,Feng Liu,Lei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA) to improve generalizability and undetectability of targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models like ImageBind, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models have limitations in generalizability (limited effectiveness against partially known or semantically similar targets) and undetectability (easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods).

Method: PTA leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted adversarial examples, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. Theoretical analyses establish the relationship between generalizability and undetectability.

Result: Experimental results show PTA achieves high success rates across various related targets and remains undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

Conclusion: PTA effectively addresses the limitations of existing targeted adversarial attacks by improving both generalizability and undetectability through proxy-based optimization and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

### [130] [Anomaly Detection by Clustering DINO Embeddings using a Dirichlet Process Mixture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19997)
*Nico Schulthess,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Leveraging DINOv2 embeddings with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for efficient unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging, achieving competitive performance with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-bank approaches for anomaly detection become computationally prohibitive for large medical datasets, requiring a more scalable solution.

Method: Using DINOv2 embeddings modeled with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) to automatically determine optimal mixture components, with anomaly scores based on similarity to component centers.

Result: Achieves competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks while halving inference computation time compared to memory-bank approaches.

Conclusion: Normalized DINOv2 embeddings provide effective representations for medical anomaly detection, being well-aligned with anatomical structures even in the presence of anomalies.

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is

TL;DR: Active learning with diversity-based strategies reduces annotation costs for object detection tasks while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient data annotation is critical for machine learning, especially in object detection tasks that require extensive labeled data. Active learning can minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples.

Method: Combines uncertainty-based selection with diversity-based strategies for active learning in object detection. Evaluated on TableBank-LaTeX and TableBank-Word datasets using CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9 architectures.

Result: AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, achieving higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning approach effectively reduces annotation effort while preserving model performance, making it a practical solution for data-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

### [132] [Does the Manipulation Process Matter? RITA: Reasoning Composite Image Manipulations via Reversely-Ordered Incremental-Transition Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20006)
*Xuekang Zhu,Ji-Zhe Zhou,Kaiwen Feng,Chenfan Qu,Yunfei Wang,Liting Zhou,Jian liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RITA reformulates image manipulation localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, predicting manipulated regions layer-by-layer to model temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures of editing operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IML methods are manipulation-process-agnostic, using one-shot prediction that compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into a single binary mask, causing dimensional collapse and mismatch with the intrinsic nature of IML tasks.

Method: Proposes RITA framework that predicts manipulated regions sequentially in an ordered manner, using each step's prediction as condition for the next. Created HSIM benchmark with multi-step manipulation data and HSS metric for evaluation.

Result: RITA achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional benchmarks and provides solid foundation for hierarchical localization tasks, validating its effectiveness as a general paradigm.

Conclusion: The sequential prediction approach better aligns with the hierarchical nature of image manipulation processes, offering a more effective paradigm for manipulation localization.

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

### [133] [PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022)
*Manahil Raza,Ayesha Azam,Talha Qaiser,Nasir Rajpoot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PS3 is a multimodal fusion model that integrates pathology reports, whole slide images, and transcriptomic data using prototype-based representations to improve cancer survival prediction, outperforming existing methods on TCGA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal approaches focus on histology and genomic data, but pathology reports contain valuable complementary information. However, fusing these heterogeneous modalities (high-dimensional WSIs vs. concise text reports) presents challenges due to modality imbalance.

Method: A prototype-based approach generates balanced representations: diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports using self-attention, histological prototypes for WSIs, and biological pathway prototypes for transcriptomic data. A Transformer-based fusion model (PS3) processes these multimodal tokens to model intra-modal and cross-modal interactions.

Result: PS3 outperforms state-of-the-art clinical, unimodal, and multimodal baselines on six TCGA datasets, demonstrating improved prognostic performance for survival prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed three-modal fusion approach effectively integrates pathology reports with histology and transcriptomic data, showing that pathology reports provide valuable complementary information that enhances survival prediction in computational oncology.

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

*Lubos Mjachky,Ivan Homoliak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving authentication method using GANs to convert face images to visually private domains (e.g., flowers, shoes) while maintaining authentication utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional biometric systems lack user control over data usage and are vulnerable to data leaks and misuse without user knowledge.

Method: Uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to translate face images into visually private domains, then trains classifiers on these transformed images for authentication.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness against attacks while maintaining meaningful utility for authentication purposes.

Conclusion: The proposed GAN-based approach provides a privacy-preserving authentication solution that protects user biometric data from misuse while remaining effective.

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

### [135] [Predictive Quality Assessment for Mobile Secure Graphics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20028)
*Cas Steigstra,Sergey Milyaev,Shaodi You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to predict video frame quality for secure graphic verification, using a lightweight model to estimate utility for downstream verification tasks, with key finding that frozen ImageNet-pretrained networks generalize better to unseen printing technologies than fully fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor smartphone image acquisition of secure graphics causes high false rejection rates, creating a reliability gap in anti-counterfeiting verification systems.

Method: Proposed lightweight model to predict quality scores for video frames, validated using FNMR and ISRR metrics on 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones, with cross-domain analysis on different printing technologies.

Result: Framework effectively bridges reliability gap; key finding shows frozen ImageNet-pretrained backbone generalizes better to unseen printing domains than fully fine-tuned models, which overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Conclusion: For domain shifts from physical manufacturing processes, frozen general-purpose backbones provide more robust generalization than full fine-tuning, offering important insights for real-world deployment of secure verification systems.

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

*Yuxi Zheng,Jianhui Feng,Tianran Li,Marius Staring,Yuchuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHMoAReg is a novel expert-guided deformable image registration network that uses Mixture of Experts mechanism in both encoder and decoder to improve feature specialization and heterogeneous deformation field prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current encoder-decoder architectures for deformable image registration lack specialized feature extraction and predict deformation fields homogeneously in all three directions, limiting performance and interpretability.

Method: Proposes SHMoAReg with Mixture of Attention heads (MoA) in encoder layers for dynamic attention head selection, and Spatial Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) in decoder layers for heterogeneous deformation prediction using experts with varying kernel sizes.

Result: Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show consistent improvements, with Dice score increasing from 60.58% to 65.58% for abdominal CT dataset. Also enhances model interpretability by differentiating experts' utilities across resolution layers.

Conclusion: SHMoAReg is the first to introduce Mixture of Experts mechanism into deformable image registration tasks, achieving superior performance and improved interpretability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

*Zizheng Yang,Hu Yu,Bing Li,Jinghao Zhang,Jie Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffLI²D is a novel image dehazing method that leverages pre-trained diffusion models' latent representations to avoid retraining and iterative sampling, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational burden of retraining diffusion models and extensive sampling steps in image dehazing applications.

Method: Utilizes semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, integrating diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into a dehazing network.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to existing image dehazing methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient way to apply diffusion models to image dehazing without retraining or iterative sampling, offering a novel perspective for the field.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance on hyperspectral imaging data for autonomous driving applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform because they rely on architectures optimized for RGB inputs, failing to fully utilize the rich spectral information in hyperspectral data for robust robotic perception in challenging environments.

Method: Proposes a hyperspectral adapter with spectral transformer and spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract spatial-spectral features, plus a modality-aware interaction block that integrates hyperspectral representations with frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods while directly using HSI inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively bridges the gap between hyperspectral imaging and pretrained vision foundation models, enabling robust semantic segmentation for autonomous driving applications by leveraging the rich spectral information in HSI data.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

*Belal Shoer,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of scientific visual question answering by converting separate image-text pairs into unified 'text-in-image' format to create synthetic training data, which when used to fine-tune multimodal models yields significant performance gains across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific visual question answering is difficult for vision-language models due to complex figures and multimodal context. Existing approaches treat figures and text separately, but EXAMS-V introduced embedding both in a single image. However, even state-of-the-art models perform poorly in zero-shot settings, requiring task-specific fine-tuning, which is hindered by scarce training data in the 'text-in-image' format.

Method: To overcome data scarcity, the authors synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text pairs into unified images. They then fine-tune a small multilingual multimodal model using a mixture of their synthetic data and the EXAMS-V dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on the mixed dataset yields notable gains across 13 languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and effective cross-lingual transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of synthesizing 'text-in-image' training data from existing separate image-text pairs effectively addresses data scarcity in scientific visual question answering, enabling significant performance improvements through fine-tuning across multiple languages.

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoBench is a benchmark to evaluate sycophancy (uncritical echoing of user information) in medical LVLMs, revealing that even top models show high sycophancy rates (45-95%) despite moderate accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LVLM benchmarks focus on accuracy but overlook reliability and safety issues like sycophancy, which is critical in high-stakes clinical settings.

Method: Created EchoBench with 2,122 images across 18 departments and 20 modalities, using 90 prompts simulating biased inputs from patients, students, and physicians to evaluate various LVLMs.

Result: All tested models showed substantial sycophancy (45.98%-95+%), with medical-specific models performing worst. Higher data quality/diversity and domain knowledge reduced sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy.

Conclusion: Medical LVLMs need robust evaluation beyond accuracy; simple interventions can reduce sycophancy, highlighting the need for safer, more trustworthy models in clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

TL;DR: Pruning significantly improves the quality and faithfulness of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers compared to natural and adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected and autonomous vehicles rely on AI systems where transparency and security are critical, but post-hoc explanations often suffer from inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.

Method: Systematically examined the impact of three training approaches (natural training, adversarial training, and pruning) on post-hoc explanation quality for traffic sign classifiers through extensive empirical evaluation using saliency maps.

Result: Pruning significantly enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations by enforcing sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable and reliable decisions.

Conclusion: Pruning is a promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems, as it improves both model efficiency and explanation quality.

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

<details>

Motivation: Variations in staining and scanning introduce semantic bias, while irrelevant topological subgraphs create noise, leading to biased slide-level representations that hinder interpretability and generalization in graph-based MIL for survival analysis.

Method: Proposes C²MIL with: 1) cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention, 2) Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling for topological causal discovery, and 3) joint optimization combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning.

Result: Experiments show C²MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

Conclusion: C²MIL effectively addresses semantic bias and topological noise through dual causal modeling, providing improved generalization and interpretability for graph-based MIL in survival analysis with WSIs.

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

*Zhi Qin Tan,Xiatian Zhu,Owen Addison,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Mamba2-SSL is a semi-supervised learning framework for automated teeth and pulp segmentation in CBCT images, achieving high accuracy with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of teeth and pulp in CBCT images requires extensive expertise and is time-consuming, creating a need for automated algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data.

Method: The framework builds on U-Mamba2 model with a multi-stage training strategy: self-supervised pre-training using disruptive autoencoder, consistency regularization with input/feature perturbations, and pseudo-labeling with reduced loss weighting.

Result: U-Mamba2-SSL achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation dataset, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised learning framework effectively leverages unlabeled data for accurate teeth and pulp segmentation in CBCT images, providing a practical solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

### [144] [Optical Ocean Recipes: Creating Realistic Datasets to Facilitate Underwater Vision Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20171)
*Patricia Schöntag,David Nakath,Judith Fischer,Rüdiger Röttgers,Kevin Köser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Optical Ocean Recipes is a framework for creating realistic underwater datasets with controlled conditions to address the lack of generalizable testing environments for machine vision in underwater settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater machine vision testing is challenging due to optical distortions (color distortion, reduced contrast, blur) and variable water conditions across regions/depths/seasons. Current evaluations lack generalizability as they're conducted under specific conditions.

Method: The framework uses calibrated color and scattering additives to create repeatable, controlled underwater testing environments that simulate realistic water composition effects on image appearance.

Result: The method enables creation of ground-truth data for various vision tasks including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. A demonstration dataset is provided.

Conclusion: Optical Ocean Recipes provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic yet controlled underwater scenarios, addressing the technical impracticality of exhaustive open-water testing.

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

### [145] [Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196)
*Dehong Kong,Sifan Yu,Siyuan Liang,Jiawei Liang,Jianhou Gan,Aishan Liu,Wenqi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for Visual Language Modeling in Automated Driving that generates physically realizable camouflage textures operating in feature space to attack VLM-AD systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks have limitations: physical attacks target vision modules and don't transfer well to VLM-AD, while digital attacks don't address physical deployment. VLM-AD systems show vulnerability in encoder and projection layers.

Method: UCA introduces feature divergence loss (FDL) to maximize representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images, uses multi-scale learning strategy, and adjusts sampling ratio for better adaptability to real-world scale/viewpoint changes.

Result: UCA induces incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and scenarios, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 30% in 3-P metrics, with strong robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: UCA demonstrates high potential for practical deployment as the first physical adversarial attack framework specifically designed for VLM-AD systems, addressing the gap between digital attacks and real-world physical threats.

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

*Mahmoud Khater,Mona Strauss,Philipp von Olshausen,Alexander Reiterer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PU-Gaussian is a novel point cloud upsampling method that uses anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions to model local geometry and perform explicit upsampling through direct point sampling, followed by refinement for uniform distribution and sharp edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, creating challenges for dense 3D representations. Existing methods sacrifice geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity.

Method: Models local neighborhoods using anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions, performs explicit upsampling in local geometric domain via direct point sampling, then refines coarse output with a refinement network for uniform distribution and sharp edges.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PU1K and PUGAN datasets.

Conclusion: PU-Gaussian effectively addresses point cloud upsampling challenges while maintaining geometric interpretability and robustness to input sparsity.

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available
at https://github.com/mvg-inatech/PU-Gaussian.git.

### [147] [ImageNet-trained CNNs are not biased towards texture: Revisiting feature reliance through controlled suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20234)
*Tom Burgert,Oliver Stoll,Paolo Rota,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the established hypothesis that CNNs are texture-biased by proposing a domain-agnostic framework to quantify feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, revealing that CNNs actually rely more on local shape features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks are inherently texture-biased, which has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning.

Method: Proposed a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding confounds of forced-choice conflicts. Evaluated humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing domains.

Result: CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. This reliance can be mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures. Different domains show systematic reliance patterns: computer vision prioritizes shape, medical imaging emphasizes color, and remote sensing relies more on texture.

Conclusion: The texture-bias hypothesis for CNNs is incorrect; CNNs primarily use local shape features, and feature reliance patterns vary systematically across different application domains.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

### [148] [An Anisotropic Cross-View Texture Transfer with Multi-Reference Non-Local Attention for CT Slice Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20242)
*Kwang-Hyun Uhm,Hyunjun Cho,Sung-Hoo Hong,Seung-Won Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT slice interpolation that leverages anisotropic characteristics of 3D CT volumes by transferring high-resolution in-plane texture details to low-resolution through-plane images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT images are often acquired with large slice thicknesses due to storage and time constraints, resulting in anisotropic volumes with poor inter-slice resolution that can hinder disease diagnosis. Existing methods don't fully exploit the anisotropic nature of CT volumes.

Method: Proposes a framework with multi-reference non-local attention module that extracts features from multiple high-resolution in-plane images to reconstruct through-plane high-frequency details, effectively transferring texture across different views.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method performs significantly better than existing competing methods on public CT datasets, including a real-paired benchmark, demonstrating superior CT slice interpolation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-view texture transfer approach effectively utilizes the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volumes and provides a superior solution for improving inter-slice resolution in medical CT imaging.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhiGenesis is a unified framework for 4D scene generation that bridges video generation and novel view synthesis, producing temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations from multi-view image sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that support both temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Uses pre-trained video VAE with range-view adapter for feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images; 2) Geometric-guided video diffusion model with Stereo Forcing conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising to address exposure bias in novel views.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in appearance/geometric reconstruction, temporal generation, and novel view synthesis tasks, while delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

Conclusion: PhiGenesis successfully bridges the gap between generation and novel view synthesis, enabling temporally coherent 4D scene generation with enhanced geometric consistency and temporal extrapolation capabilities.

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

TL;DR: VersaMammo is a versatile foundation model for mammograms that addresses limitations in current models by using a two-stage pre-training strategy on the largest multi-institutional dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 92 clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for mammogram analysis have fundamental limitations including insufficient training data diversity, limited generalizability, and lack of comprehensive clinical evaluation, which constrain their clinical translation.

Method: A two-stage pre-training strategy: first training a teacher model via self-supervised learning on unlabeled mammograms, then using supervised learning with knowledge distillation to transfer features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. The model was trained on 706,239 images from 21 sources.

Result: VersaMammo achieved state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 50/68 internal tasks and 20/24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2 respectively across 5 major clinical task categories.

Conclusion: VersaMammo demonstrates superior generalization and clinical utility, representing a substantial advancement toward reliable and scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out
of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,
respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and

*Dayu Tan,Zhenpeng Xu,Yansen Su,Xin Peng,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiPerformer is a novel medical image segmentation method that addresses feature inconsistency in CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures through modular hierarchical design, Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module, and Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-Transformer hybrid methods use simple feature fusion techniques that struggle with feature inconsistencies, leading to information conflict and loss. There's a need for better integration of local details and global context in medical image segmentation.

Method: HiPerformer employs a modular hierarchical encoder for dynamic multi-source feature fusion, LGFF module for precise local-global integration, and PPA module to replace traditional skip connections for enhanced multi-scale feature representation and noise suppression.

Result: Experiments on eleven public datasets show that HiPerformer outperforms existing segmentation techniques with higher accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses feature inconsistency problems and achieves superior performance in medical image segmentation through innovative architectural design and fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a human-perception-based face similarity metric to address the limitations of existing binary identity classification models in face anonymization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face-swapping models use binary identity classification (same person or not), which fails to capture nuanced similarities needed to balance anonymity and naturalness in face anonymization.

Method: Created a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and used metric learning to predict face similarity based on human perception.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based face classification tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed human-perception-based similarity metric effectively addresses the nuanced similarity measurement needed for optimal face anonymization.

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

TL;DR: FAST is a foreground-aware diffusion framework for industrial anomaly segmentation that uses novel AIAS and FARM modules to efficiently generate high-quality, structure-specific anomalies in as few as 10 sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial anomaly synthesis methods struggle with balancing sampling efficiency and generation quality, and fail to account for statistical differences between anomaly and background regions, limiting their effectiveness for segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes FAST with two key modules: AIAS (training-free accelerated sampling using coarse-to-fine aggregation) and FARM (foreground-aware reconstruction that adaptively adjusts anomaly-aware noise in masked regions).

Result: Extensive experiments show FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods on multiple industrial benchmarks for downstream segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: FAST enables efficient, high-quality synthesis of segmentation-oriented industrial anomalies through foreground-aware diffusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced sampling steps.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

Method: The study introduces a curated dataset of 3,095 annotated deer images from the Idaho Cameratraps project. It conducts extensive comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four YOLO architectures (v8, v9, v10, v11), benchmarking performance on high-end GPU and two edge computing platforms (Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier).

Result: Real-time detection is not feasible on Raspberry Pi without hardware optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson achieves >30 FPS with GPU acceleration. Smaller advanced models (YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv9s) offer optimal balance with high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and computational efficiency (FPS > 30).

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for deploying deer detection systems in agricultural settings, demonstrating that architecturally advanced smaller models can achieve the necessary balance of accuracy and efficiency for real-world applications. The publicly available dataset and code support further research in this domain.

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

### [156] [Efficient Encoder-Free Pose Conditioning and Pose Control for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20343)
*Qi Li,Shuwen Qiu,Julien Han,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kee Kiat Koo,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances Virtual Try-On (VTON) technology by incorporating pose control through spatial concatenation of pose data, using pose maps and skeletons without adding parameters, and introduces mixed-mask training for flexible product integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for accurate VTON technology is growing, but existing models struggle with pose control challenges including optimal pose representation, integration without extra parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexibility.

Method: Builds on a baseline VTON model using pure concatenation paradigm, spatially concatenates pose data (pose maps vs skeletons) without additional parameters, and implements mixed-mask training with fine-grained and bounding box masks.

Result: Pose stitching with pose maps yields best results, improving both pose preservation and output realism. The mixed-mask strategy enables flexible product integration across varied poses.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully incorporates pose control into VTON through simple spatial concatenation, with pose maps proving most effective, while mixed-mask training enhances model adaptability across diverse conditions.

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCtrl is a physics-grounded framework for image-to-video generation that incorporates physical parameters and force control to produce physically plausible and 3D-controllable videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack physical plausibility and 3D controllability, limiting their realism and practical applications in scenarios requiring accurate physical dynamics.

Method: Uses a generative physics network with diffusion models conditioned on physics parameters and forces, representing dynamics as 3D point trajectories. Includes spatiotemporal attention for particle interactions and physics-based constraints during training.

Result: Generates realistic physics-grounded motion trajectories that drive image-to-video models, producing high-fidelity videos superior to existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: PhysCtrl successfully bridges the gap between video generation and physical realism, enabling controllable and physically accurate video synthesis across multiple materials.

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

TL;DR: EditVerse is a unified framework for image and video generation/editing using a single model that represents text, image, and video as unified token sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance through self-attention and in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity, while image tasks have successfully transitioned to unified frameworks. The authors aim to create a unified approach for both image and video modalities.

Method: Represent all modalities (text, image, video) as unified token sequences using self-attention for in-context learning and cross-modal knowledge transfer. Created a scalable data pipeline curating 232K video editing samples combined with large-scale image/video datasets for joint training.

Result: EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models. It exhibits emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities, as demonstrated through extensive experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses video editing fragmentation and data scarcity, showing that a single model can effectively handle both image and video generation/editing tasks with flexible input/output resolutions and durations.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward
unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains.
While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific
to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to
architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce
EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing
within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and
video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to
achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and
flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and
durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a
scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines
them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,
we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video
editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting
emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.

Abstract: Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the
rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for
clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach
integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge.
Our method incorporates three key extensions: adjustable initialization scales
for optimal nnU-Net complexity control, transfer learning from BraTS 2021
pre-trained models to enhance Swin UNETR's generalization on pediatric dataset,
and frequency domain decomposition for HFF-Net to separate low-frequency tissue
contours from high-frequency texture details. Our final ensemble combines
nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice

TL;DR: The paper proposes objective and subjective detectors for remote-desktop (RD) users in crowdsourced video quality assessment (VQA) to address reliability issues from workers exploiting metadata and using RD connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crowdsourcing offers efficient VQA evaluation but suffers from unreliable submissions where workers ignore instructions or game rewards, including sophisticated exploits of video metadata and rising use of RD connections that bias results.

Method: The authors develop and compare objective and subjective detectors for identifying RD users, and evaluate two mainstream crowdsourcing platforms on their susceptibility to these issues under realistic test conditions and task designs.

Result: The study compares the performance of the proposed RD detection methods across different platforms and test scenarios.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into mitigating reliability issues in crowdsourced VQA through effective detection of problematic worker behaviors like RD usage.

Abstract: Subjective video quality assessment (VQA) is the gold standard for measuring
end-user experience across communication, streaming, and UGC pipelines. Beyond
high-validity lab studies, crowdsourcing offers accurate, reliable, faster, and
cheaper evaluation-but suffers from unreliable submissions by workers who
ignore instructions or game rewards. Recent tests reveal sophisticated exploits
of video metadata and rising use of remote-desktop (RD) connections, both of
which bias results. We propose objective and subjective detectors for RD users
and compare two mainstream crowdsourcing platforms on their susceptibility and
mitigation under realistic test conditions and task designs.

*Roy Fejgin,Paarth Neekhara,Xuesong Yang,Edresson Casanova,Ryan Langman Jaehyeon Kim,Subhankar Ghosh,Shehzeen Hussain,Jason Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper investigates hierarchical strategies for improving speech generation models that use discrete acoustic codes, comparing autoregressive and MaskGIT-based transformers to capture intra-timestep dependencies while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech generation models based on LLMs face challenges with discrete acoustic codes that have multicodebook structures, where parallel prediction approaches assume independence among codebooks, leading to reduced fidelity despite efficient decoding.

Method: The study systematically compares two local transformer architectures: an autoregressive transformer for sequential codebook generation and a MaskGIT-based transformer for iterative masked prediction. Both enable frame stacking where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames jointly and the local transformer decodes their codebooks.

Result: The research characterizes tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies across different throughput and quality regimes, showing that hierarchical approaches can improve speed without compromising perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The paper proposes practical guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity, providing insights for optimizing speech generation systems.

Abstract: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically
operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens
due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N
codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple
parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among
codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced
fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer
(LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this
work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive
transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based
transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further
enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames
jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed
without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we
characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies
across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical
guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities
such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.

TL;DR: A novel multi-stage reinforcement learning framework to enhance speech summarization in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), narrowing the performance gap with text-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source MLLMs lag behind state-of-the-art text-based LLMs for speech summarization, limiting practical deployment despite their ability to generate summaries directly from speech without intermediate transcriptions.

Method: Multi-stage reinforcement learning training framework designed to improve speech summarization capabilities in MLLMs.

Result: The model delivers substantial improvements over strong baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning framework effectively enhances MLLMs' speech summarization performance, making them more competitive with text-based approaches.

Abstract: Speech summarization is a critical component of spoken content understanding,
particularly in the era of rapidly growing spoken and audiovisual data. Recent
advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), leveraging the power of
LLMs, enable generating textual summaries directly from speech without
intermediate transcriptions, while supporting controllable styles and zero-shot
generalization. However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the
state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for
speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage
reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization
capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong
baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap
with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.

Motivation: Text and time series data provide complementary views of financial markets, but effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for improved forecasting remains challenging despite their complementary nature.

Method: Proposes a unified neural architecture with modality-specific experts to learn unique time series patterns while enabling joint reasoning across modalities. Introduces cross-modal alignment framework with salient token weighting mechanism to align representations focusing on most informative tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale financial forecasting task across various unimodal and multimodal baselines. Demonstrates meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates text and time series data for financial forecasting, with interpretability methods revealing insights into time series-context value and reinforcing the cross-modal alignment design.

Abstract: Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets:
news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock
prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their
complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for
improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified
neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using
modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series
patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving
pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal
understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient
token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across
modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal
and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals
insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our
cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these
improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend music research to broader contexts by analyzing unprompted music discussions on social media platforms like Reddit, which provide rich, ecological data about music engagement.

Method: Developed Muse-it platform that retrieves Reddit data based on user queries, aggregates posts across subreddits, performs topic modeling, temporal trend analysis, clustering, and extracts music metadata from hyperlinks (Spotify, etc.).

Result: Created an accessible tool that enables music researchers to efficiently gather and analyze large-scale discourse about music, including track-level metadata and dynamic visualizations.

Conclusion: Muse-it opens new avenues for understanding music engagement as it naturally unfolds online, providing researchers with comprehensive tools for big data analysis of music-related discussions.

Abstract: Music engagement spans diverse interactions with music, from selection and
emotional response to its impact on behavior, identity, and social connections.
Social media platforms provide spaces where such engagement can be observed in
natural, unprompted conversations. Advances in natural language processing
(NLP) and big data analytics make it possible to analyze these discussions at
scale, extending music research to broader contexts. Reddit, in particular,
offers anonymity that encourages diverse participation and yields rich
discourse on music in ecological settings. Yet the scale of this data requires
tools to extract, process, and analyze it effectively. We present Muse-it, a
platform that retrieves comprehensive Reddit data centered on user-defined
queries. It aggregates posts from across subreddits, supports topic modeling,
temporal trend analysis, and clustering, and enables efficient study of
large-scale discourse. Muse-it also identifies music-related hyperlinks (e.g.,
Spotify), retrieves track-level metadata such as artist, album, release date,
genre, popularity, and lyrics, and links these to the discussions. An
interactive interface provides dynamic visualizations of the collected data.
Muse-it thus offers an accessible way for music researchers to gather and
analyze big data, opening new avenues for understanding music engagement as it
naturally unfolds online.

TL;DR: STARQA is the first public dataset for complex analytical reasoning questions requiring operations like aggregate analytics, time series analysis, and scenario understanding, evaluated using both direct SQL generation and a novel SQL+Python approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks have limited complexity and don't focus on complex analytical reasoning needed for specialized domains, creating a gap for evaluating advanced question answering capabilities.

Method: Created STARQA dataset with human-created complex analytical questions on three specialized databases, and evaluated both direct LLM SQL generation and a novel Text2SQLCode approach that decomposes tasks into SQL (data fetching) and Python (reasoning).

Result: The SQL+Python decomposition approach outperforms using SQL alone, but the dataset remains challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, indicating room for improvement in complex analytical reasoning.

Conclusion: Combining SQL and Python capabilities is beneficial for complex analytical tasks, and STARQA provides a valuable benchmark for advancing text-to-SQL systems in specialized domains requiring sophisticated reasoning.

Abstract: Semantic parsing methods for converting text to SQL queries enable question
answering over structured data and can greatly benefit analysts who routinely
perform complex analytics on vast data stored in specialized relational
databases. Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL,
the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of
expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions
involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as
calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario
understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public
human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on
three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly
using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the
task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data
fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate
that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial
compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging
for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.

*Sai Teja Reddy Adapala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal theory of computational cognitive load in LLMs, identifying Context Saturation and Attentional Residue as key mechanisms that degrade reasoning performance under cognitive load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical gap between LLMs' performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. The computational limits governing reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood.

Method: Developed Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE) benchmark to systematically manipulate cognitive load factors on multi-hop reasoning tasks. Conducted comprehensive study with 10 replications per item across 200 questions on five instruction-tuned models.

Result: Smaller models (Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B) showed 0% accuracy across all conditions. Gemini-2.0-Flash achieved 85% accuracy in controls but degraded significantly under context saturation. Cognitive load significantly contributes to reasoning failures.

Conclusion: Dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing like ICE benchmark is essential for evaluating true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

TL;DR: UserRL is a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric AI agents through standardized gym environments with simulated users, focusing on reward shaping and trajectory scoring to improve multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-trained agentic models face challenges in assisting real users due to the diversity and dynamics of user interactions, requiring better training frameworks that focus on user-centric abilities.

Method: Proposes UserRL framework with standardized gym environments and simulated users, systematically varying turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation using GRPO algorithm, tested across Qwen3 models.

Result: Key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for initial interaction ability and sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring enables more efficient multi-turn interactions; (iii) open-source simulators like Qwen3-32B are cost-effective alternatives to stronger models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, with UserRL providing a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future
research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transform static multi-agent coordination into dynamic collaboration by making agent capabilities searchable and enabling efficient task matching and decomposition.

Method: Uses Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs) for machine-readable agent profiles, semantic routing with HNSW indices, dynamic task decomposition through consensus-based merging, and smart clustering for collaborative refinement.

Result: Achieves 13x improvements over single-model baselines on HealthBench, with particularly effective performance on complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives.

Conclusion: Semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents while maintaining scalable performance.

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a real-world deployment of cooperative lane-change prediction in mixed traffic, highlighting practical challenges and lessons learned that are often missing from simulation-based studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most lane-change prediction research relies on simulations or pre-recorded datasets with simplified assumptions that don't reflect real-world conditions. There's a lack of documentation about practical challenges in real deployments.

Method: The study implements a cooperative lane-change prediction system through actual hardware deployment in mixed traffic environments, focusing on real-world implementation and testing.

Result: The deployment revealed significant practical challenges including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that significantly impacted system behavior.

Conclusion: By documenting real-world implementation experiences, this study provides valuable guidance for future work on similar systems, emphasizing the importance of addressing practical deployment challenges.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these
experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar
pipelines.

*Xingjian Kang,Linda Vorberg,Andreas Maier,Alexander Katzmann,Oliver Taubmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based agent framework is proposed to assist with CT scan protocol management by interpreting natural language requests and generating device-compatible protocol files, showing feasibility but facing limitations due to lack of unified device APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing CT scan protocols is time-consuming and requires expertise, while there's an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. The framework aims to improve workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload.

Method: The agent combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured tool-calling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate modifications based on natural language or structured requests.

Result: Experimental results show the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device-compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility for LLM-based agents in CT scan protocol management but faces limitations regarding syntactic/semantic validity due to lack of unified device APIs and challenges with ambiguous requests.

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.

*Hyunjin Cho,Giyun Choi,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: AJAHR is an adaptive 3D human mesh recovery framework that addresses the limitation of existing methods which assume standard human body structure, by incorporating amputation detection and using synthetic amputee data for robust training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human mesh recovery methods are biased against individuals with limb loss because they assume standard human body anatomy and lack appropriate training data for amputees.

Method: Proposes AJAHR framework with a body-part amputation classifier jointly trained with mesh recovery network, and introduces A3D synthetic dataset containing diverse amputee poses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results for amputated individuals while maintaining competitive performance on non-amputees.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the bias in human mesh recovery for individuals with limb loss through adaptive pose estimation and synthetic data augmentation.

Abstract: Existing human mesh recovery methods assume a standard human body structure,
overlooking diverse anatomical conditions such as limb loss. This assumption
introduces bias when applied to individuals with amputations - a limitation
further exacerbated by the scarcity of suitable datasets. To address this gap,
we propose Amputated Joint Aware 3D Human Mesh Recovery (AJAHR), which is an
adaptive pose estimation framework that improves mesh reconstruction for
individuals with limb loss. Our model integrates a body-part amputation
classifier, jointly trained with the mesh recovery network, to detect potential
amputations. We also introduce Amputee 3D (A3D), which is a synthetic dataset
offering a wide range of amputee poses for robust training. While maintaining
competitive performance on non-amputees, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
results for amputated individuals. Additional materials can be found at the

*Rui Xu,Tianyang Xue,Qiujie Dong,Le Wan,Zhe Zhu,Peng Li,Zhiyang Dou,Cheng Lin,Shiqing Xin,Yuan Liu,Wenping Wang,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MeshMosaic introduces a local-to-global framework that scales artist-designed meshes to over 100K triangles by segmenting shapes into patches and generating them autoregressively with shared boundary conditions, overcoming limitations of existing transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive generative models struggle with scaling artist-designed meshes to high triangle numbers due to long-sequence bottlenecks and limited quantization resolution, which prevent faithful reproduction of fine geometric details and structured density patterns.

Method: MeshMosaic segments shapes into patches, generates each patch autoregressively while leveraging shared boundary conditions to ensure coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions. This approach quantizes patches individually to enhance scalability.

Result: The method scales to over 100K triangles, substantially surpassing prior methods that typically handle only around 8K faces. Extensive experiments show MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in geometric fidelity and user preference.

Conclusion: MeshMosaic enables superior detail representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications by providing a scalable solution that maintains geometric fidelity and structural coherence in high-resolution meshes.

Abstract: Scaling artist-designed meshes to high triangle numbers remains challenging
for autoregressive generative models. Existing transformer-based methods suffer
from long-sequence bottlenecks and limited quantization resolution, primarily
due to the large number of tokens required and constrained quantization
granularity. These issues prevent faithful reproduction of fine geometric
details and structured density patterns. We introduce MeshMosaic, a novel
local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K
triangles--substantially surpassing prior methods, which typically handle only
around 8K faces. MeshMosaic first segments shapes into patches, generating each
patch autoregressively and leveraging shared boundary conditions to promote
coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions.
This strategy enhances scalability to high-resolution meshes by quantizing
patches individually, resulting in more symmetrical and organized mesh density
and structure. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets
demonstrate that MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both geometric fidelity and user preference, supporting superior detail
representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: KSDiff is a novel framework that combines speech feature disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for more realistic audio-driven facial animation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in talking-head generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat speech features as monolithic representations, failing to capture fine-grained roles in driving different facial motions and overlooking the importance of modeling keyframes with intense dynamics.

Method: Proposes KSDiff with a Dual-Path Speech Encoder to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related features, an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning module to predict salient motion frames, and a Dual-path Motion generator for coherent facial motion synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with improvements in both lip synchronization accuracy and head-pose naturalness.

Conclusion: The combination of speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion effectively enhances talking-head generation quality.

Abstract: Audio-driven facial animation has made significant progress in multimedia
applications, with diffusion models showing strong potential for talking-face
synthesis. However, most existing works treat speech features as a monolithic
representation and fail to capture their fine-grained roles in driving
different facial motions, while also overlooking the importance of modeling
keyframes with intense dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose
KSDiff, a Keyframe-Augmented Speech-Aware Dual-Path Diffusion framework.
Specifically, the raw audio and transcript are processed by a Dual-Path Speech
Encoder (DPSE) to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related
features, while an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning (KEL) module
predicts the most salient motion frames. These components are integrated into a
Dual-path Motion generator to synthesize coherent and realistic facial motions.
Extensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb demonstrate that KSDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in both lip synchronization
accuracy and head-pose naturalness. Our results highlight the effectiveness of
combining speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for talking-head
generation.

### [176] [MultiSoundGen: Video-to-Audio Generation for Multi-Event Scenarios via SlowFast Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining and Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19999)
*Jianxuan Yang,Xiaoran Yang,Lipan Zhang,Xinyue Guo,Zhao Wang,Gongping Huang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: MultiSoundGen is a novel video-to-audio framework that addresses limitations in complex multi-event scenarios through SlowFast Contrastive AVP for semantic-dynamic alignment and AVP-Ranked Preference Optimization for quantitative quality enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods struggle with multi-event scenarios due to poor semantic-temporal alignment and lack of quantitative preference optimization, leading to degraded performance in complex scenes with multiple sound sources and events.

Method: Proposes MultiSoundGen with two innovations: 1) SlowFast Contrastive AVP (SF-CAVP) - a dual-stream architecture aligning semantic representations and dynamic features; 2) AVP-Ranked Preference Optimization (AVP-RPO) using SF-CAVP as reward model for semantic-temporal matching and audio quality enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-event scenarios with comprehensive gains in distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

Conclusion: MultiSoundGen effectively addresses core V2A limitations in complex multi-event scenarios through innovative AVP-based alignment and preference optimization, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Current video-to-audio (V2A) methods struggle in complex multi-event
scenarios (video scenarios involving multiple sound sources, sound events, or
transitions) due to two critical limitations. First, existing methods face
challenges in precisely aligning intricate semantic information together with
rapid dynamic features. Second, foundational training lacks quantitative
preference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a
result, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered
multi-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a
novel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference
optimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining
(AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our
contributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive
AVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture.
SF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic
features of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we
integrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference
Optimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and
prioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality.
Experiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across
distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal
synchronization. The complete code and dataset will be released soon.

*Alessandro Saviolo,Jeffrey Mao,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HUNT is a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking for UAVs using relative navigation based on onboard observables, enabling high-speed flight in unknown environments without global localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV navigation methods struggle with high-speed traversal in unknown unstructured environments while maintaining target tracking capabilities under degraded sensing conditions without global localization.

Method: HUNT uses a relative navigation approach that defines objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables (attitude, altitude, velocity) and seamlessly transitions between search and tracking modes using the same perception-control pipeline.

Result: Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue scenarios demonstrated robust autonomy where global methods fail, successfully tracking vehicles and mannequins.

Conclusion: The HUNT framework provides a unified solution for high-speed UAV navigation and tracking in challenging environments without requiring global localization, addressing a key limitation in current search and rescue operations.

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both
traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once
detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global
localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation
have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible
detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field
of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time
framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single
relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard
instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling
reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same
perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor
experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue
operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where
global methods fail.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROPA is a data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB-D observations of novel robot poses with corresponding joint-space actions for bimanual manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting diverse real-world demonstrations for bimanual manipulation is costly and time-consuming, and existing data augmentation methods don't adequately address eye-to-hand RGB-D training with new action labels.

Method: Fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses, generates corresponding joint-space actions, and uses constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through gripper-to-object contact constraints.

Result: ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations across 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks (2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials), demonstrating effective scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation.

Conclusion: The method shows potential for scalable eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation data augmentation by generating physically consistent synthetic demonstrations with corresponding action labels.

Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning
requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and
scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world
demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior
works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either
eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel
images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand
(third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this
paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data
Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method
that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D
observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates
corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained
optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate
gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our
method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625
simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms
baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data
augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

TL;DR: ASP is an agentic framework that uses modern scene representations to execute open-vocabulary natural language queries for robotics, addressing limitations of end-to-end VLAs by explicitly reasoning about object affordances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end vision-language-action models struggle with complex instructions and new scenes, so an explicit scene representation is needed as a queryable interface between robots and the world.

Method: Leverages advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying capabilities of modern scene representations to implement language-conditioned robot policies, enabling zero-shot open-vocabulary query execution with explicit affordance reasoning.

Result: ASP outperforms VLAs on tabletop manipulation problems and can tackle room-level queries through affordance-guided navigation and scaled-up scene representations.

Conclusion: Agentic Scene Policies provide a capable alternative to end-to-end models by using explicit scene representations and affordance reasoning to handle complex natural language queries in robotics.

Abstract: Executing open-ended natural language queries is a core problem in robotics.
While recent advances in imitation learning and vision-language-actions models
(VLAs) have enabled promising end-to-end policies, these models struggle when
faced with complex instructions and new scenes. An alternative is to design an
explicit scene representation as a queryable interface between the robot and
the world, using query results to guide downstream motion planning. In this
work, we present Agentic Scene Policies (ASP), an agentic framework that
leverages the advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying
capabilities of modern scene representations to implement a capable
language-conditioned robot policy. ASP can execute open-vocabulary queries in a
zero-shot manner by explicitly reasoning about object affordances in the case
of more complex skills. Through extensive experiments, we compare ASP with VLAs
on tabletop manipulation problems and showcase how ASP can tackle room-level
queries through affordance-guided navigation, and a scaled-up scene
representation. (Project page:

TL;DR: EgoBridge is a co-training framework that aligns human and robot policy latent spaces using domain adaptation with Optimal Transport, achieving 44% improvement in success rates for robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric human data is valuable for robotic imitation learning, but domain gaps in appearance, sensors, and kinematics hinder knowledge transfer between human and robot domains.

Method: Uses a unified co-training framework with Optimal Transport-based domain adaptation to align policy latent spaces while preserving action-relevant information through discrepancy measures on joint features and actions.

Result: Achieves 44% absolute improvement in policy success rates over baselines, and successfully generalizes to new objects, scenes, and tasks seen only in human data where other methods fail.

Conclusion: EgoBridge effectively bridges the domain gap between human and robot data, enabling successful knowledge transfer for robotic manipulation tasks with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up
end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant
domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between
human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a
unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces
between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of
discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal
Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align
between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant
information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant
absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented
cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual
manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and
tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and

TL;DR: 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR) - a unified framework that combines geometric, visual, and semantic 3D representations to enable robots to understand human instructions and perform complex tasks through semantic queryability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform complex tasks by achieving comprehensive scene understanding that interprets 3D environments meaningfully, requiring a smart map that fuses accurate geometry with human-understandable semantics.

Method: Built on multimedia data, 3D QSR unifies three complementary 3D representations: (1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured organization via 3D scene graphs. It integrates with large vision-language models for semantic queryability using multimodal object embeddings.

Result: Evaluated through simulated robotic task planning in Unity using Replica dataset and real wet lab environment for emergency response. The framework successfully facilitates scene understanding and integrates spatial/semantic reasoning, translating human instructions into precise robotic task planning.

Conclusion: 3D QSR effectively enables comprehensive scene understanding by unifying geometric, visual, and semantic representations, demonstrating successful translation of high-level human instructions into robotic task planning in complex 3D environments.

Abstract: To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform
complex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene
understanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a
meaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric
structure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we
introduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework
built on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:
(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic
reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,
scalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,
the framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic
queryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting
object-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The
retrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream
execution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning
scenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the
indoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate
of a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for
emergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to
facilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning,
effectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task
planning in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: ReflectDrive is a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation in autonomous driving using discrete diffusion, addressing limitations of imitation learning and complex rule-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving are constrained by imitation learning limitations that struggle to encode physical rules, and existing solutions rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, simulation-limited reinforcement learning, or computationally expensive diffusion guidance.

Method: The approach discretizes the 2D driving space into an action codebook, uses pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning, and implements a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation through goal-conditioned trajectory generation and local search for unsafe token identification.

Result: Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation.

Conclusion: ReflectDrive offers a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems by providing safe trajectory generation through discrete diffusion with reflection mechanisms.

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.

*Shaofeng Yin,Yanjie Ze,Hong-Xing Yu,C. Karen Liu,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VisualMimic is a visual sim-to-real framework that combines egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control for humanoid robots, enabling zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies from simulation to real robots for diverse loco-manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for humanoid loco-manipulation either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to generalize across diverse tasks, creating limitations for real-world deployment in unstructured environments.

Method: VisualMimic uses a hierarchical approach with a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker trained from human motion data via teacher-student scheme, and a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input. Training stability is ensured through noise injection and action clipping using human motion statistics.

Result: The framework enables zero-shot transfer to real humanoid robots, successfully accomplishing various loco-manipulation tasks including box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and kicking. Policies generalize robustly to outdoor environments beyond controlled laboratory settings.

Conclusion: VisualMimic demonstrates effective integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control for humanoid robots, providing a scalable solution for real-world loco-manipulation tasks without requiring external motion capture systems.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight
integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing
approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to
generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real
framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control
for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint
tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with
a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual
and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the
low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics.
VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in
simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of
loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and
kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize
robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at:

### [184] [TIMED: Adversarial and Autoregressive Refinement of Diffusion-Based Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19638)
*MohammadReza EskandariNasab,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIMED is a unified generative framework for high-quality synthetic time series generation that combines diffusion models, supervisor networks, and adversarial training with MMD loss to capture both marginal distributions and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real time series data is often scarce, noisy, or costly to collect, making synthetic generation crucial for applications like forecasting and anomaly detection. Unlike static data, time series require modeling both marginal distributions and complex temporal dependencies.

Method: TIMED integrates: 1) DDPM for global structure via diffusion processes, 2) supervisor network with teacher forcing for autoregressive dependencies, 3) Wasserstein critic for temporal smoothness, and 4) MMD loss for feature space alignment. All components use masked attention architectures and are trained jointly.

Result: Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks show TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

Conclusion: TIMED provides an effective unified framework for high-quality time series generation by combining multiple complementary approaches to capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of sequential data.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet
challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

*Kunlun Xu,Yibo Feng,Jiangmeng Li,Yongsheng Qi,Jiahuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C²Prompt addresses class-wise knowledge coherence issues in prompt-based federated continual learning by enhancing intra-class consistency and reducing inter-class confusion during prompt communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based FCL methods suffer from class-wise knowledge coherence problems including intra-class distribution gaps across clients and inter-prompt class-wise relevance issues, which exacerbate both spatial and temporal forgetting during prompt communication.

Method: Proposes Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C²Prompt) with two components: Local Class Distribution Compensation (LCDC) to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across clients, and Class-aware Prompt Aggregation (CPA) to selectively strengthen class-relevant knowledge aggregation and alleviate inter-class confusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C²Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed C²Prompt method effectively addresses class-wise knowledge coherence issues in federated continual learning, leading to improved performance by enhancing intra-class consistency and reducing inter-class confusion during prompt communication.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

### [186] [VCRL: Variance-based Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19803)
*Guochao Jiang,Wenfeng Feng,Guofeng Quan,Chuzhan Hao,Yuewei Zhang,Guohua Liu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCRL is a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically adjusts training sample difficulty based on reward variance, addressing limitations of existing rollout-based RL methods for LLMs in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rollout-based RL methods for LLMs fail to consider different difficulty levels of samples, which contradicts the natural human learning process of progressing from easy to difficult in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: VCRL uses the variance of rollout group rewards as an indicator of sample difficulty, with moderate-difficulty samples showing higher variance. It dynamically controls training sample difficulty based on this variance metric.

Result: Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models demonstrate that VCRL outperforms current LLM RL baselines.

Conclusion: VCRL provides an effective curriculum learning approach for LLM reinforcement learning that aligns with human cognitive processes by adapting to sample difficulty levels through reward variance analysis.

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

### [187] [PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19894)
*Xueliang Zhao,Wei Wu,Jian Guan,Zhuocheng Gong,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptCoT 2.0 is a scalable framework that uses an EM loop to generate harder and more diverse reasoning problems for LLM training, achieving state-of-the-art results in mathematical and programming competitions through self-play and supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training faces a bottleneck in high-quality reasoning problems - human-curated datasets are limited and costly, while synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed rationale injection increases problem difficulty, but needed better scalability.

Method: PromptCoT 2.0 replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop that iteratively refines rationales to guide prompt construction. It supports two training regimes: Self-Play (strong models improve autonomously) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces).

Result: Applied to Qwen3-30B, achieved +4.4-6.1 point improvements on AIME/HMMT competitions and +35 Elo on Codeforces. For Qwen2.5-7B, synthetic prompts alone achieved 73.1% (AIME 24), 65.6% (AIME 25), surpassing human/hybrid data training. Problems were fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct.

Conclusion: Prompt synthesis establishes a new axis for scaling reasoning capabilities. PromptCoT 2.0 provides a scalable foundation for future open-source models, demonstrating that automated problem generation can outperform human-curated data for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at

*Matteo Cardoni,Sam Leroux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid training combining Backpropagation for initial training and Predictive Coding for online adaptation enables efficient on-device domain adaptation in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single static models are insufficient for dynamic real-world environments where input data distributions change due to factors like sensor drift or lighting variations, requiring continual model adaptation.

Method: Offline training with Backpropagation for high initial performance, followed by online adaptation using Predictive Coding to recover accuracy lost from input distribution shifts.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show effective adaptation with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments, especially suitable for resource-constrained edge devices and neuromorphic accelerators.

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world
environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes
in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations
necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by
combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method
begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to
achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed
for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to
shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness
of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational
efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic
accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a
reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining
model performance in dynamic environments.

*Ömer Veysel Çağatan,Barış Akgün*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimPO is derived as Maximum Entropy RL with length-normalized temperature, but Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online RLHF due to overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar strong performance as SimPO in online RLHF settings, given SimPO's success in offline preference optimization.

Method: Derived SimPO as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, then conducted experiments comparing Maximum Entropy RL performance in online RLHF settings.

Result: Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics in online settings, unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training. Entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and correlates with overoptimization.

Conclusion: Reference-free approaches face distinct challenges in online vs offline preference learning. SimPO succeeds offline while Maximum Entropy RL struggles online, suggesting fundamental differences between these settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be
derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized
temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method.
Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online
RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently
exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

TL;DR: Veo 3 demonstrates emergent zero-shot capabilities in visual tasks, suggesting video models may follow LLMs' trajectory toward general-purpose vision foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether video models can develop general-purpose vision understanding capabilities similar to how LLMs achieved general-purpose language understanding.

Method: Leveraging large generative video models trained on web-scale data, similar to LLM training primitives, to demonstrate zero-shot performance on various visual tasks.

Result: Veo 3 successfully solves diverse tasks including object segmentation, edge detection, image editing, physical property understanding, affordance recognition, tool use simulation, and visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Video models show promising emergent capabilities indicating they are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.
