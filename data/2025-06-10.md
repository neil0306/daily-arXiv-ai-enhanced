### [1] [How Significant Are the Real Performance Gains? An Unbiased Evaluation Framework for GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06331)
*Qiming Zeng,Xiao Yan,Hao Luo,Yuhao Lin,Yuxiang Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Bo Du,Quanqing Xu,Jiawei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in current GraphRAG evaluation frameworks and proposes an unbiased method to assess performance more accurately, revealing more moderate gains than previously reported.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GraphRAG evaluation frameworks suffer from unrelated questions and biases, leading to misleading conclusions about performance.

Method: Proposes an unbiased evaluation framework using graph-text-grounded question generation and unbiased LLM-based answer assessment.

Result: Evaluation of 3 GraphRAG methods shows more moderate performance gains than prior reports.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the need for scientific evaluations to advance GraphRAG research, despite potential remaining flaws.

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

### [2] [TESU-LLM: Training Speech-LLMs Without Speech via Unified Encoder Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06343)
*Taesoo Kim,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TESU-LLM trains speech-capable language models using only text data by aligning text and speech in a shared latent space, achieving strong performance without speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-enabled models require large-scale paired speech-text data and computational resources, limiting scalability and accessibility.

Method: Leverages a unified encoder to map text and speech to a shared latent space, aligning it with LLM embeddings via a lightweight projection network.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to models trained with multimodal data, despite using only text.

Conclusion: TESU-LLM offers a scalable and efficient approach to building speech LLMs without speech data.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

### [3] [Unified Game Moderation: Soft-Prompting and LLM-Assisted Label Transfer for Resource-Efficient Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06347)
*Zachary Yang,Domenico Tullo,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable, efficient toxicity detection system for gaming communities, using soft-prompting for multi-game support and LLM-assisted label transfer for multilingual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scalability and efficiency challenges in real-time toxicity detection across multiple games and languages.

Method: Soft-prompting for multi-game handling and GPT-4o-mini-assisted label transfer for multilingual support.

Result: Achieves macro F1-scores of 32.96% to 58.88% in non-English languages, outperforming English benchmarks. Reduces computational resources in production.

Conclusion: The unified approach is effective, scalable, and reduces overhead, successfully identifying toxic behavior in gaming communities.

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in
sanctionable behavior.

*Panagiotis Koletsis,Christos Panagiotopoulos,Georgios Th. Papadopoulos,Vasilis Efthymiou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining LLMs and statistical analysis for detecting column relationships in unlabeled tabular data, using a KG, achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advance table interpretation tasks by leveraging new technologies and benchmarks, specifically for CPA.

Method: Uses LLMs and statistical analysis (domain/range constraints, relation co-appearance) to reduce KG relation search space.

Result: Competitive performance on SemTab benchmark datasets, tested with various LLMs and prompting techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is effective and publicly available, matching state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Decision-Making of Large Language Models via Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06376)
*Heng Dong,Kefei Duan,Chongjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAC, an LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, to improve long-term decision-making in LLMs by addressing challenges in action evaluation and policy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex decision-making requiring long-term reasoning and alignment with objectives. Existing methods are limited in simulating rollouts and assessing outcomes.

Method: LAC uses token logits for Q-values, enhanced by future trajectory rollouts, and employs a gradient-free mechanism for policy improvement.

Result: Experiments in diverse environments (ALFWorld, BabyAI-Text, WebShop) show LAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' knowledge advances decision-making in multi-step environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

### [6] [Detection Method for Prompt Injection by Integrating Pre-trained Model and Heuristic Feature Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06384)
*Yi Ji,Runzhi Li,Baolei Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DMPI-PMHFE is a dual-channel framework combining DeBERTa-v3-base and heuristic rules to detect prompt injection attacks in LLMs, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and reducing attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks are a growing threat to LLMs, and current defenses lack effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: Uses DeBERTa-v3-base for semantic feature extraction and heuristic rules for structural features, fusing them via a neural network.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks in accuracy, recall, and F1-score, and reduces attack success rates in real-world LLMs.

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE offers a robust, generalizable solution for prompt injection detection in LLMs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

### [7] [Confidence Is All You Need: Few-Shot RL Fine-Tuning of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06395)
*Pengyi Li,Matvey Skripkin,Alexander Zubrey,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSC uses a model's self-confidence as reward signals for post-training, improving accuracy on math tasks without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs rely on costly human annotations or external rewards; RLSC aims to eliminate this dependency.

Method: RLSC leverages the model's own confidence as reward signals, requiring minimal supervision (8 samples per question, 4 epochs).

Result: RLSC boosts accuracy by +20.10% (AIME2024), +49.40% (MATH500), and +52.50% (AMC23).

Conclusion: RLSC provides a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on
AMC23. RLSC offers a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models
with minimal supervision.

### [8] [Natural Language Interaction with Databases on Edge Devices in the Internet of Battlefield Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06396)
*Christopher D. Molek,Roberto Fronteddu,K. Brent Venable,Niranjan Suri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a workflow using NLP and LLMs for IoBT to enhance situational awareness by querying databases in natural language and summarizing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve situational awareness in IoBT by processing device data into consumer-ready information and enabling natural language interactions.

Method: Uses LLMs for mapping natural language queries to Cypher database queries and summarizing results. Evaluated on US Army MSA data.

Result: Llama 3.1 (8B parameters) outperforms other models, achieving a 19.4% accuracy increase by relaxing Exact Match requirements.

Conclusion: The workflow enables effective natural language interactions with IoBT databases, advancing edge-based LLM deployment for critical decision-making.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

### [9] [Direct Behavior Optimization: Unlocking the Potential of Lightweight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06401)
*Hongming Yang,Shi Lin,Jun Shao,Changting Lin,Donghai Zhu,Meng Han,Qinglei Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior Optimization Paradigm, enhances LwLLMs' performance by optimizing behavior directly, outperforming GPT-3.5 on most tasks with 60% faster computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LwLLMs struggle with limited inference and reasoning capabilities, and existing prompt optimization methods are ineffective for them.

Method: DeBoP transforms complex prompt optimization into quantifiable execution sequences using gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Result: DeBoP-optimized LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks and reduce computational time by ~60%.

Conclusion: DeBoP effectively addresses LwLLMs' limitations, offering a practical and efficient solution for prompt optimization.

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

### [10] [Unintended Harms of Value-Aligned LLMs: Psychological and Empirical Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06404)
*Sooyung Choi,Jaehyeok Lee,Xiaoyuan Yi,Jing Yao,Xing Xie,JinYeong Bak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Value-aligned LLMs pose higher safety risks due to genuine adherence to aligned values, amplifying harmful outcomes. Psychological insights and in-context alignment methods are proposed to mitigate risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns in personalized LLMs aligned with human values, as such alignment may correlate with harmful information.

Method: Identified safety risks in value-aligned LLMs, analyzed psychological principles, and used a dataset with safety categories to correlate value alignment with risks.

Result: Value-aligned LLMs are more prone to harmful behavior and exhibit higher risks in safety evaluations due to genuine value adherence.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into value alignment risks and proposes in-context methods to improve safety in value-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

### [11] [SMAR: Soft Modality-Aware Routing Strategy for MoE-based Multimodal Large Language Models Preserving Language Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06406)
*Guoyang Xia,Yifeng Ding,Fengfa Li,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Fangxiang Feng,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMAR, a novel regularization technique, balances modality differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models, achieving 86.6% language retention with minimal text data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high training costs and degraded language capabilities in existing multimodal MoE models.

Method: Introduces Soft Modality-Aware Routing (SMAR) using Kullback-Leibler divergence to control routing probabilities across modalities.

Result: SMAR retains 86.6% language ability with only 2.5% pure text, outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance.

Conclusion: SMAR provides a practical and efficient solution for multimodal MoE models, balancing modality specialization and language preservation.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

### [12] [Canonical Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06446)
*Ivi Chatzi,Nina Corvelo Benz,Stratis Tsirtsis,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'canonical sampling' to ensure large language models generate canonical token sequences, improving alignment with training data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate non-canonical token sequences, leading to negative consequences. The work aims to address this by enforcing canonical tokenization during generation.

Method: The authors first establish that generating canonical sequences requires step-by-step canonical tokenization. They then propose 'canonical sampling,' a method to prevent non-canonical sequences.

Result: Canonical sampling ensures models generate only canonical token sequences and aligns the output distribution more closely with the training data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates non-canonical token generation, enhancing model reliability and consistency with training data.

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

### [13] [What Is Seen Cannot Be Unseen: The Disruptive Effect of Knowledge Conflict on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06485)
*Kaiser Sun,Fan Bai,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework evaluates LLM behavior under context-memory conflict, revealing minimal impact on non-knowledge tasks, better performance with aligned knowledge, inability to suppress internal knowledge, and increased context reliance with rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address conflicts between contextual input and parametric knowledge in LLMs, which can affect performance and evaluation validity.

Method: Proposes a diagnostic framework, constructs conflict-inducing data, and analyzes model performance across tasks.

Result: Findings show knowledge conflict's limited impact on non-knowledge tasks, better alignment performance, inability to suppress internal knowledge, and increased context reliance with rationales.

Conclusion: Highlights concerns about model evaluation validity and the need to address knowledge conflict in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

### [14] [Improving LLM-Powered EDA Assistants with RAFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06500)
*Luyao Shi,Michael Kazda,Charles Schmitter,Hemlata Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes using synthetic Q/A datasets with RAFT to enhance LLMs for EDA tasks, improving performance and addressing data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDA engineers struggle with inefficient information access, and pre-trained LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) with synthetic Q/A data and investigates RAFS for synthetic data generation.

Result: RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance for EDA tasks.

Conclusion: The approach improves LLM utility in EDA while addressing data scarcity and security concerns.

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

*Kshitish Ghate,Tessa Charlesworth,Mona Diab,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how social-group biases in vision-language models (VLMs) propagate into zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing strong correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic biases. Larger models show greater bias propagation, raising concerns for fairness in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and measure how intrinsic biases in VLMs affect downstream tasks, particularly zero-shot retrieval, and to highlight fairness concerns in AI systems.

Method: A controlled framework correlates intrinsic bias measures in VLM representations with extrinsic bias measures in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and image-to-text (ITT) retrieval tasks.

Result: Strong correlations (average ρ = 0.83 ± 0.10) between intrinsic and extrinsic biases were found across 114 analyses, with larger models exhibiting greater bias propagation. Underrepresented groups face less robust propagation.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for fairness-aware AI development, as biases in foundational models systematically propagate, disproportionately affecting underrepresented groups.

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Motivation: The lack of transparency and systematic comparisons in post-training datasets for LLMs motivates this study to analyze and improve data quality.

Method: The Magpie framework is used to annotate samples with quality metrics, and a new dataset (TuluTalk) is curated based on insights from the analysis.

Result: TuluTalk, with 14% fewer samples, matches or exceeds the performance of the original datasets on key benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for creating better post-training datasets and releases the annotated datasets and TuluTalk for future research.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### [17] [Beyond Facts: Evaluating Intent Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06539)
*Yijie Hao,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Intent Hallucination in LLMs, where models partially satisfy or misinterpret complex queries. It presents FAITHQA, a benchmark for evaluating this issue, and a metric called CONSTRAINT SCORE to detect it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to fully address complex queries, leading to partial or incorrect responses. This work aims to systematically study and measure this phenomenon, termed Intent Hallucination.

Method: The authors create FAITHQA, a benchmark with 20,068 problems, to evaluate LLMs in query-only and RAG setups. They also propose CONSTRAINT SCORE, an automatic metric for detecting intent hallucination.

Result: Intent hallucination is prevalent even in state-of-the-art LLMs, caused by omission or misinterpretation. CONSTRAINT SCORE aligns well with human evaluation for detecting this issue.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the challenge of intent hallucination in LLMs, provides tools (FAITHQA and CONSTRAINT SCORE) for evaluation, and calls for further research to address this limitation.

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

*Ho Yin 'Sam' Ng,Ting-Yao Hsu,Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan,Branislav Kveton,Nedim Lipka,Franck Dernoncourt,Dongwon Lee,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap introduces a multimodal dataset for personalized figure caption generation, improving caption quality by leveraging context from related figures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caption generation models lack personalization and multimodal context, requiring authors to revise generic outputs.

Method: LaMP-Cap provides multimodal profiles (images, captions, and paragraphs) for figures, tested with four LLMs.

Result: Using profile information improves caption quality, with images proving more helpful than text.

Conclusion: Multimodal profiles enhance personalized caption generation, outperforming text-only approaches.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

*Jacqueline He,Howard Yen,Margaret Li,Shuyue Stella Li,Zhiyuan Zeng,Weijia Shi,Yulia Tsvetkov,Danqi Chen,Pang Wei Koh,Luke Zettlemoyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Precise Information Control (PIC) to address intrinsic hallucination in LMs, proposes PIC-Bench for evaluation, and presents PIC-LM, a post-trained model improving faithfulness in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of intrinsic hallucination in LMs, where models generate unsubstantiated information.

Method: Proposes PIC, a task requiring grounded generation, and PIC-Bench for evaluation. Introduces a post-training framework for PIC-LM.

Result: State-of-the-art LMs hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. PIC-LM improves F1 from 69.1% to 91.0%.

Conclusion: PIC-LM enhances faithfulness in generation, with significant improvements in factual precision and recall.

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end framework for citation generation in LLM-based medical QA systems, proposing a multi-pass retrieval-citation method that improves citation quality and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based medical QA systems lack citation generation and evaluation, limiting their practical adoption.

Method: A novel multi-pass retrieval-citation method is introduced to generate high-quality citations.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in citation precision and recall, with evaluation results aligning with expert annotations.

Conclusion: The framework addresses challenges in citation generation for medical tasks, offering significant improvements and insights for future work.

Abstract: Existing LLM-based medical question-answering systems lack citation
generation and evaluation capabilities, raising concerns about their adoption
in practice. In this work, we introduce \name, the first end-to-end framework
that facilitates the design and evaluation of citation generation with LLMs for
medical tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a novel multi-pass retrieval-citation
method that generates high-quality citations. Our evaluation highlights the
challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while
identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the
final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation
precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we
show that evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from
professional experts.

### [21] [Training-Free Tokenizer Transplantation via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06607)
*Charles Goddard,Fernando Fernandes Neto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to transplant tokenizers in LLMs, achieving zero-shot performance preservation across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers without gradient updates, addressing cross-tokenizer challenges.

Method: Reconstructs unseen token embeddings via OMP, approximating out-of-vocabulary tokens as sparse linear combinations of shared tokens.

Result: OMP outperforms baselines in zero-shot performance, preserving model capabilities across benchmarks.

Conclusion: OMP effectively bridges tokenizer discrepancies, enabling applications like knowledge distillation and domain-specific adaptations.

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

*Alan Chen,Jack Merullo,Alessandro Stolfo,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Affine mappings between residual streams of language models enable cheap and effective feature transfer, improving SAE training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the transferability of features between small and large language models and reduce computational costs.

Method: Use affine mappings to transfer weights of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes and analyze representation spaces.

Result: Small and large models learn similar representations, enabling 50% FLOPs savings in SAE training. Transferred probes and steering vectors recover ground truth performance.

Conclusion: Feature transfer between models is feasible and efficient, with semantic and structural features transferring differently, offering insights into model representation spaces.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

*Samuel Kim,Oghenemaro Imieye,Yunting Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs and traditional classifiers for detecting depressive language in social media, finding LLMs strong in binary classification but weaker in fine-grained tasks, while LLM-generated summary embeddings outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early mental health interventions by accurately detecting depressive language in social media using LLMs and traditional classifiers.

Method: Comparison of zero-shot LLMs and supervised classifiers (using traditional and LLM-generated embeddings) across three tasks: binary depression, severity, and differential diagnosis classification.

Result: Zero-shot LLMs excel in binary classification but struggle with fine-grained tasks; LLM-generated summary embeddings outperform traditional embeddings.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for mental health prediction, with potential for better use of zero-shot capabilities and context-aware summarization.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

### [24] [BriefMe: A Legal NLP Benchmark for Assisting with Legal Briefs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06619)
*Jesse Woo,Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori,Ana Marasović,Kenneth Marino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIEFME, a dataset for evaluating language models in legal brief tasks like summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval, showing strengths in summarization but weaknesses in realistic argument completion and case retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored area of legal brief writing in Legal NLP by evaluating language models' ability to assist in legal tasks.

Method: Creation of the BRIEFME dataset with three tasks: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval, followed by analysis of model performance.

Result: LLMs excel in summarization and guided completion but struggle with realistic argument completion and case retrieval.

Conclusion: The dataset aims to spur further Legal NLP development to better assist legal professionals.

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

*Junzhe Wang,Bichen Wang,Xing Fu,Yixin Sun,Yanyan Zhao,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (MusPsy-Dataset) and model (MusPsy-Model) for multi-session psychological counseling, addressing the gap in current LLM research focused on single-session scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM research lacks focus on multi-session psychological counseling, which is more reflective of real-world practice.

Method: The authors created MusPsy-Dataset from real client profiles and developed MusPsy-Model to track client progress across sessions.

Result: Experiments show MusPsy-Model outperforms baseline models in multi-session counseling.

Conclusion: The work advances LLM applications in psychological counseling by addressing the need for sustained, multi-session engagement.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeLawBench, a legal-based benchmark for evaluating LLM safety, categorizing risks into three levels and testing 20 models, revealing gaps even in top models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of definitive standards for LLM safety evaluation due to subjective benchmarks by proposing a legal perspective.

Method: Developed SafeLawBench with 24,860 multi-choice and 1,106 open-domain QA tasks, evaluating 20 LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, and analyzing reasoning stability and refusal behavior.

Result: Top models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o scored below 80.5% accuracy; average accuracy was 68.8%. Majority voting improved performance.

Conclusion: The community should prioritize LLM safety research, as current models, including SOTA, underperform on legal-based safety benchmarks.

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores probabilistic regression with LLMs for text-to-distribution tasks like price estimation, proposing a quantile regression method to improve predictive distributions. Fine-tuned Mistral-7B outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches lack systematic comparison and focus on point estimates, missing uncertainty quantification crucial for tasks like price estimation.

Method: A novel quantile regression approach is introduced, enabling LLMs to produce predictive distributions. Mistral-7B is fine-tuned with quantile heads and tested on price prediction datasets.

Result: Mistral-7B outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and calibration, and excels over encoder architectures, embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances LLM-based regression, achieving human-level accuracy with label correction. Datasets are shared for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends learnable interventions in language models from pointwise to distribution level, improving controllability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance fine-grained control over language models by learning transformations in the concept subspace at the distribution level.

Method: Distribution-wise interventions are applied to learn transformations and surrounding regions of the concept subspace, tested on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Distribution-wise interventions outperform pointwise methods in controllability and robustness across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Distribution-wise interventions offer a more comprehensive approach for steering language model behavior.

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), focusing on Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG to address limitations of static retrieval and in-context knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the suboptimal performance of conventional RAG systems in complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning and adaptive knowledge integration.

Method: Introduces Dynamic RAG for adaptive retrieval during generation and Parametric RAG for parameter-level knowledge injection.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging research areas, offering theoretical and practical insights.

Conclusion: The tutorial aims to inspire further research in RAG by addressing current limitations with innovative approaches.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

TL;DR: DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework, outperforms existing methods in identifying LLM-generated text in specialized domains like medicine and law, addressing domain shift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detectors fail in specialized domains due to domain shift, risking misinformation and authenticity issues.

Method: Proposes DivScore, using normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation.

Result: DivScore achieves 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0% higher recall than state-of-the-art detectors.

Conclusion: DivScore is robust and effective for detecting LLM-generated text in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

*Haiqi Yang,Zhiyuan Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetNet is an efficient neural network alternative to Transformers, addressing their scalability and memory issues with a retention mechanism. It enables linear-time inference and parallel training, excelling in NLP, speech, and time-series tasks. This paper reviews RetNet's innovations, applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face scalability and memory issues due to quadratic complexity. RetNet aims to solve these problems with a retention mechanism, offering efficient long-sequence modeling.

Method: RetNet introduces a retention mechanism combining recurrence and attention, enabling linear-time inference and parallel training.

Result: RetNet achieves robust performance in NLP, speech recognition, and time-series analysis, demonstrating cross-domain effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first comprehensive review of RetNet, highlighting its innovations, applications, challenges, and future research directions.

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

*Qi Shi,Qiwei Han,Cláudia Soares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C-PATH is a conversational AI system using LLMs to help patients navigate healthcare by recognizing symptoms and recommending departments via natural dialogues. It leverages medical data and a GPT-based augmentation framework for accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify healthcare navigation and improve patient access to timely medical attention by providing an AI-driven conversational assistant.

Method: C-PATH is fine-tuned on medical knowledge and dialogue data using the LLaMA3 architecture. It includes a GPT-based data augmentation framework and scalable conversation history management.

Result: C-PATH performs well in clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy, outperforming domain-specific baselines in benchmarks.

Conclusion: C-PATH advances user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health assistance and triage.

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

### [33] [Geopolitical biases in LLMs: what are the "good" and the "bad" countries according to contemporary language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06751)
*Mikhail Salnikov,Dmitrii Korzh,Ivan Lazichny,Elvir Karimov,Artyom Iudin,Ivan Oseledets,Oleg Y. Rogov,Alexander Panchenko,Natalia Loukachevitch,Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates geopolitical biases in LLMs by analyzing their interpretations of historical events from conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, China). It introduces a dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints, revealing significant biases favoring certain national narratives. Simple debiasing methods proved ineffective, and models showed sensitivity to manipulated participant labels, sometimes amplifying biases. The work provides a framework and dataset for future research on geopolitical bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and address geopolitical biases in LLMs, particularly their tendency to favor specific national narratives when interpreting historical events with conflicting perspectives.

Method: The study introduces a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting national viewpoints. It tests LLMs' interpretations, applies simple debiasing prompts, and experiments with manipulated participant labels to assess bias sensitivity.

Result: Findings reveal significant geopolitical biases in LLMs, with limited effectiveness of simple debiasing methods. Models showed sensitivity to manipulated labels, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the persistence of national narrative biases in LLMs, challenges the efficacy of simple debiasing techniques, and provides a framework and dataset for further research on geopolitical bias.

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

*Walter Paci,Alessandro Panunzi,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' ability to detect and explain implicit content in political discourse, finding current models struggle with pragmatic tasks like interpreting presuppositions and implicatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' potential in understanding implicit content in political discourse, a largely underexplored area.

Method: Uses the IMPAQTS corpus of Italian political speeches to test LLMs via multiple-choice and open-ended tasks.

Result: All tested models struggled with pragmatic tasks, indicating a lack of key capabilities for interpreting implicit language.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack pragmatic skills for political discourse, but future enhancements are promising. Data and code are publicly released.

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at

### [35] [Extending dependencies to the taggedPBC: Word order in transitive clauses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06785)
*Hiram Ring*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CoNLLU-formatted version of the taggedPBC dataset, adding dependency annotations to its existing POS tags, and validates its utility by correlating word order data with expert typological databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the taggedPBC dataset with dependency annotations, enabling broader crosslinguistic research despite potential quality concerns.

Method: Transferring dependency information to the taggedPBC dataset and validating the results by comparing word order data with expert typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp).

Result: The dataset's word order information correlates with expert typological data, demonstrating its usefulness for corpus-based typological research.

Conclusion: Noisy but sufficiently annotated data can yield valuable linguistic insights, and the dependency-annotated corpora are made available for further research.

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

*Tianjie Ju,Yujia Chen,Hao Fei,Mong-Li Lee,Wynne Hsu,Pengzhou Cheng,Zongru Wu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' persuasion and resistance capabilities, introduces psychological strategies, and proposes an adaptive framework to improve persuasion success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study LLMs' dual capabilities in persuasion and resistance, especially in psychological rhetoric contexts, which remain unexplored.

Method: Evaluates four LLMs in adversarial dialogues, introduces eleven psychological strategies, and proposes an adaptive framework using direct preference optimization.

Result: Persuader LLMs initially use repetitive strategies with low success; explicit strategy adoption improves rates, but no universal strategy exists. The adaptive framework enhances success rates.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework effectively enables LLMs to select optimal persuasion strategies, improving success rates while maintaining general capabilities.

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

*Subhendu Khatuya,Shashwat Naidu,Saptarshi Ghosh,Pawan Goyal,Niloy Ganguly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAGAMC, a domain-agnostic generative model for multi-label text classification, uses label descriptions and a dual-objective loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual document classification is challenging due to the explosion of textual data, necessitating an efficient and versatile solution.

Method: The model generates label descriptions from input text and matches them to predefined labels using a sentence transformer, with a dual-objective loss combining cross-entropy and cosine similarity.

Result: LAGAMC achieves 13.94% and 24.85% improvements in Micro-F1 and Macro-F1, respectively, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: LAGAMC is parameter-efficient and versatile, making it suitable for practical applications in multi-label text classification.

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models struggle to reliably predict possible events over improbable ones, sometimes performing worse than chance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess language models' robustness in distinguishing possible from improbable events, separating factors like possibility, typicality, and contextual relatedness.

Method: Analyzed models like Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo under specific conditions to compare their performance.

Result: Models often assigned higher probabilities to impossible sentences than unlikely ones, performing worse than chance in some cases.

Conclusion: Language models' ability to predict event likelihood is not robust, highlighting limitations in their reasoning.

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket
by the explorer'.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy for joint control of narrative and difficulty in question generation (QG) for educational purposes, showing feasibility but noting limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QG research lacks combined control over question difficulty and narrative, which is crucial for tailored educational questions.

Method: The paper introduces a strategy for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control in QG, evaluating its feasibility and performance conditions.

Result: Preliminary evidence shows the approach is feasible but not universally effective, with identified performance conditions and trade-offs.

Conclusion: The strategy offers potential for tailored educational QG, though further refinement is needed for broader effectiveness.

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multilingual dataset (BTPD) for Bengali transnational political discourse is introduced, addressing the lack of resources for under-resourced languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in research on political discourse in Bengali, an under-resourced language, by providing a curated dataset.

Method: Hand-curated dataset collection from three online platforms using community-informed keyword-based retrieval.

Result: A multilingual dataset of Bengali political discourse, detailing topics and content.

Conclusion: The BTPD dataset enables future research on Bengali political discourse and multilingual analysis.

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such
research efforts are significantly limited in major yet under-resourced
languages like Bengali due to the unavailability of datasets. In this paper, we
present a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse
(BTPD) collected from three online platforms, each representing distinct
community structures and interaction dynamics. Besides describing how we
hand-curated the dataset through community-informed keyword-based retrieval,
this paper also provides a general overview of its topics and multilingual
content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines identity-based biases in Bengali sentiment analysis models, testing multilingual and language-specific approaches. It finds biases persist despite similar semantic content, linking findings to epistemic injustice and AI alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address understudied identity-based biases in low-resource contexts like Bengali, testing common mitigation approaches.

Method: Algorithmic audit of mBERT and BanglaBERT models fine-tuned with Bengali sentiment analysis datasets, analyzing biases in gender, religion, and nationality.

Result: BSA models exhibit biases across identity categories, with inconsistencies from combining diverse datasets and models.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges in bias mitigation, connecting to broader issues like epistemic injustice and methodological decisions in audits.

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for AudioLLMs to enhance emotion recognition through emotion reasoning, improving prediction accuracy and response coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AudioLLMs excel in semantic tasks but lack in modeling paralinguistic cues like emotion, and current emotion classification methods lack explanatory insights.

Method: A unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training is proposed.

Result: Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show improved emotion prediction accuracy and better coherence in generated responses.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates emotion reasoning into AudioLLMs, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' ability to generate test case generators for code debugging, introducing TCGBench to evaluate their performance in creating valid and targeted test cases. Results show LLMs struggle with targeted cases but improve with curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLMs' potential in code checking and debugging through test case generation, focusing on competition-level programming tasks.

Method: Proposes TCGBench, a benchmark with two tasks: generating valid test case generators and targeted ones to expose bugs. Uses state-of-the-art LLMs and a manually curated dataset for evaluation.

Result: LLMs generate valid test cases well but struggle with targeted ones. Performance improves with curated datasets via prompting or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in test case generation but need further refinement for targeted debugging, with curated datasets offering a path for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Persuasion-Augmented Chain of Thought (PCoT), a method using persuasion knowledge to improve zero-shot disinformation detection in LLMs, outperforming others by 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological studies suggest persuasion knowledge aids disinformation detection, prompting exploration of its application in LLMs.

Method: Developed PCoT, leveraging persuasion to enhance disinformation detection, and tested it on news and social media posts using novel datasets EUDisinfo and MultiDisinfo.

Result: PCoT outperformed competitive methods by 15% across five LLMs and datasets.

Conclusion: Persuasion knowledge significantly strengthens zero-shot disinformation detection in LLMs.

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

TL;DR: Trans-PEFT improves PEFT module performance on updated base models without re-tuning, reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation of PEFT modules on updated base models and reduce re-tuning costs.

Method: Focuses on task-specific patterns in Attention mechanisms, less affected by base model updates, and introduces Trans-PEFT.

Result: Trans-PEFT maintains performance on updated models without re-tuning, validated across 7 base models and 12 datasets.

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT reduces maintenance overhead and enhances PEFT module adaptability to base model updates.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the issue of reward hacking in LLMs for math problem-solving, introduces MathOlympiadEval dataset, and proposes ParaStepVerifier for better step-by-step verification of reasoning flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce correct answers via unsound reasoning, masking flaws. Existing methods fail to reliably detect these issues.

Method: Introduces MathOlympiadEval dataset and ParaStepVerifier, a step-by-step verification tool for mathematical reasoning.

Result: ParaStepVerifier outperforms baselines in detecting flawed reasoning, especially in complex problems.

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier provides a robust method for evaluating and improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: A dynamic mixture approach combines small models and LLMs for Chinese Spelling Check, improving correction precision and fluency without fine-tuning LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM methods for CSC underperform, while BERT-based models overfit. A balanced solution is needed.

Method: Dynamic mixture of small models and LLMs during beam search decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across datasets, enhancing correction and fluency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances precision and fluency, saving resources and enabling domain adaptation.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how Consonant Cluster Reduction (CCR) and ING-reduction in African American English (AAE) affect ASR accuracy, finding a small but significant impact on Word Error Rate (WER). It also shows that ASR systems without Language Models (LMs) are more influenced by lexical neighborhood effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR models often struggle with AAE features like CCR and ING-reduction, leading to misrecognition. This study aims to quantify their impact and compare ASR systems with and without LMs.

Method: The study uses the CORAAL corpus, transcribed with wav2vec 2.0 (with and without an LM). CCR and ING-reduction are detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with pronunciation expansion.

Result: CCR and ING-reduction have a small but significant effect on WER. ASR systems without LMs show stronger lexical neighborhood effects.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for ASR systems to better handle AAE features and suggest that LM-free systems may rely more on lexical neighborhood effects.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

TL;DR: A hybrid multilingual sentiment analysis model combining extractive and abstractive summarization outperforms baselines with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of standalone methods in multilingual sentiment analysis.

Method: Integrates TF-IDF-based extraction with fine-tuned XLM-R abstractive module, using dynamic thresholding and cultural adaptation.

Result: Achieves 0.90 accuracy for English, 0.84 for low-resource languages, and 22% greater computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSum, a novel algorithm for structure-aware summarization of news articles, addressing the limitations of large language models in maintaining discourse structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models often fail to preserve long-term discourse structure in news summarization, which is crucial for reader engagement.

Method: The authors develop a news discourse schema and the DiscoSum algorithm, using beam search for structure-aware summarization tailored to different social media platforms.

Result: Human and automatic evaluations show the approach effectively maintains narrative fidelity and meets structural requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully integrates discourse structure into summarization, improving quality and adaptability for diverse platforms.

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for evaluating prompt quality in LLMs, analyzing 150+ papers to identify 21 properties across six dimensions. It highlights research gaps, correlations among properties, and the impact of single-property enhancements. Instruction-tuning on enhanced prompts improves reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of consensus on quantifying natural language prompts in human-AI communication.

Method: Meta-analysis of 150+ prompting-related papers, proposing a property-centric framework and empirically testing multi-property enhancements in reasoning tasks.

Result: Single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact, and instruction-tuning on enhanced prompts improves reasoning models.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, advancing human-AI communication and prompting research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BIS Reasoning 1.0 is a Japanese dataset for evaluating belief-inconsistent reasoning in LLMs, showing performance gaps in models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover biases in LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting syllogisms, especially in high-stakes domains.

Method: Benchmarked state-of-the-art models (GPT, Claude, Japanese LLMs) on belief-inconsistent syllogisms.

Result: GPT-4o achieved 79.54% accuracy, revealing weaknesses in handling belief-conflicting inputs.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for LLMs to prioritize logical validity over intuitive beliefs in critical applications.

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for QA agents to learn to ask clarifying questions using reinforcement learning (RL), focusing on offline RL objectives for practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve QA agents by enabling them to ask clarifying questions, enhancing interaction and accuracy.

Method: Simulates conversations with clarifying questions and uses offline RL (reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning) for learning.

Result: Outperforms SFT and direct preference optimization methods in rewards and language quality.

Conclusion: The proposed offline RL approach is effective for optimizing QA agents' ability to ask clarifying questions.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A dependently-typed framework for analyzing event telicity and culminativity, applied to English sentences, formalized in Agda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cross-linguistic framework for modeling boundedness in noun phrases and telic/culminating events in verbs, with attention to entailments.

Method: Extends intensional Martin-Löf dependent type theory, with rules formalized in Agda. Analyzes nominal boundedness and verbal event calculus.

Result: A formalized framework for linguistic analysis, demonstrating how boundedness and event properties interact.

Conclusion: The framework successfully models linguistic phenomena, with potential for broader cross-linguistic application.

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs truly reason or rely on shallow patterns by testing their robustness against adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Results show significant performance variations, highlighting fragility and the need for better reasoning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs genuinely reason or exploit statistical patterns, and to assess their robustness under adversarial prompt modifications.

Method: Introduces semantically faithful but adversarially structured prompt perturbations (e.g., storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraints) and evaluates 700 perturbed code generations from LeetCode-style problems.

Result: Performance varies widely: some perturbations degrade accuracy by up to 42.1%, while others improve it by 35.3%, revealing sensitivity to prompt dynamics.

Conclusion: Current reasoning systems are fragile and unpredictable, emphasizing the need for principled approaches to robust prompting and reasoning alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses misinformation in scientific tables by proposing a modular reasoning approach (atomic skills) to reduce cognitive load, outperforming GPT-4o with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific tables can mislead non-experts due to their complexity. Existing models lack precision in verifying claims, prompting the need for better reasoning methods.

Method: Introduces a skill-chaining schema using modular atomic skills to reduce cognitive load and improve reasoning. Evaluated on SciAtomicBench, a cross-domain benchmark.

Result: The model, trained with only 350 examples, surpasses GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: Modular reasoning with atomic skills enhances claim verification in scientific tables, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack in-depth insights for complex reasoning tasks due to limited training data. CoM aims to bridge this gap by leveraging human-like methodologies.

Method: CoM uses a prompting framework to activate systematic reasoning in LLMs through user-defined methodologies, avoiding explicit fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show CoM outperforms baselines, proving its effectiveness for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: CoM demonstrates the potential of training-free prompting methods to achieve human-level reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks
and bridging the gap toward human-level reasoning through human-like
methodological insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiMM, a multicultural multimodal metaphor dataset for Chinese and English, and proposes SEMD, a sentiment-enriched metaphor detection model, to address cultural bias in NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing, especially in multimodal contexts, and provide a fairer, more inclusive approach.

Method: Developed MultiMM dataset (8,461 text-image pairs) and SEMD model integrating sentiment embeddings for cross-cultural metaphor detection.

Result: SEMD shows effectiveness in metaphor detection and sentiment analysis, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The work highlights cultural bias in NLP and advances fairer, more inclusive language models.

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are
available at https://github.com/DUTIR-YSQ/MultiMM.

TL;DR: FoReaL-Decoding reduces FLOPs and CoT length while maintaining performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overthinking phenomenon and token-level misalignment in large reasoning models.

Method: Proposes FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method with a stochastic gate.

Result: Reduces FLOPs by 30-50% and CoT length by up to 40%, preserving 86-100% performance.

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding offers a simple, plug-and-play solution for cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

TL;DR: Adversarial Paraphrasing is a training-free attack framework that humanizes AI-generated text to evade detection, outperforming simple paraphrasing and reducing detection rates significantly across various systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of AI-generated text detectors to evasion techniques like paraphrasing, this work introduces a more sophisticated attack method to highlight the need for robust detection strategies.

Method: The approach uses an instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated text under the guidance of an AI text detector, creating adversarial examples optimized to bypass detection.

Result: The attack reduces detection rates by 64.49% on RADAR and 98.96% on Fast-DetectGPT, with an average reduction of 87.88% across diverse detectors, while maintaining text quality.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity for more resilient detection methods as evasion techniques grow more advanced.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

Motivation: Existing LMMs are predominantly English-focused, lacking cultural and linguistic inclusivity, especially for video content. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: Developed ViMUL-Bench with 8k manually verified samples across 14 languages and 15 culturally diverse categories. Also created a 1.2M-sample multilingual training set and a simple multilingual video LMM (ViMUL).

Result: ViMUL provides a balanced tradeoff between high- and low-resource languages for video understanding.

Conclusion: The work facilitates future research in inclusive multilingual video LMMs by releasing ViMUL-Bench, ViMUL, and training data publicly.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intelligent consultation system for communication standards by combining fine-tuned large language models (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) with a knowledge graph, achieving significant performance improvements and practical application value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consulting models are slow and expert-dependent, failing to meet rapid technological demands. The paper aims to automate and enhance the process using AI.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on 6,587 QA pairs and built a knowledge graph (13,906 entities, 13,524 relations) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Result: BLEU-4 improved from 18.8564 to 66.8993; ROUGE scores also rose. The RAG framework boosted scores by 2.26% on average.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates strong performance and practical value, outperforming comparison models like Llama-3-8B-Instruct.

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

Method: Uses multiple LLMs with three strategies: base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and RAG. Evaluates performance on Thucydides' texts and translates RDF into Coq for higher-order reasoning.

Result: Enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions. Base generation excels in coverage, while RAG improves precision. Larger models show robust performance, while Llama 3.2 varies widely. Coq formalization validates RAG-discovered event types.

Conclusion: The approach automates historical event extraction and enables advanced reasoning, with enhancement strategies tailored to specific needs. Coq integration validates semantic structures beyond RDF capabilities.

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lingshu, a medical-specialized MLLM, addressing limitations in existing models by proposing a comprehensive data curation procedure and multi-stage training. It also develops MedEvalKit for standardized evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack effectiveness in medical applications due to discrepancies in data and tasks, limited medical knowledge coverage, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inadequate reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes a data curation procedure for rich medical knowledge, multi-stage training for Lingshu, and explores reinforcement learning for reasoning. Introduces MedEvalKit for evaluation.

Result: Lingshu outperforms existing open-source multimodal models on tasks like multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation.

Conclusion: The approach enhances medical MLLMs by addressing key limitations, demonstrating superior performance in medical tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

*Kai Xiong,Xiao Ding,Yixin Cao,Yuxiong Yan,Li Du,Yufei Zhang,Jinglong Gao,Jiaqian Liu,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Com$^2$, a benchmark for complex commonsense reasoning, addressing LLMs' limitations in handling implicit knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in simple commonsense reasoning but struggle with complex, implicit knowledge, which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: The authors use causal event graphs and causal theory to structure complex commonsense, synthesize examples via LLMs, and create a subset with detective stories.

Result: Experiments reveal LLMs' shortcomings in reasoning depth and breadth, though post-training and slow thinking help.

Conclusion: Com$^2$ fills a gap in evaluating complex commonsense reasoning, highlighting LLMs' limitations and potential improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code
and data are available at https://github.com/Waste-Wood/Com2.

*Yuanhe Tian,Pengsen Cheng,Guoqing Jin,Lei Zhang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based approach for multi-modal affective computing decomposes visual and textual representations into shared and modality-specific components, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to capture complex cross-modal interactions in affective computing, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The method encodes and aligns modalities, decomposes representations into shared and unique components, and integrates them via attention for a multi-modal LLM.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art models in tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and hateful meme detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses multi-modal affective computing challenges by leveraging decomposed representations and LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

*Jiaxuan Gao,Shu Yan,Qixin Tan,Lu Yang,Shusheng Xu,Wei Fu,Zhiyu Mei,Kaifeng Lyu,Yi Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Reasoning Efficiency Gap (REG) metric to assess the efficiency of fine-tuned Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and proposes REO-RL, a Reinforcement Learning method, to reduce REG by optimizing token budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs produce verbose reasoning traces, leading to high inference costs and impractical deployment. Existing fine-tuning methods lack consistent evaluation of efficiency gains.

Method: The authors propose REG as a unified metric and REO-RL, a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, to minimize REG by targeting sparse token budgets. Numerical integration is used to approximate efficiency objectives.

Result: REO-RL reduces REG by >=50% across LRMs and matches efficiency frontiers under tight token budgets with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LRMs to align perfectly with efficiency frontiers remains challenging, but REO-RL significantly improves reasoning efficiency.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

*Samir Abdaljalil,Hasan Kurban,Khalid Qaraqe,Erchin Serpedin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToTh is a novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three agents (abductive, deductive, inductive) to enhance LLM reasoning, outperforming CoT and others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack logical structure and coherence in reasoning. ToTh aims to address this by introducing structured, collaborative reasoning.

Method: ToTh uses three parallel agents for distinct inference modes, structures reasoning into graphs, and evaluates coherence via Bayesian belief propagation and NLI.

Result: ToTh outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding on symbolic and numerical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToTh offers a robust, interpretable, and cognitively inspired approach to LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting's effectiveness, finding it varies by task and model type, with mixed results on performance, variability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide business, education, and policy leaders with insights into AI techniques like CoT prompting through rigorous testing.

Method: Investigates CoT prompting's impact on large language models (LLMs) by analyzing task performance, variability, and efficiency across different model types.

Result: CoT improves non-reasoning models slightly but increases variability and errors. For reasoning models, gains are marginal, while costs (time and tokens) rise significantly.

Conclusion: CoT prompting's benefits are context-dependent, with trade-offs in performance, consistency, and efficiency, suggesting careful consideration for its use.

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data augmentation strategy using LLMs for the ACSA task, ensuring semantic consistency and linguistic diversity, and proposes a confidence-weighted fine-tuning method, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in low-resource scenarios for ACSA tasks by leveraging LLMs for effective data augmentation.

Method: Uses structured prompt templates with LLMs for data augmentation, post-processing for semantic consistency, and confidence-weighted fine-tuning for better predictions.

Result: Achieves best performance on four benchmark datasets compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances model understanding of aspect-sentiment relationships and improves inference capabilities.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sampling algorithm based on posterior inference to control syntactic structure in text generation, improving syntactic accuracy without losing fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enforcing target syntactic structures in text generation for clarity, style, or interpretability.

Method: Combines sequential Monte Carlo for posterior distribution estimation with a syntactic tagger to align tokens with desired structures.

Result: Achieves ~93 F1 score for syntactic accuracy in GPT2 and Llama3-8B models, up from 12.31 and 35.33, respectively.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of sampling algorithms for precise syntactic control, offering promise for applications requiring such precision.

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a reinforcement learning framework, to improve geometric reasoning in smaller LLMs by optimizing auxiliary construction and reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry problem-solving in LLMs is challenging due to suboptimal performance or high computational costs of large models. The paper aims to train smaller models effectively.

Method: Proposes GCPO with Group Contrastive Masking and length rewards to guide auxiliary construction and reasoning chains. Develops GeometryZero models based on GCPO.

Result: GeometryZero outperforms baselines (e.g., GRPO) by 4.29% on benchmarks like Geometry3K and MathVista.

Conclusion: GCPO and GeometryZero offer an efficient solution for geometric reasoning, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

Motivation: Address the high resource demands of training large NLP models by optimizing data efficiency through IS.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of IS methods for Automatic Text Classification (ATC), proposing noise-oriented and redundancy-aware IS solutions for large datasets and transformers.

Result: 41% average reduction in training sets with maintained effectiveness and up to 2.46x speedup.

Conclusion: IS has untapped potential for cost-effective NLP training, with proposed solutions offering scalable efficiency.

Abstract: Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule
of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x
(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of

TL;DR: RULE is a Reinforcement UnLearning framework for LLMs that efficiently removes specific information without retraining, using minimal forget data and synthesized queries, outperforming existing methods in forget quality and naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about sensitive, copyrighted, or illegal content in LLMs drive the need for selective unlearning without degrading model utility.

Method: RULE formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem, using a verifiable reward function and minimal forget set and synthesized boundary queries.

Result: RULE achieves up to 17.5% better forget quality and 16.3% better naturalness, maintaining general utility and Pareto optimality.

Conclusion: RULE effectively unlearns targeted information while improving response naturalness, training efficiency, and generalization.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISE, a benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in Video-LLMs, addressing the lack of systematic assessments in the video-language domain. It also explores key-frame selection as a mitigation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-LLMs often align with user input even when it contradicts visual evidence, undermining trustworthiness. Current research lacks benchmarks for sycophancy in this domain.

Method: Proposes VISE, a benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in Video-LLMs across diverse question formats and tasks. Introduces key-frame selection as a mitigation strategy.

Result: VISE enables fine-grained analysis of sycophantic behavior and suggests key-frame selection can reduce bias by improving visual grounding.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for targeted evaluations of Video-LLMs and offers a practical approach to mitigate sycophantic behavior.

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

TL;DR: SDE-SQL enables LLMs to dynamically explore databases during inference using SQL probes, improving Text-to-SQL performance without relying on pre-processed data or in-context demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods limit LLMs by using static database info, preventing autonomous exploration. SDE-SQL addresses this by allowing dynamic interaction.

Method: SDE-SQL generates and executes SQL probes for active database retrieval, updating the model's understanding iteratively in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Achieves 8.02% relative improvement in execution accuracy on BIRD benchmark with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, setting a new SOTA for open-source models without SFT.

Conclusion: SDE-SQL enhances LLM performance in Text-to-SQL tasks through dynamic exploration, with further gains possible via SFT.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving near-identical accuracy with a 0.33% drop, reducing input size by 50% and latency by 43%.

Conclusion: Significant context reduction is feasible without performance loss, making the method practical for real-world tasks.

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

### [78] [Bias Attribution in Filipino Language Models: Extending a Bias Interpretability Metric for Application on Agglutinative Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07249)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper adapts a bias attribution metric for agglutinative languages like Filipino, revealing differences in bias themes between Filipino and English models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend bias attribution research to agglutinative languages and compare bias themes in Filipino and English models.

Method: Adapts an information-theoretic bias attribution score for Filipino and tests it on a Filipino model and three multilingual models.

Result: Filipino models show bias from words about people, objects, and relationships, unlike action-heavy themes in English models.

Conclusion: Bias processing differs between English and non-English models, highlighting language-specific themes.

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

### [79] [Question Answering under Temporal Conflict: Evaluating and Organizing Evolving Knowledge with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07270)
*Atahan Özer,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of LLMs in handling evolving knowledge by introducing benchmarks and a lightweight framework for structured external memory, improving performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' knowledge is static and outdated due to pre-training data limitations, making re-training or in-context learning impractical for evolving information.

Method: Introduces Temporal Wiki and Unified Clark benchmarks to test LLMs on temporal data and proposes a lightweight framework for structured external memory.

Result: LLMs struggle with conflicting facts; the proposed framework outperforms ICL and RAG baselines, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The lightweight framework effectively handles evolving knowledge without re-training, improving LLM performance on temporal and conflicting data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

*Olga Kellert,Nemika Tyagi,Muhammad Imran,Nelvin Licona-Guevara,Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based tool for annotating code-switched text with Universal Dependencies, achieving high accuracy and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of syntactic analysis tools for code-switched text, especially in low-resource languages, and improving upon monolingual parsers' limitations.

Method: Develops a prompt-based framework using few-shot LLM prompting and expert review, releases annotated datasets, and analyzes syntactic switch points.

Result: BiLingua Parser achieves 95.29% LAS after expert revision, surpassing prior baselines and multilingual parsers.

Conclusion: LLMs, when guided properly, can effectively bootstrap syntactic resources for code-switched and low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and

### [81] [Exploring the Impact of Temperature on Large Language Models:Hot or Cold?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07295)
*Lujun Li,Lama Sleem,Niccolo' Gentile,Geoffrey Nichil,Radu State*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of sampling temperature on LLM performance across different model sizes and proposes a BERT-based selector for optimal temperature, improving results in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent research shows LLMs understand semantics, not just memorize data, with temperature playing a key role. This study aims to systematically assess temperature's impact on model performance.

Method: Evaluated temperature (0-2) on datasets testing six capabilities, analyzed open-source models of small (1B-4B), medium (6B-13B), and large (40B-80B) sizes. Proposed a BERT-based temperature selector.

Result: Temperature has skill-specific effects on performance. The BERT selector improved small/medium models in SuperGLUE. FP16 precision and 4-bit quantized models showed consistent temperature effects. Mutation Temperature rises with model size.

Conclusion: Optimal temperature selection is complex but crucial. The BERT-based selector offers a practical solution, especially for smaller models, and temperature effects remain consistent across precision levels.

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

### [82] [Subjectivity in the Annotation of Bridging Anaphora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07297)
*Lauren Levine,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores subjectivity in annotating bridging anaphora, proposing a new classification system and revealing under-annotation in prior resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the challenges of consistent annotation for bridging anaphora due to its subjective nature.

Method: Conducted an annotation pilot on the GUM corpus test set and developed a new bridging subtype classification system.

Result: Found prior resources likely under-annotated, moderate agreement on subtypes, and low annotator overlap due to subjectivity.

Conclusion: Highlights the complexity of bridging annotation and the need for improved frameworks to address subjectivity.

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fine-tuning strategy called ConfQA reduces LLM hallucination from 20-40% to under 5% by training models to admit uncertainty when unsure and using dampening prompts and factual statements for confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs hallucinating factual statements, aiming to improve their reliability and accuracy.

Method: ConfQA fine-tuning: trains LLMs to admit 'I am unsure' for incorrect answers and continue with correct ones. Uses dampening prompts and factual statements for confidence calibration. Introduces the Dual Neural Knowledge framework.

Result: Hallucination rate drops to under 5%, with potential accuracy gains beyond 95% and 30% fewer unnecessary external retrievals.

Conclusion: ConfQA effectively reduces hallucination and improves LLM reliability, with the Dual Neural Knowledge framework enhancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

*Brian Christian,Hannah Rose Kirk,Jessica A. F. Thompson,Christopher Summerfield,Tsvetomira Dumbalska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reward models in large language models, revealing inconsistencies, biases, and sensitivities in their scoring of human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interpretability and reliability of reward models in encoding human values, given their understudied nature despite their critical role in aligning language models.

Method: Exhaustive analysis of reward models' responses across their entire vocabulary space, examining single-token responses to value-laden prompts.

Result: Found heterogeneity between models, asymmetries in scoring, sensitivity to prompt framing, and biases toward certain identity groups.

Conclusion: Reward models are not interchangeable or reliable proxies for human values, and their biases risk propagating through deployed language models.

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

*Anyi Wang,Dong Shu,Yifan Wang,Yunpu Ma,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRPS is a new framework for enhancing LLM reasoning by manipulating internal features linked to role-playing, outperforming traditional prompt methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing role-playing methods lack stability and interpretability, prompting the need for a more controlled and insightful approach.

Method: SRPS extracts latent representations from prompts, selects key features, and injects a steering vector into the model's residual stream.

Result: SRPS improves reasoning accuracy, e.g., Llama3.1-8B on CSQA (31.86% to 39.80%) and Gemma2-9B on SVAMP (37.50% to 45.10%).

Conclusion: SRPS enhances LLM reasoning with better interpretability and stability than prompt-based methods.

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

*Seokil Ham,Yubin Choi,Seungju Cho,Yujin Yang,Younghun Kim,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReFT, a model that filters harmful prompts during finetuning of LLMs by leveraging refusal features, ensuring safety-alignment and task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning-as-a-Service is vulnerable to harmful prompts in user data, degrading LLM safety-alignment. Existing solutions lack fundamental filtering methods.

Method: Proposes ReFT, which identifies harmful prompts using refusal features from safety-aligned LLMs and filters them during finetuning.

Result: ReFT-based finetuning reduces harmful outputs and improves task-specific accuracy, ensuring secure LLM deployment.

Conclusion: ReFT offers a practical solution for maintaining safety-alignment and reliability in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED automates evidence generation for text-to-SQL tasks, improving accuracy and usability without relying on human-provided evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-SQL models depend on human-provided evidence (BIRD dataset), which assumes user expertise and contains defects, limiting real-world practicality.

Method: SEED automatically extracts and generates evidence by analyzing database schema, description files, and values.

Result: SEED improves SQL generation accuracy in no-evidence scenarios and sometimes outperforms models using BIRD evidence.

Conclusion: SEED enhances text-to-SQL adaptability and robustness, bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between high-performance LLMs and efficient SLMs for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Integrates a frozen LLM layer into an SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for specific tasks.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across NLP tasks, better generalization, and efficient knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: PiFi effectively leverages LLM strengths in SLMs, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic
abilities.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Magri's unresolved puzzle about conjunction, focusing on infelicitous sentences like "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond." It attributes the oddness to collective/concurrent readings and suggests broader pragmatic mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Magri's first puzzle about conjunction, which involves unexplained infelicity in certain sentences, and explore hidden interactions among quantification, interpretation, and context.

Method: Conceptual analysis within Magri's theoretical framework, examining collective/concurrent interpretations and pragmatic mechanisms.

Result: The oddness arises from indirect contextual contradictions in collective/concurrent readings, implicating broader pragmatic mechanisms than current accounts capture.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations in exhaustification-based accounts and suggests extending pragmatic theories to explain such conjunction puzzles.

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weak-to-Strong Decoding (WSD), a framework to improve LLM alignment by using a small aligned model to draft well-aligned beginnings, followed by a larger base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in low-resource LLM alignment, ensuring high-quality and aligned content without degrading downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes WSD, where a small aligned model drafts aligned beginnings, and a larger base model continues, controlled by an auto-switch mechanism. Uses GenerAlign dataset to fine-tune Pilot-3B as the draft model.

Result: WSD outperforms baseline methods, avoids alignment tax, and maintains downstream task performance.

Conclusion: WSD effectively enhances LLM alignment, balancing quality and efficiency, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and high-quality embedding generation method that generalizes across both IR and non-IR tasks without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Combines in-context learning, soft supervision (using continuous relevance scores), and adaptive margin-based hard-negative mining with a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B).

Result: Achieves strong generalization on the MTEB benchmark (41 tasks), ranking among top models and outperforming larger or fully fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive sampling for scalable and high-quality embedding generation.

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive
sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

TL;DR: DALTA introduces domain adaptation for low-resource topic modeling, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in coherence, stability, and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic models struggle in low-resource settings due to unstable and incoherent topic inference.

Method: DALTA uses a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment for selective knowledge transfer.

Result: Experiments show DALTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in topic coherence, stability, and transferability.

Conclusion: DALTA effectively addresses low-resource topic modeling challenges through domain adaptation.

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

*Yuxin Xiao,Shan Chen,Jack Gallifant,Danielle Bitterman,Thomas Hartvigsen,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KScope, a framework to classify LLM knowledge into five statuses and analyzes how context affects knowledge updates across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand LLM knowledge beyond conflicts, by characterizing its consistency and correctness.

Method: Proposes KScope, a hierarchical framework of statistical tests to classify LLM knowledge into five statuses, applied to nine LLMs across four datasets.

Result: Finds that context narrows knowledge gaps, specific features drive updates, and LLMs diverge in behavior when consistently wrong. Summarization and credibility improve updates.

Conclusion: KScope effectively characterizes LLM knowledge, with context and feature analysis enhancing update effectiveness across models.

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

*Siddartha Devic,Tejas Srinivasan,Jesse Thomason,Willie Neiswanger,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, identifying three flaws: low ecological validity benchmarks, focus on epistemic uncertainty, and non-utility metrics. It advocates for user-centric UQ practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-LLM collaboration by addressing shortcomings in current UQ methods for LLMs, ensuring reliability and trust in real-world applications.

Method: Analyzed 40 LLM UQ methods, identifying three key issues and proposing user-centric solutions.

Result: Found current UQ practices are misaligned with real-world user needs, suggesting a shift toward human-centered approaches.

Conclusion: Advocates for adopting user-centric UQ practices to enhance LLM reliability and trust in real-world decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

*Guang Liu,Liangdong Wang,Jijie Li,Yang Yu,Yao Xu,Jiabei Chen,Yu Bai,Feng Liao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCI4.0 is a large-scale bilingual dataset for pre-training, featuring high-quality data and diverse reasoning templates, improving LLM performance in tasks like math and coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for superior data quality and diverse reasoning in pre-training datasets, ensuring cleaner and more reliable training signals for LLMs.

Method: Proposes a pipeline for data quality justification, including deduplication, quality scoring, and fluency filtering, and introduces staged CoT extraction for diverse reasoning patterns.

Result: LLMs pre-trained on CCI4.0 show consistent improvements in downstream tasks, particularly in math and code reflection.

Conclusion: Rigorous data curation and human-like reasoning templates are crucial for advancing LLM performance, offering insights into automated corpus processing.

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

*Haoyuan Li Yusen Zhang,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FairPO is a method for improving fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) at both summary and corpus levels, outperforming baselines while maintaining summary quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in MDS is critical to avoid biased representations, such as overrepresenting negative reviews, which can mislead decision-making.

Method: FairPO uses preference tuning: perturbing document sets for summary-level fairness and dynamically adjusting weights for corpus-level fairness.

Result: FairPO outperforms baselines in fairness while preserving summary quality.

Conclusion: FairPO effectively addresses fairness in MDS at both levels, offering a balanced approach for unbiased summarization.

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The
code is available at https://github.com/leehaoyuan/coverage_fairnes.

TL;DR: GA LLM combines Genetic Algorithms and Large Language Models for structured generation tasks, improving constraint satisfaction and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of using language models alone for structured tasks by integrating genetic algorithms for better optimization and structural integrity.

Method: Hybrid framework where outputs are treated as genes; evolutionary operations (selection, crossover, mutation) are guided by the language model for iterative improvement.

Result: Effective in tasks like itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting, producing well-structured and requirement-satisfying results.

Conclusion: GA LLM outperforms standalone language models by leveraging the strengths of both genetic algorithms and language models for structured generation.

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEBATE, a Chinese speech-text dataset for studying disambiguation through speech (DTS), highlighting gaps in existing research and benchmarking models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality datasets for studying how speech cues resolve textual ambiguity.

Method: Created DEBATE, a dataset of 1,001 ambiguous utterances recorded by 10 native speakers, with detailed data collection and quality analysis.

Result: Benchmarked models show significant performance gaps between machine and human understanding of spoken intent.

Conclusion: DEBATE is a pioneering dataset for DTS research, with potential for cross-language and cultural applications.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

TL;DR: Survey in Indonesia reveals machine translation and information retrieval are top priorities for local language NLP, but privacy and bias concerns need addressing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia for language technology, as current NLP efforts are costly and lack clarity on community priorities.

Method: Conducted a nationwide survey to assess the needs and concerns of native speakers regarding language technology.

Result: Machine translation and information retrieval are critical needs, but privacy, bias, and data transparency are significant concerns.

Conclusion: Clear communication and transparency are essential to address concerns and support broader AI adoption in Indonesia's local languages.

Abstract: There is an emerging effort to develop NLP for Indonesias 700+ local
languages, but progress remains costly due to the need for direct engagement
with native speakers. However, it is unclear what these language communities
truly need from language technology. To address this, we conduct a nationwide
survey to assess the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia. Our findings
indicate that addressing language barriers, particularly through machine
translation and information retrieval, is the most critical priority. Although
there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI
adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance NE correction in ASR systems by addressing noisy NE candidates.

Method: Extends RAGEC with synthetic denoising rationales, phonetic similarity, and augmented definitions, using in-context learning.

Result: 28% relative WER reduction and improved NE hit ratio on CommonVoice and STOP datasets.

Conclusion: DeRAGEC outperforms baseline ASR and RAGEC, requiring no additional training.

Abstract: We present DeRAGEC, a method for improving Named Entity (NE) correction in
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By extending the
Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC
employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before
correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it
refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional
training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show
significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio,
outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28%
relative reduction in WER compared to ASR without postprocessing. Our source

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSCB, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated explanations, and proposes a new metric to improve explanation quality via DPO fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistencies in LLM post-hoc explanations by providing a scalable evaluation method.

Method: Develop PSCB benchmark, analyze self-consistency, propose a new metric, and fine-tune LLMs with DPO.

Result: Self-consistency scores don't differ between correct/incorrect predictions; new metric improves explanation alignment.

Conclusion: PSCB and DPO offer a scalable path to more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

TL;DR: A compression technique is proposed to reduce sequence length caused by byte-level fallbacks in subword tokenization, addressing inefficiencies in CJK and emoji contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byte-level fallbacks increase sequence length for long-tail tokens in CJK and emoji contexts, leading to computational inefficiencies.

Method: A simple, lossless compression technique is introduced.

Result: The technique reduces sequence length without losing information.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates computational inefficiencies in tokenization for diverse character sets.

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

TL;DR: SELT enhances LLM reasoning using a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search, improving accuracy and robustness without external rewards or task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks; SELT aims to improve their performance without relying on external reward models.

Method: SELT uses a modified MCTS with intrinsic self-evaluation and semantic clustering to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: SELT outperforms baselines on benchmarks like MMLU and Seal-Tools, improving accuracy and reasoning robustness.

Conclusion: SELT is a generalizable framework for enhancing LLM reasoning, validated by strong performance on diverse tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored application of LLMs in context-aware machine translation.

Method: Literature review of prompting, fine-tuning, automatic post-editing, and translation agents.

Result: Commercial LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) outperform open-source ones (e.g., Llama); prompt-based approaches are effective baselines.

Conclusion: Identifies gaps and suggests future directions for context-aware translation with LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application
to machine translation is relatively underexplored, especially in context-aware
settings. This work presents a literature review of context-aware translation
with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches,
with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for
context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such
as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs
(such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good
baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some
interesting future directions to explore.

TL;DR: The paper explores alternatives to traditional instruction adaptation for low-resource languages, using Basque as a case study. It leverages synthetic instructions and existing multilingual models to achieve near-state-of-the-art performance without extensive Basque data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large instruction datasets for low-resource languages by exploring efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Uses target language corpora, synthetic instructions, and multilingual base/instructed models (e.g., Llama 3.1 instruct 70B) for adaptation. Evaluated via benchmarks and human preferences.

Result: Synthetic instructions and instructed backbones yield robust models, outperforming base models. Near-state-of-the-art performance achieved with minimal Basque data.

Conclusion: Target language corpora and instructed backbones are crucial. Synthetic instructions enable effective adaptation for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of user-level stance detection datasets, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky, and provide a holistic view of political stances for the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Method: A dataset of 16,044 user-target stance pairs was created using a pipeline combining advanced information retrieval and large language models, generating labels with rationales and text spans.

Result: The labeling approach achieves 81% accuracy, offering a timely, open-data resource with user-level insights.

Conclusion: PolitiSky24 fills gaps in political stance analysis by providing a comprehensive, transparent, and scalable dataset for emerging platforms.

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to the Ukrainian Hutsul dialect, using a parallel corpus and synthetic data generation to address low-resource challenges. Fine-tuned models outperform GPT-4o in translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt LLMs for the low-resource and morphologically complex Hutsul dialect, addressing data scarcity and improving translation quality.

Method: Created a parallel corpus and dictionary, used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for synthetic data, and fine-tuned LLMs with LoRA. Evaluated using BLEU, chrF++, TER, and GPT-4o judgments.

Result: Fine-tuned small (7B) models outperformed zero-shot GPT-4o in translation tasks across all metrics.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts LLMs to low-resource dialects, with publicly released data and models.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRMA, a method replacing additive updates in LoRA with multiplicative transformations for efficient fine-tuning of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of large language models is computationally expensive, and existing methods like LoRA use additive updates, which may not be optimal.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), addressing computational complexity and rank bottlenecks through operation re-ordering and rank inflation strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show LoRMA's effectiveness across various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: LoRMA offers a more efficient and effective alternative to additive update methods like LoRA for fine-tuning large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-grained annotation of teacher intents improves LLM-generated tutoring responses, enhancing pedagogical alignment and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack alignment with pedagogical strategies, limiting their effectiveness in educational applications like intelligent tutoring systems.

Method: Re-annotated a portion of the MathDial dataset using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents, then fine-tuned an LLM with these annotations.

Result: The fine-grained model outperformed models trained on the original four-category taxonomy, producing more pedagogically aligned and effective responses.

Conclusion: Fine-grained intent annotation enhances LLM performance in educational settings, and the annotated data and code are released for further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: DOCCI-Critique is a benchmark for evaluating factual accuracy in VLM-generated captions, featuring human annotations and automated tools like VNLI-Critique for factuality classification and critique generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating VLM-generated captions lack fine-grained error detection and verified datasets, necessitating a more robust benchmark and tools.

Method: Developed DOCCI-Critique with human-annotated captions and VNLI-Critique for automated factuality classification and critique generation.

Result: VNLI-Critique shows strong performance on benchmarks, reliable VLM rankings, and improves caption factuality via a Critic-and-Revise pipeline.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark and tools to enhance fine-grained evaluation and VLM image understanding.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

*Yuan Chang,Ziyue Li,Hengyuan Zhang,Yuanbo Kong,Yanru Wu,Zhijiang Guo,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TreeReview is a hierarchical, bidirectional QA framework for generating thorough and efficient peer reviews using LLMs, outperforming baselines in quality and reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based peer review methods lack thoroughness and efficiency. TreeReview aims to improve both by modeling reviews as a hierarchical QA process.

Method: TreeReview constructs a tree of review questions, decomposes high-level questions into sub-questions, and aggregates answers dynamically. It includes a question expansion mechanism for deeper probing.

Result: TreeReview outperforms baselines in generating comprehensive and expert-aligned reviews, reducing LLM token usage by up to 80%.

Conclusion: TreeReview offers a scalable and efficient solution for high-quality peer review generation, with potential applications in academic and professional settings.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are
available at https://github.com/YuanChang98/tree-review.

*Maciej Chrabąszcz,Katarzyna Lorenc,Karolina Seweryn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to cheap, character/word-level attacks in low-resource languages like Polish, bypassing safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLM susceptibility to perturbations, especially in low-resource languages, due to limited safety training data.

Method: Use small proxy models to calculate word importance and alter few characters for attack construction.

Result: Attacks drastically alter LLM predictions, revealing vulnerabilities in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: LLMs need improved safety evaluations for low-resource languages; datasets and code are released for further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a method for phonemic and prosodic labeling in Japanese TTS datasets using a fine-tuned ASR model and dictionary-based error correction, outperforming text/audio-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the construction of Japanese TTS datasets by automating phonemic and prosodic labeling, reducing reliance on manual annotations.

Method: Fine-tunes a pre-trained ASR model to output graphemes and labels, using dictionary priors for error correction.

Result: Outperforms text/audio-only methods in objective evaluation; TTS models trained with these labels match manual annotation quality in subjective tests.

Conclusion: The method effectively automates labeling for TTS datasets, achieving results comparable to manual annotations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

*Nitin Sharma,Thomas Wolfers,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deterministic pipeline for creating domain-specific benchmarks for language model evaluation, revealing insights into domain adaptation and knowledge representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in reliable domain-specific LM evaluation and understanding knowledge representation during domain adaptation.

Method: A deterministic pipeline converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks using TF and Term TF-IDF methods, generating prompt-target pairs for evaluation.

Result: The benchmark correlates with expert-generated ones and provides a more accurate domain knowledge measure than perplexity metrics. Domain adaptation occurs rapidly in smaller models, and mechanistic analysis reveals layer-specific roles and forgetting patterns.

Conclusion: The work offers a practical evaluation methodology and insights into domain adaptation, aiding efficient fine-tuning and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve LLM mathematical reasoning by extracting structural information and generating problem-solving code, creating a high-quality dataset and benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for enhancing LLM reasoning suffer from poor generation quality and struggle with complex problems.

Method: Extract structural information and generate problem-solving code to guide data generation, producing labeled datasets.

Result: Created 39K problems with intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark; model performance declines with longer reasoning.

Conclusion: The method and dataset effectively enhance LLM reasoning, validated by fine-tuning experiments, and contribute to future research.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An audit of Twitch's AutoMod reveals it misses up to 94% of hateful content but blocks 89.5% of benign examples, highlighting its reliance on slurs and lack of contextual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of Twitch's AutoMod in flagging hateful content, given the growing reliance on automated moderation for real-time engagement.

Method: Created streaming accounts to test AutoMod, sent 107,000 comments from 4 datasets via Twitch's APIs, and measured accuracy in flagging hateful content (misogyny, racism, ableism, homophobia).

Result: AutoMod misses up to 94% of hateful content but blocks 89.5% of benign examples. It relies heavily on slurs for moderation, lacking contextual understanding.

Conclusion: AutoMod has significant gaps in effectiveness, emphasizing the need for better contextual understanding in automated moderation systems.

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

*Ionut-Teodor Sorodoc,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Rexhina Blloshmi,Christopher Davis,Adrià de Gispert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GaRAGe is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to ground answers in relevant passages or deflect when information is insufficient, revealing current models' shortcomings in these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' grounding and deflection capabilities in RAG systems, reflecting real-world use cases.

Method: The benchmark includes 2366 diverse questions and 35K annotated passages, evaluating LLMs on relevance, factuality, and deflection.

Result: LLMs struggle with grounding (max 60% relevance-aware factuality) and deflection (max 31% true positive rate), especially for time-sensitive or sparse private sources.

Conclusion: GaRAGe highlights the need for improved LLM capabilities in grounding and deflection for practical RAG applications.

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAST, a training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) tailored to instruct models, improving reconstruction quality and feature interpretability compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAE training methods are designed for base models, leading to poor performance when applied to instruct models. The goal is to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes FAST, aligning SAE training with instruct models' data distribution and activation patterns.

Result: FAST outperforms baselines in reconstruction (lower MSE) and feature interpretability (higher quality features). It also discovers benefits from intervening on special tokens.

Conclusion: FAST is effective for instruct models, offering better performance and new control opportunities. Code and trained SAEs are publicly available.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

### [119] [Through the Valley: Path to Effective Long CoT Training for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07712)
*Renjie Luo,Jiaxi Li,Chen Huang,Wei Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small language models (SLMs) suffer performance degradation when trained on long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, termed Long CoT Degradation, due to error accumulation. This effect is widespread and impacts downstream tasks like RL, though mitigated by scaled supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why small language models (SLMs) perform poorly when trained on long CoT data, despite its effectiveness for larger models.

Method: Conducted experiments on Qwen2.5, LLaMA3, and Gemma3 families, analyzing performance degradation with varying CoT data sizes (8k to 220k examples).

Result: SLMs lose up to 75% performance with 8k long CoT examples, and some fail to recover even with 220k examples. Error accumulation in longer responses is the primary cause.

Conclusion: Long CoT training harms SLMs due to error accumulation, challenging assumptions about its benefits. Practical guidance is provided for improving small-scale reasoning models.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

Result: The framework is successfully applied to English, German, Czech, Korean, and Chinese, demonstrating adaptability for general and customized annotation.

Conclusion: This work enables scalable, interpretable GEC annotation and promotes consistent evaluation in multilingual settings, with tools available on GitHub.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and
evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC
annotation across languages and promotes more consistent evaluation in
multilingual settings. The complete codebase and annotation tools can be

TL;DR: The paper introduces a long-form Swiss Parliaments Corpus, using Whisper and GPT-4o for high-quality speech-text alignment, achieving a 6-point BLEU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-quality, domain-specific speech corpus for Swiss German debates by leveraging advanced ASR and LLM-based correction.

Method: Transcribes audio with Whisper Large-v3, refines with GPT-4o using official protocols, and filters segments based on BLEU and GPT-4o scores.

Result: Produced 751 hours of quality-controlled audio, showing a 6-point BLEU improvement over the original release.

Conclusion: Combining robust ASR, LLM correction, and data-driven filtering effectively enhances low-resource speech corpora.

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AbstraL, a method using reinforcement learning to enhance abstract reasoning in LLMs, mitigating performance drops from distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' lack of robustness in reasoning, especially under distribution shifts, by shifting focus from synthetic data generation to abstracting reasoning problems.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs on granular abstraction data, promoting faithful abstractions over supervised fine-tuning.

Result: AbstraL significantly reduces performance degradation on GSM perturbation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Abstracting reasoning problems via RL improves LLM robustness against distribution shifts and connects better to symbolic tools.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of Form-Dependent Bias in LLM unlearning, introduces the ORT benchmark, and proposes ROCR, a training-free method to improve unlearning robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning methods struggle with real-world efficacy due to Form-Dependent Bias, limiting their practical adoption for controlling harmful or private information.

Method: The study introduces ORT to benchmark unlearning robustness and proposes ROCR, a training-free method targeting invariants in downstream tasks to redirect harmful concepts.

Result: Results show Form-Dependent Bias is widespread and severe; ROCR outperforms traditional methods in effectiveness and output naturalness.

Conclusion: LLM unlearning should be form-independent, and ROCR offers a promising solution for real-world security-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

TL;DR: MultiMatch is a semi-supervised learning algorithm combining co-training and consistency regularization with pseudo-labeling, featuring a three-fold pseudo-label weighting module for improved performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semi-supervised learning by unifying and improving existing techniques for better robustness and performance, especially in imbalanced settings.

Method: Combines co-training and consistency regularization with pseudo-labeling, using a novel three-fold pseudo-label weighting module for selection, filtering, and weighting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 9/10 setups across 5 NLP datasets and excels in imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best method by 3.26%.

Conclusion: MultiMatch is a robust and high-performing SSL algorithm, particularly effective for imbalanced text classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

*Zhiyu Lin,Zhengda Zhou,Zhiyuan Zhao,Tianrui Wan,Yilun Ma,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebUIBench is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in web development, focusing on four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming, WebUI-HTML Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of sub-capabilities in web development, focusing only on outcomes. WebUIBench addresses this gap by systematically assessing MLLMs.

Method: The benchmark includes 21K question-answer pairs from 0.7K real-world websites, evaluating 29 MLLMs across four key areas.

Result: The evaluation reveals skill characteristics and weaknesses of MLLMs in web development.

Conclusion: WebUIBench provides a structured framework to enhance MLLMs' development efficiency by identifying and addressing their weaknesses.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and
various weakness that models encountered during the development process.

*Yiju Guo,Wenkai Yang,Zexu Sun,Ning Ding,Zhiyuan Liu,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LeaF is a two-stage framework to improve LLMs' focus on critical information by identifying and pruning confounding tokens, enhancing reasoning and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with attending to critical information due to distracting patterns and spurious correlations in training data, leading to redundant reasoning and errors.

Method: LeaF uses gradient-based comparisons to identify confounding tokens and prunes them during distillation to align attention with critical context.

Result: LeaF improves reasoning and code generation benchmarks and reduces attention to confounding tokens, yielding a more reliable model.

Conclusion: LeaF effectively mitigates spurious correlations, enhancing LLMs' focus and interpretability in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

*Ke Wang,Yiming Qin,Nikolaos Dimitriadis,Alessandro Favero,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEMOIR is a scalable framework for updating language models efficiently by using a residual memory module, minimizing interference between edits and enabling generalization to rephrased queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of updating language models post-deployment without retraining or forgetting previous knowledge motivates the need for a reliable and scalable editing method.

Method: MEMOIR uses a residual memory module with sample-dependent masks to isolate edits and sparse activation patterns to identify relevant knowledge during inference.

Result: MEMOIR outperforms existing methods in reliability, generalization, and scalability, handling thousands of edits with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: MEMOIR provides a robust solution for lifelong model editing, balancing efficiency, scalability, and performance.

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

TL;DR: MiniCPM4 is an efficient LLM for end-side devices, optimized in architecture, training data, algorithms, and inference systems, outperforming similar-sized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly efficient large language model tailored for end-side devices through systematic innovations.

Method: Innovations include InfLLM v2 for sparse attention, UltraClean and UltraChat v2 for data, ModelTunnel v2 and BitCPM for training, and CPM.cu for inference.

Result: MiniCPM4 outperforms similar-sized models, with MiniCPM4-8B showing speed improvements over Qwen3-8B in long sequences.

Conclusion: MiniCPM4 is efficient, effective, and versatile, suitable for diverse applications like survey generation and tool use.

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long
sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse
applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model
context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a hybrid quantum-classical model for structured language modeling, showing improved accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computing for more efficient and expressive machine learning models, especially in complex data domains like language understanding.

Method: QGT integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into a graph-based message-passing framework.

Result: QGT outperforms existing QNLP models, achieving 5.42% and 4.76% higher accuracy on real-world and synthetic datasets, respectively, and requires 50% fewer labeled samples.

Conclusion: Graph-based QNLP techniques, exemplified by QGT, hold promise for scalable and efficient language understanding.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

### [130] [Statistical Hypothesis Testing for Auditing Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07947)
*Paulius Rauba,Qiyao Wei,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for testing changes in LLM outputs under interventions, using semantic similarity and hypothesis testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing LLM outputs focus on bias or fairness, not changes due to interventions.

Method: Proposes distribution-based perturbation analysis, constructing empirical null and alternative distributions via Monte Carlo sampling in a low-dimensional space.

Result: The framework is model-agnostic, tractable, interpretable, and supports multiple perturbations with controlled error rates.

Conclusion: It provides a reliable frequentist hypothesis testing method for LLM auditing, demonstrated through case studies.

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

### [131] [Language Models over Canonical Byte-Pair Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07956)
*Tim Vieira,Tianyu Liu,Clemente Pasti,Yahya Emara,Brian DuSell,Benjamin LeBrun,Mario Giulianelli,Juan Luis Gastaldi,Timothy J. O'Donnell,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of noncanonical token encodings in language models, proposing two methods to enforce canonicality and improve model efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tokenization methods in language models allocate probability to noncanonical token strings, which are never seen in training data, leading to inefficiencies and errors.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: (1) canonicality by conditioning (test-time inference) and (2) canonicality by construction (model parameterization requiring training).

Result: Enforcing canonicality improves the likelihood of held-out data across various models and corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively eliminate noncanonical token encodings, enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

*Elliot Kim,Avi Garg,Kenny Peng,Nikhil Garg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether diversity in training data, architecture, and providers reduces homogeneity in LLMs, finding high error correlations among models, especially larger ones, and impacts on downstream tasks like hiring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically assess if diverse LLMs differ meaningfully, given assumptions that diversity mitigates homogeneity.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of over 350 LLMs using leaderboards and a resume-screening task, analyzing error correlations and influencing factors.

Result: High error correlation (60% agreement when both err), driven by shared architectures/providers, but also present in larger, distinct models. Downstream impacts confirmed.

Conclusion: Diversity assumptions may not hold; error correlation persists even in diverse models, affecting tasks like hiring, highlighting risks of algorithmic monoculture.

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

TL;DR: Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) reframes next-token prediction as a reasoning task using RL, improving language modeling accuracy and providing a scalable foundation for further fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage vast text data for general-purpose RL without domain-specific annotations, improving next-token prediction accuracy.

Method: RPT trains next-token prediction as a reasoning task with verifiable rewards, incentivizing accurate predictions.

Result: RPT significantly improves next-token prediction accuracy and scales well with increased training compute.

Conclusion: RPT is an effective and promising paradigm for advancing language model pre-training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vulnerability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to adversarial watermarking in dermatological image analysis, comparing it to CNNs and evaluating adversarial training as a defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of transformer-based models like ViTs in computer vision, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, especially in medical imaging, remains underexplored.

Method: Adversarial watermarks are generated using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to attack ViTs, and their transferability to CNNs is tested. Adversarial training is evaluated as a defense.

Result: ViTs show significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks (accuracy drops to 27.6%), but adversarial training improves robustness (accuracy rises to 90.0%).

Conclusion: While ViTs are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks in medical imaging, adversarial training effectively mitigates this vulnerability.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

Motivation: Existing fitness tracking models are limited in exercise variety or too complex for real-world use. This work aims to democratize AI-powered fitness tracking by addressing these gaps.

Method: Developed a robust multitask motion analysis model using a large-scale dataset (Olympia) with 1,900+ exercises. Uses a vision-language transformer for exercise detection and repetition counting.

Result: Achieves 76.5% accuracy in exercise detection and 85.3% off-by-one accuracy in repetition counting using RGB video.

Conclusion: The system advances fitness tracking by combining exercise identification and rep counting in a single model, making AI-powered tracking more accessible.

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

TL;DR: A generalizable Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based semantic SLAM algorithm is introduced, improving 3D map resolution and semantic segmentation with efficient optimization and zero-shot transfer capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLAM lacks high-resolution 3D maps, while GS-based SLAM suffers from slow per-scene optimization and poor generalization. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: Uses a learned network to predict Gaussian parameters from RGB-D images, integrates semantic segmentation, and optimizes GS with 1 iteration post-global localization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on ScanNet, uses fewer Gaussians, and generalizes to NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently combines 3D mapping and recognition, offering high-quality, generalizable semantic SLAM.

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AVS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations, prompting the need for a cost-effective, annotation-free solution.

Method: The framework integrates audio, vision, and text representations from pretrained models to bridge modality gaps and segment sound sources.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration of pretrained models effectively enables fine-grained AVS without task-specific training or annotations.

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates DNN robustness in traffic sign recognition, proposes a data augmentation-based method to mitigate error-minimizing attacks, and introduces a detection model for poisoned data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of DNNs to data poisoning attacks in traffic sign recognition and ensure model security.

Method: Error-minimizing attacks are performed, followed by a data augmentation-based training method using nonlinear transformations. A detection model for poisoned data is also proposed.

Result: Attacks reduced accuracy from 99.90% to 10.6%, but the mitigation method restored it to 96.05%. The detection model achieved a 99% success rate.

Conclusion: Advanced training methods are essential for DNNs in traffic sign recognition to counter data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

### [140] [Textile Analysis for Recycling Automation using Transfer Learning and Zero-Shot Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06569)
*Yannis Spyridis,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using RGB imagery and deep learning for automated textile recycling, achieving high accuracy in textile classification (81.25%) and feature segmentation (mIoU 0.90).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving efficiency in textile recycling by addressing challenges in material composition identification and contaminant detection using cost-effective RGB imagery.

Method: Utilized transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., EfficientNetB0) for textile classification and a zero-shot approach (Grounding DINO + Segment Anything Model) for feature segmentation.

Result: EfficientNetB0 achieved 81.25% accuracy in classification, and the zero-shot segmentation approach achieved a mIoU of 0.90.

Conclusion: RGB imagery combined with modern deep learning techniques is feasible for automating key steps in textile recycling pipelines.

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

*Anees Nashath Shaik,Barbara Villarini,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven platform using GANs and autoencoders enhances surveillance by generating diverse synthetic training data and improving image quality, reducing bias in facial recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases and limitations in AI-based facial recognition due to low-quality images, occlusions, and lack of dataset diversity.

Method: Uses deep learning (autoencoders and GANs) for facial attribute manipulation, reconstruction, and image enhancement.

Result: Improved training data diversity and model fairness, validated on the CelebA dataset.

Conclusion: The platform reduces bias and enhances surveillance accuracy, leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EV-LayerSegNet is a self-supervised CNN for event-based motion segmentation, using affine optical flow and segmentation masks to deblur events, achieving 71% IoU and 87% detection rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground truth for event-based networks is expensive and error-prone, necessitating a self-supervised approach.

Method: Uses a layered scene representation to learn affine optical flow and segmentation masks separately, measuring deblurring quality as a self-supervised loss.

Result: Achieves 71% IoU and 87% detection rate on a simulated dataset with affine motion.

Conclusion: EV-LayerSegNet demonstrates effective self-supervised learning for event-based motion segmentation.

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

*Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RARL, a Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, to enhance medical VLMs' reasoning, efficiency, and adaptability in low-resource settings. It outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs lack generalization, transparency, and computational efficiency, limiting real-world deployment. RARL aims to address these challenges.

Method: RARL fine-tunes Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward functions for diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality. Training is done on a single GPU.

Result: RARL improves VLM performance by 7.78% in reasoning tasks and shows 27% better generalization on unseen datasets, with reduced resource usage.

Conclusion: Reasoning-guided learning and prompting enhance medical VLMs' transparency, accuracy, and efficiency, making them viable for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.
Code and data are publicly available.

### [144] [Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06602)
*Santhosh Kakarla,Gautama Shastry Bulusu Venkata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves zero-shot composed image retrieval (CIR) by fine-tuning BLIP-2 with a Q-Former, achieving significant performance gains. It also explores Retrieval-DPO but finds it ineffective due to several limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of zero-shot CIR, which underperforms on benchmarks like FashionIQ, by leveraging advanced fusion techniques and addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Fine-tunes BLIP-2 with a lightweight Q-Former for joint image-text fusion and evaluates Retrieval-DPO, a method using Direct Preference Optimization on hard negatives.

Result: BLIP-2 with Q-Former achieves Recall@10 of 45.6% (shirt), 40.1% (dress), and 50.4% (top-tee), while Retrieval-DPO fails with only 0.02% Recall@10.

Conclusion: Effective CIR requires multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and high-quality negatives, as demonstrated by the success of BLIP-2 and the failure of Retrieval-DPO.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

### [145] [PhysLab: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-Granularity Visual Parsing of Physics Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06631)
*Minghao Zou,Qingtian Zeng,Yongping Miao,Shangkun Liu,Zilong Wang,Hantao Liu,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysLab is a new video dataset for fine-grained visual parsing in educational scenarios, addressing gaps in annotation granularity, domain coverage, and procedural guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack granularity, domain coverage (especially in education), and procedural guidance, limiting progress in visual parsing.

Method: Introduces PhysLab, a dataset with 620 long-form videos of physics experiments, featuring multilevel annotations for tasks like action recognition and HOI analysis.

Result: Establishes baselines and evaluations, highlighting challenges in parsing procedural educational videos.

Conclusion: PhysLab aims to advance fine-grained visual parsing and integrate computer vision with educational technologies.

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The
dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at

### [146] [Dark Channel-Assisted Depth-from-Defocus from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06643)
*Moushumi Medhi,Rajiv Ranjan Sahay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the dark channel prior to estimate depth from a single defocused image, improving upon traditional multi-image DFD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFD techniques require multiple images, but the paper aims to solve the underconstrained problem of single-image DFD by leveraging dark channel and contrast cues.

Method: The method uses dark channel prior and contrast variations as depth cues, trained adversarially in an end-to-end pipeline.

Result: Experiments on real data show meaningful depth estimation, validating the approach.

Conclusion: Incorporating dark channel prior into single-image DFD is effective for depth estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

*Cheng Peng,Jingxiang Sun,Yushuo Chen,Zhaoqi Su,Zhuo Su,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGHM introduces a generalizable framework for fast, high-fidelity human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting and human priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in existing methods, such as time-consuming optimization and poor generalization with sparse inputs, for photorealistic and animatable human avatars.

Method: PGHM uses a UV-aligned latent identity map and a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net to predict Gaussian attributes, enabling efficient subject adaptation.

Result: PGHM achieves comparable visual quality in ~20 minutes per subject, outperforming optimization-from-scratch methods.

Conclusion: PGHM demonstrates practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar creation with efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

### [148] [Flood-DamageSense: Multimodal Mamba with Multitask Learning for Building Flood Damage Assessment using SAR Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06667)
*Yu-Hsuan Ho,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flood-DamageSense is a deep-learning model for flood-damage assessment, outperforming existing methods by 19% F1 score, especially in minor/moderate damage categories, using SAR/InSAR, optical data, and flood-risk layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to accurately identify flood-related building damages due to minimal spectral/structural signatures post-inundation.

Method: Uses a multimodal Mamba backbone with SAR/InSAR, optical basemaps, and flood-risk layers to predict damage states, floodwater extent, and footprints.

Result: Achieves 19% F1 improvement over baselines, with significant gains in minor/moderate damage categories.

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense provides faster, finer-grained flood-damage intelligence for post-disaster decision-making.

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

TL;DR: An XAI framework using CNN-LSTM for embryo classification in IVF improves accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infertility impacts quality of life, and IVF is a key solution. Current embryo grading is inefficient.

Method: Combines CNN and LSTM (CNN-LSTM) for deep learning-based embryo classification with XAI for interpretability.

Result: High accuracy in embryo classification achieved.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM model enhances IVF efficiency and interpretability in embryo selection.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Motivation: To address the lack of real-world datasets for evaluating omnidirectional super-resolution methods, which currently rely on synthetic degradation.

Method: Systematic review of deep learning-based ODISR/ODVSR methods, introduction of the 360Insta dataset, and comprehensive evaluation of existing methods.

Result: 360Insta dataset fills a critical gap, enabling robust evaluation of generalization capabilities. Existing methods are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The paper highlights current research status, future directions, and provides open access to datasets, methods, and metrics for ongoing updates.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation
metrics introduced in this work are publicly available and will be regularly

*Saiyu Hu,Chunlei He,Jianfeng Zhang,Dexing Kong,Shoujun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (HMCF-ACMs) and their dual-mode variant (HDRF-ACMs) for adaptive image segmentation, proving their equivalence to wave equations and demonstrating improved precision, noise resistance, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parabolic mean curvature flow-driven models (PMCF-ACMs) heavily depend on initial curve configurations, limiting adaptability. This work aims to overcome this by introducing tunable initial velocity fields.

Method: Proposes HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs, establishes their equivalence to wave equations using level set methods, and optimizes a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm for solving these equations.

Result: HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs achieve more precise segmentations with better noise resistance and numerical stability due to adaptive initial configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed hyperbolic models outperform traditional PMCF-ACMs by enabling task-adaptive segmentation, validated through theoretical proofs and experiments.

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are
widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the
selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose
several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce
tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse
segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

*Mufhumudzi Muthivhi,Jiahao Huo,Fredrik Gustafsson,Terence L. van Zyl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for wildlife, focusing on the Big Five African animals, to improve human-wildlife conflict mitigation. It compares parametric and non-parametric methods, showing feature-based approaches outperform traditional OOD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-wildlife conflict requires accurate identification of animals, but current models fail with unknown species. This study aims to enhance OOD detection for better conflict resolution.

Method: The study uses parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and non-parametric contrastive learning, leveraging pretrained features from classification encoders, and compares them to common OOD techniques.

Result: Feature-based methods, especially NCM with ImageNet features, outperform others, improving AUPR-IN by 2%, AUPR-OUT by 4%, and AUTC by 22%.

Conclusion: Feature-based OOD detection, particularly NCM, offers superior generalization for wildlife identification, aiding human-wildlife conflict mitigation.

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

*Zixian Gao,Chao Yang,Zhanhui Zhou,Xing Xu,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local Perception Search (LPS), a training-free decoding method to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by leveraging local visual priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce plausible but incorrect outputs (hallucinations) that don't align with image content, especially in noisy settings.

Method: LPS uses local visual prior information as a value function to correct decoding during inference, without requiring additional training.

Result: LPS significantly reduces hallucinations, especially in noisy scenarios, and is compatible with various models.

Conclusion: LPS is an effective, plug-and-play solution for mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs, particularly under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

### [156] [SAR2Struct: Extracting 3D Semantic Structural Representation of Aircraft Targets from Single-View SAR Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06757)
*Ziyu Yue,Ruixi You,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAR target structure recovery, a novel task to infer target components and their structural relationships from single-view SAR images, using a two-step framework based on structural descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR image methods focus on 3D reconstruction or local features, missing semantic structural modeling. This work aims to bridge this gap by capturing semantic information through structural relationships.

Method: A two-step framework: (1) detect 2D keypoints from real SAR images, (2) learn mapping from keypoints to 3D hierarchical structures using simulated data, integrating both steps for inference.

Result: The method successfully derives 3D semantic structural representations of aircraft targets from single-view SAR images, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively recovers target structures from SAR images, demonstrating the feasibility of semantic representation extraction directly from 2D SAR data.

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

TL;DR: LitMAS is a lightweight, generalizable multi-modal anti-spoofing framework for biometric systems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with high efficiency and edge deployment suitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric systems are vulnerable to spoofing, and existing solutions lack a unified, resource-efficient approach across multiple modalities.

Method: Proposes LitMAS with a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss to enhance inter-class separability and cross-modal consistency for robust spoof detection.

Result: LitMAS achieves a 1.36% lower average EER than state-of-the-art methods across seven datasets, using only 6M parameters.

Conclusion: LitMAS is efficient, generalizable, and suitable for edge deployment, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method using Neural Controlled Differential Equations and Savitzky-Golay paths to model rotational dynamics on SO(3), outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SO(3) extrapolation due to noisy/sparse observations, complex dynamics, and long-term forecasting needs.

Method: Uses Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by Savitzky-Golay paths to learn latent dynamics while respecting SO(3) structure.

Result: Demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities on real-world data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses SO(3) extrapolation challenges by learning general dynamics without simplifying assumptions.

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

*Mohammad Ali Rezaei,Helia Hajikazem,Saeed Khanehgir,Mahdi Javanmardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis using diffusion models, improving identity retention and content consistency without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style transfer techniques struggle with identity preservation, especially for small or distant faces.

Method: Introduces 'Mosaic Restored Content Image' and a training-free content consistency loss to enhance identity and detail retention.

Result: Outperforms baseline models in maintaining stylistic fidelity and identity integrity, especially for small or distant faces.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses identity preservation in style transfer without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

*Chao Yin,Hao Li,Kequan Yang,Jide Li,Pinpin Zhu,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RDVP-MSD is a training-free framework for Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) that combines Region-constrained Dual-stream Visual Prompting (RDVP) and Multimodal Stepwise Decomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT) to address semantic ambiguity and discrepancy, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current promptable segmentation methods for COS suffer from semantic ambiguity in text prompts and semantic discrepancy with spatial separation in visual prompts, leading to inaccurate segmentation.

Method: The proposed RDVP-MSD framework uses MSD-CoT to progressively disentangle captions for clarity and RDVP to inject spatial constraints into visual prompts, sampling foreground and background points independently.

Result: RDVP-MSD achieves state-of-the-art segmentation results on COS benchmarks with faster inference speed, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: RDVP-MSD effectively addresses the limitations of current methods for COS without requiring training, offering superior performance and practicality.

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-LSplat introduces a view-consistent hierarchical language Gaussian Splatting method for 3D open-vocabulary querying, addressing inconsistencies in 2D-based models and improving semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based models lack unified 3D representations, causing view inconsistencies and open-vocabulary challenges, hindering hierarchical semantic understanding.

Method: Hi-LSplat lifts 2D features to 3D using a hierarchical semantic tree with instance clustering and employs contrastive losses for comprehensive semantic representation.

Result: The method excels in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization, demonstrating strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets.

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat effectively addresses view inconsistency and hierarchical semantic challenges, offering superior performance in 3D language field modeling.

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

*Qi Li,Liangzhi Li,Zhouqiang Jiang,Bowen Wang,Keke Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores Visual Prompting (VP) with robust source models, confirming robustness inheritance and a trade-off with generalization. It proposes Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL) to mitigate this trade-off, showing universal benefits across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if VP inherits robustness from robust source models and address the robustness-generalization trade-off.

Method: Proposes Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL), a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy for VP.

Result: PBL ensures robustness inheritance and enhances generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: The findings are universal, and PBL effectively mitigates the trade-off in VP.

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

*Chenfei Yuan,Nanshan Jia,Hangqi Li,Peter W. Glynn,Zeyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for coupled image generation controls attention to ensure similar backgrounds while allowing flexible foreground objects via text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate multiple images with shared backgrounds but varied foreground objects, addressing the challenge of balancing background coupling and foreground flexibility.

Method: Disentangles background and entity components in cross-attention modules, using time-varying weight control parameters optimized for coupling, alignment, and quality.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in background coupling, text-to-image alignment, and visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances background consistency and foreground diversity in coupled image generation.

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in surgical scene understanding due to high variability and cross-activity interference in traditional deep learning models.

Method: Proposes EndoARSS, integrating Low-Rank Adaptation and Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters with Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention for feature enhancement.

Result: Achieves superior performance on new datasets (MTLESD, MTLEndovis, MTLEndovis-Gen), outperforming existing models in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: EndoARSS advances AI-driven endoscopic surgery, enhancing safety and efficiency through improved multi-task learning.

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

*Zelin He,Sarah Alnegheimish,Matthew Reimherr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage VLM-based method for time-series anomaly detection, outperforming existing baselines in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack visual-temporal reasoning for contextual anomalies, which VLMs can address.

Method: A two-stage approach: ViT4TS for anomaly localization and VLM4TS for refined detection using VLM reasoning.

Result: VLM4TS improves F1-max by 24.6% over baselines and is 36x more efficient in token usage.

Conclusion: VLMs can effectively enhance TSAD without time-series training, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

TL;DR: A novel method, Multi-StyleGS, is introduced for stylizing 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes with multiple artistic styles, ensuring memory efficiency and improved texture details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for stylizing 3D scenes to match artistic reference images has grown, but adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting for multi-style transfer while maintaining efficiency remains challenging.

Method: Multi-StyleGS uses bipartite matching for style-image correspondences, a semantic style loss function with segmentation, and local-global feature matching for consistency.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods in stylization quality, texture details, and color matching, while enabling flexible editing.

Conclusion: Multi-StyleGS effectively addresses the challenges of 3D GS stylization, offering memory-efficient training and superior results.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify the complex biomechanical models and analytical steps in inertial-based motion capture using Neural Networks.

Method: Comparison of Neural Network architectures and methodologies for pose estimation using low-cost and high-end MARG sensors.

Result: Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached achieved a Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96 with Mtw Awinda data.

Conclusion: Neural Networks are viable for accurate human pose estimation, comparable to fusion filters.

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

*John Waithaka,Moise Busogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LOCA, a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation, outperforming reconstruction-based methods like MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labelled training data for satellite imagery semantic segmentation and the focus of existing methods (e.g., MAE) on reconstruction rather than localisation, a key aspect of segmentation.

Method: Adapts LOCA for multimodal satellite data, extends SatMAE's channel grouping, introduces same-group attention masking, and uses relative patch position prediction for spatial reasoning.

Result: Outperforms reconstruction-based methods on the Sen1Floods11 dataset, showing better representations for segmentation.

Conclusion: Position prediction tasks, adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, are more effective for semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

Result: Outperforms encoder-decoder baselines, achieving state-of-the-art on Argoverse 2 benchmark.

Conclusion: Decoder-only models like DONUT enhance trajectory prediction performance and consistency in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

### [171] [Vision-EKIPL: External Knowledge-Infused Policy Learning for Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06856)
*Chaoyang Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-EKIPL enhances MLLMs' visual reasoning by integrating high-quality actions from external models during RL training, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for MLLMs limit reasoning capability and training efficiency by relying solely on the policy model's actions.

Method: Proposes Vision-EKIPL, an RL framework that uses external auxiliary models to guide policy optimization, expanding exploration space.

Result: Achieves up to 5% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark compared to SOTA.

Conclusion: Vision-EKIPL overcomes traditional RL limitations, boosts MLLMs' visual reasoning, and offers a new research paradigm.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

*Junyu Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Sunhong Liang,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end 3D face recognition method integrates denoising and recognition using cGAN-TOP and LDGCNN, improving accuracy by up to 14.81%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw 3D point clouds for face recognition often contain noise due to imperfect sensors, necessitating an integrated solution for denoising and recognition.

Method: Combines cGAN-TOP for denoising and LDGCNN for recognition, leveraging hierarchical local and neighboring features.

Result: Validated on Bosphorus dataset, the method improves recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Conclusion: The proposed synergistic approach effectively addresses noise in 3D face recognition, enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning framework (ViT-Mamba) for ASD diagnosis using eye-tracking data outperforms traditional methods with high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early ASD diagnosis is crucial for intervention, but expert access is limited. The study aims to improve accuracy and scalability using advanced deep learning.

Method: Combines Vision Transformers and Vision Mamba with attention-based fusion to integrate visual, speech, and facial cues, capturing spatial-temporal dynamics.

Result: Achieved 0.96 accuracy, 0.95 F1-score, 0.97 sensitivity, and 0.94 specificity on the Saliency4ASD dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The ViT-Mamba model is promising for scalable, interpretable ASD screening, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early
intervention. This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework combining
Vision Transformers (ViT) and Vision Mamba to detect ASD using eye-tracking
data. The model uses attention-based fusion to integrate visual, speech, and
facial cues, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Unlike traditional
handcrafted methods, it applies state-of-the-art deep learning and explainable
AI techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy and transparency. Tested on the
Saliency4ASD dataset, the proposed ViT-Mamba model outperformed existing
methods, achieving 0.96 accuracy, 0.95 F1-score, 0.97 sensitivity, and 0.94
specificity. These findings show the model's promise for scalable,
interpretable ASD screening, especially in resource-constrained or remote
clinical settings where access to expert diagnosis is limited.

*Reese Kneeland,Paul S. Scotti,Ghislain St-Yves,Jesse Breedlove,Kendrick Kay,Thomas Naselaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSD-Imagery is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating fMRI-to-image reconstruction models on mental imagery, showing performance differences from seen images and highlighting the importance of architectural choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating fMRI-to-image models on mental imagery, which is critical for real-world applications like brain-computer interfaces.

Method: The study benchmarks existing NSD-trained models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et al.) on NSD-Imagery to assess their performance on mental image reconstruction.

Result: Performance on mental images is largely decoupled from seen images, with simpler linear and multimodal models generalizing better than complex architectures.

Conclusion: Mental imagery datasets like NSD-Imagery are essential for practical applications, and simpler architectures may be more effective for cross-decoding tasks.

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

*Nima Jamali,Matina Mahdizadeh Sani,Hanieh Naderi,Shohreh Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KNN-Defense, a lightweight method leveraging semantic similarity in feature space, improves robustness of 3D point cloud classifiers against adversarial attacks like point dropping, shifting, and adding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud analysis are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, compromising reliability. Existing defenses often fail, necessitating a new approach.

Method: KNN-Defense uses manifold assumption and nearest-neighbor search in feature space to restore perturbed inputs, avoiding surface reconstruction or uniform point distribution enforcement.

Result: On ModelNet40, KNN-Defense boosts accuracy under point-dropping attacks by 20.1% (PointNet), 3.6% (PointNet++), 3.44% (DGCNN), and 7.74% (PCT).

Conclusion: KNN-Defense is scalable, effective, and computationally efficient, enhancing adversarial resilience for real-time 3D point cloud applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at
https://github.com/nimajam41/3d-knn-defense).

*Vladimir Yugay,Thies Kersten,Luca Carlone,Theo Gevers,Martin R. Oswald,Lukas Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaME, a dynamic scene adaptation system for 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing long-term scene evolution and maintaining consistency through keyframe management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems excel in static scenes but struggle with long-term dynamics (scene changes out of view). This work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Proposes a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism for continuous 3D updates and a keyframe management system to discard outdated observations while preserving information.

Result: GaME outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GaME effectively handles evolving scenes, improving dynamic scene representation and consistency.

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

*Olivier Papillon,Rafik Goubran,James Green,Julien Larivière-Chartier,Caitlin Higginson,Frank Knoefel,Rébecca Robillard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel sleep stage classification method using multimodal data (EOG and PSM) with ImageBind, achieving high accuracy and adaptability, even outperforming traditional EEG-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PSG with EEG is complex and unsuitable for home-based monitoring. The study explores less obtrusive alternatives (EOG and PSM) for accurate sleep stage classification.

Method: Leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals. Evaluated on 85 nights of patient recordings.

Result: Fine-tuning ImageBind improves accuracy, outperforming single-channel EOG, PSM-only, and other multimodal models. Strong performance even without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Pre-trained multimodal models like ImageBind can be effectively adapted for sleep staging, offering accuracy comparable to EEG-based systems with simpler data.

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

*Carl Brander,Giovanni Cioffi,Nico Messikommer,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel event-based OCR method for smart glasses uses eye gaze to reduce bandwidth by 98% and outperforms traditional OCR in low-light and high-speed scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB cameras on smart glasses fail in low-light and high-speed motion due to blur and limited dynamic range, and they consume excessive bandwidth and power.

Method: The approach foveates the event stream using user eye gaze, employs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data, and uses multimodal LLMs for OCR.

Result: The method reads text in low-light conditions, reduces bandwidth by 98%, and uses 2400x less bandwidth than RGB cameras.

Conclusion: The proposed event-based OCR is efficient and effective for smart glasses in challenging environments.

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

*George Lydakis,Alexander Hermans,Ali Athar,Daan de Geus,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video LLMs trained on images show strong temporal reasoning, outperforming expectations, while video-specific training offers minimal gains. A simple image-based finetuning method matches or exceeds video-trained models, suggesting inefficiencies in current video training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the temporal reasoning capabilities of Video LLMs and evaluate the impact of image-only versus video-specific training.

Method: Initialized pretrained text-only LLMs, finetuned on image- and video-caption datasets. Introduced a simple finetuning scheme using annotated image sequences and temporal questions.

Result: Image-trained LLMs performed well on temporal reasoning benchmarks, with video-trained models showing only slight improvements. The simple finetuning method matched or surpassed video-trained performance.

Conclusion: Current video training schemes may inefficiently utilize temporal features. Further research is needed to understand image-trained LLMs' temporal reasoning and improve video training efficiency.

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHiM, a novel SSM architecture for polar-coordinate streaming LiDAR, outperforms existing methods by 10% in accuracy and matches full-scan baselines at higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and misalignment of conventional methods in processing LiDAR data for autonomous vehicles, which rely on translation-invariant convolutions and are memory-intensive.

Method: PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial encoding and a global forward Mamba for temporal modeling, replacing convolutions with distortion-aware operations.

Result: PHiM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Dataset, improving accuracy by 10% and doubling throughput compared to full-scan baselines.

Conclusion: PHiM is an efficient and accurate solution for streaming LiDAR processing, suitable for real-time autonomous vehicle perception.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTtE-Flow is a novel multimodal model unifying image understanding and generation efficiently, improving speed and performance over existing unified models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified models require extensive pretraining, underperform task-specific models, and have slow image generation speeds, limiting practical use.

Method: LaTtE-Flow uses a Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based Transformer, leveraging pretrained VLMs and a flow-based architecture for efficient generation, with specialized layer groups for timesteps and a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism.

Result: LaTtE-Flow achieves strong multimodal understanding and competitive image generation with 6x faster inference speed.

Conclusion: LaTtE-Flow addresses efficiency and performance gaps in unified multimodal models, enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task learning framework for single-image super-resolution, optimized for OCR tasks, improves text detection and image fidelity in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure of deep learning-based super-resolution methods to generalize to real-world settings with complex degradations and semantic variability.

Method: Proposes a task-driven, multi-task learning framework with auxiliary loss functions (text detection, recognition, keypoints localization, hue consistency) and dynamic weight averaging. Validated on SRResNet.

Result: Improves text detection (measured with IoU) and preserves image fidelity on simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization bridges the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment in super-resolution models.

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: AR-RAG enhances image generation by dynamically retrieving and incorporating patch-level references during each generation step, avoiding issues like over-copying. It introduces two frameworks: DAiD (training-free) and FAiD (fine-tuning), showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of static retrieval methods in image generation (e.g., over-copying, stylistic bias) by enabling dynamic, context-aware retrievals.

Method: Proposes AR-RAG with two frameworks: DAiD (merges predicted and retrieved patch distributions) and FAiD (fine-tunes features of retrieved patches).

Result: Validated on benchmarks (Midjourney-30K, GenEval, DPG-Bench), showing superior performance over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: AR-RAG offers a flexible and effective approach for improving image generation through dynamic retrieval augmentation.

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

*Siyuan Jing,Guangxue Wang,Haoyang Zhai,Qin Tao,Jun Yang,Bing Wang,Peng Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NationalCSL-DP, a dual-view dataset for isolated sign language recognition (ISLR), addressing gaps in existing datasets and proposing a CNN transformer network with a fusion strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISLR datasets lack full vocabulary coverage and single-view limitations hinder real-world application due to hand occlusions.

Method: A dual-view dataset (NationalCSL-DP) with 134140 sign videos from two vertical views (front and left) is created. A CNN transformer network and fusion strategy are proposed.

Result: The fusion strategy improves ISLR performance, but sequence-to-sequence models struggle to learn complementary features from dual-view videos.

Conclusion: NationalCSL-DP fills dataset gaps and the proposed baseline is effective, though challenges remain in feature fusion for dual-view learning.

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

### [185] [Guiding Cross-Modal Representations with MLLM Priors via Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06970)
*Pengfei Zhao,Rongbo Luan,Wei Zhang,Peng Wu,Sifeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces a reinforcement learning framework for fine-grained cross-modal alignment using MLLMs, outperforming existing methods in retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the modality gap in CLIP and leverage MLLMs' inherent alignment properties for better cross-modal representation learning.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with automatic preference data construction and a Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval.

Conclusion: MAPLE effectively bridges the modality gap and enhances semantic alignment in cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and textured meshes improves efficiency in rendering complex indoor scenes by reducing Gaussian primitives while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex textures in 3DGS require excessive Gaussians, slowing rendering. A hybrid approach aims to balance efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Uses textured meshes for flat, texture-rich areas and 3DGS for complex geometries. Includes mesh pruning, joint optimization, warm-up strategy, and transmittance-aware supervision.

Result: Achieves comparable rendering quality with fewer Gaussians and higher FPS.

Conclusion: The hybrid representation effectively addresses inefficiencies in 3DGS for complex scenes, enhancing rendering speed without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

### [187] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Commonality-Oriented Gradient Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06992)
*Yanting Gao,Yepeng Liu,Junming Liu,Qi Zhang,Hongyun Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes COGO, a method to improve adversarial example transferability in Vision Transformers (ViTs) by enhancing shared features and suppressing individual model characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial examples from surrogate models often transfer poorly due to overfitting. Existing methods don't fully exploit shared features among models.

Method: COGO includes Commonality Enhancement (CE) for mid-to-low frequency perturbations and Individuality Suppression (IS) for adaptive gradient weighting.

Result: COGO significantly boosts transfer success rates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: COGO effectively improves adversarial transferability by focusing on shared model features and suppressing individuality.

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance smartphone photography by super-resolving wide-angle images using telephoto references, overcoming domain gaps and improving detail transfer.

Method: Uses Domain Modulation for global representation learning and Multi-scale Matching for accurate high-frequency detail transfer, plus Key Pruning for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DM$^3$Net effectively bridges domain gaps and improves super-resolution performance with efficient computational usage.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as
a reference. In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera
super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching.
To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

### [190] [BePo: Leveraging Birds Eye View and Sparse Points for Efficient and Accurate 3D Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07002)
*Yunxiao Shi,Hong Cai,Jisoo Jeong,Yinhao Zhu,Shizhong Han,Amin Ansari,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BePo combines BEV and sparse points representations for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, addressing limitations of each method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (BEV or sparse points) have trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving.

Method: Dual-branch design: a sparse points branch and a BEV branch, with cross-attention for information sharing and fusion.

Result: BePo outperforms on Occ3D benchmarks and maintains competitive inference speed.

Conclusion: BePo effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

TL;DR: UNO is a unified monocular visual odometry framework for robust pose estimation across diverse environments and motion patterns, using a Mixture-of-Experts strategy and differentiable Gumbel-Softmax module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods require deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, limiting adaptability. UNO aims to generalize across varied scenarios like autonomous vehicles, drones, and handheld devices.

Method: UNO employs a Mixture-of-Experts strategy with specialized decoders for different motion patterns, a Gumbel-Softmax module for expert selection, and a unified back-end combining depth priors with lightweight bundling adjustment.

Result: UNO achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI, EuRoC-MAV, and TUM-RGBD benchmarks.

Conclusion: UNO offers a robust, adaptable solution for monocular visual odometry, outperforming traditional methods in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that
enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments,
platforms, and motion patterns. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including
autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To
this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class
of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable
Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV
(indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AV-HaystacksQA, a novel task for multi-video retrieval and reasoning, along with the AVHaystacks benchmark and MAGNET framework, achieving significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for video question answering are limited, failing to address large-scale audio-visual retrieval and reasoning challenges in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose AV-HaystacksQA, a task involving salient segment identification across videos, and introduce AVHaystacks, a benchmark with 3100 QA pairs. They also present MAGNET, a multi-agent framework for this task.

Result: MAGNET achieves 89% and 65% relative improvements on BLEU@4 and GPT scores, respectively, and introduces new metrics (STEM and MTGS) for evaluation.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in large-scale audio-visual reasoning, offering a robust benchmark and framework for future research.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a
ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and
interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance. Project:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve AI-generated image detection using fine-tuned Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with human-aligned reasoning and visual-textual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for interpretable and robust detection methods for AI-generated images is growing, but existing approaches lack human-understandable justifications and suffer from hallucination.

Method: The authors construct a dataset of AI-generated images with annotations for synthesis artifacts and fine-tune MLLMs using a multi-stage optimization strategy to balance detection, localization, and explanation.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperforms baselines in detecting AI-generated images and localizing visual flaws.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between detection accuracy and human-aligned reasoning, enhancing interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRE-Net, a two-stage pipeline for accurate infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrieval, outperforming existing methods like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving infrared-based precipitation retrieval accuracy, which is currently limited by weak relations with surface precipitation, while expanding coverage beyond scanning swaths.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) Swath-Distilling with PRE-Net using Coordinated Masking and Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE) to transfer knowledge, and (2) Full-Disc Adaptation with Self-MaskTune to refine predictions.

Result: PRE-Net significantly advances precipitation retrieval performance, surpassing leading products in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrieval, addressing limitations of current technologies.

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

Conclusion: LSSKD enhances model generalization and performance efficiently, suitable for low-resource environments and multimodal applications.

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory
data under weak supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks by overcoming limitations in existing methods.

Method: Proposes D2R Loss (dual regularization) and CAG (collaborative adversarial generation) for adversarial training.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, WideResNet34-10, and PreActResNet18 show improved robustness.

Conclusion: D2R Loss with CAG effectively produces highly robust models.

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

TL;DR: Proposes UCOD-DPL, a teacher-student framework with dynamic pseudo-label learning for unsupervised camouflaged object detection, addressing noise in pseudo-labels and decoder limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCOD methods suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and simple decoders, leading to poor performance compared to supervised methods.

Method: Introduces UCOD-DPL with Adaptive Pseudo-label Module, Dual-Branch Adversarial decoder, and Look-Twice mechanism to improve pseudo-label quality and feature learning.

Result: Outperforms existing UCOD methods and even some fully-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: UCOD-DPL effectively addresses key challenges in unsupervised camouflaged object detection, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for indoor scene synthesis face issues like rigid editing, physical incoherence, and limited scalability. SceneLCM aims to overcome these with modular pipelines.

Method: SceneLCM uses four pipelines: LLM-guided layout generation, LCM-based furniture generation, environment optimization with multiresolution texture, and physical editing via simulation.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating high-quality, coherent, and physically realistic scene generation.

Conclusion: SceneLCM offers a scalable, efficient solution for interactive indoor scene synthesis with broad application potential.

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

### [201] [EdgeSpotter: Multi-Scale Dense Text Spotting for Industrial Panel Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07112)
*Changhong Fu,Hua Lin,Haobo Zuo,Liangliang Yao,Liguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EdgeSpotter, a multi-scale dense text spotter for industrial panels, addressing challenges like cross-scale localization and dense text regions. Uses a Transformer with efficient mixer and feature sampling with Catmull-Rom splines. Validated on a new benchmark dataset (IPM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in industrial panel text spotting include cross-scale localization and dense text regions. Existing methods lack multi-scale feature exploration.

Method: Develops a Transformer with efficient mixer for multi-level feature interdependencies and Catmull-Rom splines for feature sampling. Introduces the IPM dataset.

Result: Superior performance on the IPM benchmark, with practical validation on an edge AI-based vision system.

Conclusion: EdgeSpotter effectively addresses industrial panel text spotting challenges, validated by benchmarks and practical tests.

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available
at https://github.com/vision4robotics/EdgeSpotter.

Abstract: Industry partners provided a problem statement that involves classifying
electronic waste using machine learning models that will be used by
pick-and-place robots for waste segregation. We started by taking common
electronic waste items, such as a mouse and charger, unsoldering them, and
taking pictures to create a custom dataset. Then state-of-the art YOLOv11 model
was trained and run to achieve 70 mAP in real-time. Mask-RCNN model was also
trained and achieved 41 mAP. The model will be further integrated with
pick-and-place robots to perform segregation of e-waste.

*Huaize Liu,Wenzhang Sun,Qiyuan Zhang,Donglin Di,Biao Gong,Hao Li,Chen Wei,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-VAE is a hierarchical video autoencoder that efficiently models spatio-temporal redundancies, achieving high compression (1428×) while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video autoencoders inefficiently model dynamics, leading to high training costs and suboptimal compression.

Method: Hi-VAE hierarchically encodes global and detailed motion, using self-supervised encoders and a conditional diffusion decoder.

Result: Hi-VAE achieves 1428× compression (30× better than baselines) with high reconstruction quality and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Hi-VAE offers efficient, interpretable, and scalable video representation, advancing video generation research.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

*Hao Tang,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spatial Token Fusion (STF) and Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) to reduce vision token sequences in LMMs, improving efficiency without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiency in LMMs due to high LLM costs and quadratic complexity of long vision token sequences.

Method: Introduces STF to fuse spatial-adjacent tokens and MBTF to add multi-granularity features, balancing token reduction and information preservation.

Result: Achieves comparable/superior performance on 8 benchmarks with only 25% of baseline tokens.

Conclusion: STF and MBTF enhance inference efficiency while maintaining multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The

### [205] [GoTrack: Generic 6DoF Object Pose Refinement and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07155)
*Van Nguyen Nguyen,Christian Forster,Sindi Shkodrani,Vincent Lepetit,Bugra Tekin,Cem Keskin,Tomas Hodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoTrack is a CAD-based method for 6DoF object pose refinement and tracking, integrating model-to-frame and frame-to-frame registration via optical flow, achieving state-of-the-art results without object-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tracking methods rely heavily on analysis-by-synthesis for model-to-frame registration, lacking efficiency and stability. GoTrack aims to address this by combining both registration types.

Method: GoTrack uses optical flow for model-to-frame (simplified with a transformer on DINOv2) and frame-to-frame (light off-the-shelf model) registration, avoiding object-specific training.

Result: GoTrack achieves state-of-the-art RGB-only results on 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking benchmarks.

Conclusion: GoTrack offers an efficient, accurate, and minimal pipeline for 6DoF tracking, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source
code and trained models are publicly available at

*Qiong Chang,Xinyuan Chen,Xiang Li,Weimin Wang,Jun Miyazaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two GPU-optimized methods to speed up Oriented FAST feature detection in SLAM systems, achieving a 7.3x speedup on embedded GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ORB-based SLAM systems struggle with real-time processing on mobile platforms due to slow Oriented FAST calculations.

Method: Binary-level encoding for quick candidate point determination and separable Harris detection using GPU-specific instructions.

Result: 7.3x average speedup on Jetson TX2 compared to OpenCV with GPU support.

Conclusion: The methods enable real-time SLAM on mobile and resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frame Guidance is a training-free method for controllable video generation using frame-level signals, reducing memory usage and ensuring coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on fine-tuning large models, which is impractical as models grow. Frame Guidance offers a scalable alternative.

Method: Uses frame-level signals (e.g., keyframes, style images) with latent processing and optimization for coherent video generation.

Result: Produces high-quality controlled videos for tasks like keyframe guidance, stylization, and looping without training.

Conclusion: Frame Guidance is a versatile, training-free solution compatible with any video model.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical, decoupled post-training framework improves interpretability and training flexibility for pretrained neural networks in autonomous driving by reconstructing feature maps and introducing surrogate signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the interpretability and safety challenges of black-box models in end-to-end autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes feature-level reverse computation as optimization problems (linear equations or least squares) to enable independent training of components.

Result: Achieves superior generalization and computational efficiency on image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method offers a novel, efficient training paradigm with interpretable insights, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

*Mengya Xu,Zhongzhen Huang,Dillan Imans,Yiru Ye,Xiaofan Zhang,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAP-Bench, a dataset for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in surgical action planning, highlighting gaps in current benchmarks and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate MLLMs for surgical action planning, a life-critical task requiring precision and verifiability.

Method: SAP-Bench is created with 1,226 clinically validated action clips from cholecystectomy procedures. The MLLM-SAP framework leverages MLLMs for next-action recommendations.

Result: Evaluation of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant gaps in next-action prediction performance.

Conclusion: SAP-Bench addresses the need for better evaluation tools in surgical action planning, exposing limitations in current MLLMs.

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TV-LiVE is a training-free, text-guided video editing framework that enables complex tasks like object addition and non-rigid transformations by leveraging vital layers in video generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for more accessible and controllable video editing, especially for complex tasks like adding novel objects and non-rigid transformations, is unmet by current methods.

Method: TV-LiVE identifies vital layers in video generation models, linked to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), and selectively injects key/value features for editing. For object addition, it extracts masks from prominent layers.

Result: TV-LiVE outperforms existing methods in object addition and non-rigid video editing, with extracted masks accurately indicating editable regions.

Conclusion: TV-LiVE advances video editing by addressing complex tasks without training, leveraging layer vitality for high-quality results.

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

*Zhiyuan Zhong,Zhen Sun,Yepang Liu,Xinlei He,Guanhong Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadSem introduces a cross-modal backdoor attack exploiting semantic mismatches in VLMs, achieving high attack success while evading defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior backdoor attacks on VLMs focus on single-modality triggers, neglecting cross-modal vulnerabilities. This work explores semantic mismatches as triggers.

Method: BadSem poisons training data by misaligning image-text pairs, using the SIMBad dataset for semantic manipulation (color/object attributes).

Result: BadSem achieves >98% ASR, generalizes to out-of-distribution data, and transfers across modalities. Defenses like prompt and fine-tuning fail.

Conclusion: Semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs are critical; BadSem exposes urgent risks, calling for safer deployment strategies.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data augmentation framework for skeleton-based datasets, integrating geometric and intensity-based transformations to enhance dataset diversity and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limited dataset diversity and challenges like viewpoint bias and occlusions in skeleton-based datasets.

Method: Proposes a framework combining geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming, brightness, and contrast adjustments, generating three augmented versions per sample.

Result: Significantly improves model generalization and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets (DHG14/28, SHREC'17, JHMDB) with three models (e2eET, FPPR-PCD, DD-Net).

Conclusion: The framework is effective and scalable, advancing hand gesture and action recognition in real-world applications.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a controlled data generation pipeline to create the Micro Edit Dataset (MED) for improving fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs, alongside a supervised fine-tuning framework with a feature-level consistency loss. The method outperforms baselines like GPT-4o in detecting subtle visual differences and reduces hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual differences, leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts, due to limitations in training data and learning objectives.

Method: A controlled data generation pipeline produces minimally edited image pairs with aligned captions (MED dataset). A supervised fine-tuning framework with a feature-level consistency loss is introduced.

Result: The method improves difference detection accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and shows gains on standard vision-language tasks like image captioning and VQA.

Conclusion: Targeted data and alignment objectives effectively enhance fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic inference framework for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve iterative, verifier-guided visual reasoning, outperforming static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs use static visual token encoding, limiting adaptability and refinement during inference, unlike human perception.

Method: Proposes a Markov Decision Process framework with a reasoner and verifier trained via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), supported by a new dataset (VTS).

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in visual reasoning benchmarks, offering better accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: Dynamic inference mechanisms enhance fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) are repurposed for diverse tasks using few-shot fine-tuning, demonstrating adaptability beyond video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore VDMs' internalized structured representations and implicit understanding of the visual world, leveraging their training dynamics.

Method: A few-shot fine-tuning framework transforms tasks into visual transitions, training LoRA weights on short sequences without modifying the frozen VDM.

Result: Strong generalization across tasks, from low-level vision (e.g., segmentation) to high-level reasoning (e.g., ARC-AGI).

Conclusion: VDMs are adaptable visual learners, potentially serving as backbone for future vision foundation models.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multistep optimization strategy for diffusion models, improving image restoration quality and generalization, validated on real-time applications like drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models like MPGD use only one gradient update per denoising step, limiting fidelity and robustness, especially in challenging settings.

Method: A multistep optimization strategy is applied within each denoising timestep to enhance image quality and perceptual accuracy.

Result: Experiments show improved LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead, and MPGD generalizes well to natural and aerial scenes.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such
as drones and mobile robots.

*Kavitha Viswanathan,Vrinda Goel,Shlesh Gholap,Devayan Ghosh,Madhav Gupta,Dhruvi Ganatra,Sanket Potdar,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FANVID is a video-based benchmark for temporal recognition of low-resolution faces and license plates, featuring 1,463 clips with distractor elements. It defines two tasks: face matching and license plate recognition, with baseline scores of 0.58 and 0.42, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of recognizing faces and license plates in low-resolution surveillance footage by leveraging temporal information.

Method: The dataset includes manually labeled LR clips with distractor elements, downsampled from high-resolution sources. Tasks involve face matching and plate recognition, evaluated using adapted metrics.

Result: Baseline performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate recognition) demonstrate feasibility but highlight the challenge.

Conclusion: FANVID aims to advance temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable
in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To
advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AllTracker is a model for estimating long-range, high-resolution, dense point tracks in videos by predicting flow fields between frames, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point tracking methods lack high-resolution, dense correspondence fields, while optical flow methods are limited to short-range frame pairs. AllTracker bridges this gap.

Method: The model uses iterative inference on low-resolution grids with 2D convolutions for spatial propagation and pixel-aligned attention for temporal propagation, combining optical flow and point tracking techniques.

Result: AllTracker achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at high resolution (768x1024 pixels) with 16M parameters, trained on diverse datasets for optimal performance.

Conclusion: The model's design and training on varied datasets are key to its success, with detailed ablation studies provided. Code and weights are publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by
way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of
a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers
high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,
making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques saliency methods for lacking class sensitivity, introduces a diagnostic test, and proposes CASE, a contrastive method for more reliable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of saliency methods in distinguishing between class labels, despite their visual plausibility.

Method: Proposes a diagnostic test for class sensitivity and introduces CASE, a contrastive explanation method.

Result: Many saliency methods fail to distinguish class labels; CASE outperforms them in fidelity and class specificity.

Conclusion: CASE provides more faithful and class-specific explanations, highlighting structural flaws in existing saliency methods.

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

### [220] [Hierarchical Scoring with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Instance Image-Goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07338)
*Yijie Deng,Shuaihang Yuan,Geeta Chandra Raju Bethala,Anthony Tzes,Yu-Shen Liu,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) introduces hierarchical scoring to optimize viewpoint selection, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IIN methods rely on random viewpoint sampling, causing redundancy and inefficiency. A principled approach is needed to enhance performance.

Method: The framework combines cross-level semantic scoring (using CLIP-derived relevancy fields) and fine-grained local geometric scoring for precise pose estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and demonstrates real-world applicability.

Conclusion: The hierarchical scoring paradigm significantly improves efficiency and accuracy in IIN tasks.

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world
applicability.

*Satvik Praveen,Yoonsung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO integrates Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) and CBAM into YOLO for better object detection in agriculture, outperforming STN-YOLO with improved precision and reduced false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of YOLO and STNs in handling occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise in precision agriculture.

Method: Combines TPS for non-rigid transformations and CBAM for noise suppression and feature emphasis.

Result: Achieves higher precision, recall, and mAP on the PGP dataset, with a 12% reduction in false positives.

Conclusion: The model enhances spatial flexibility and attention, supporting real-time edge deployment for smart farming.

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

*Chengchao Shen,Dawei Liu,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), a method to improve unsupervised representation for multi-object images by stitching single-object images, outperforming existing contrastive learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods perform poorly on multi-object images, limiting their applicability in tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation.

Method: MOS constructs multi-object images by stitching single-object ones, leveraging predetermined object correspondences without human annotations.

Result: MOS achieves leading unsupervised representation performance on ImageNet, CIFAR, and COCO datasets for both single and multi-object images.

Conclusion: MOS provides detailed object representations for complex tasks, advancing unsupervised learning for multi-object scenarios.

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

*Jiaying He,Yitong Lin,Jiahe Chen,Honghui Xu,Jianwei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3S3 is a semi-supervised medical image segmentation model that improves boundary delineation and precision using complementary competition and contrastive selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of insufficient annotated samples and poor boundary detail capture in medical image segmentation.

Method: Integrates Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning for boundary refinement and Dynamic Complementary Competition for pseudo-label generation.

Result: Achieves superior performance on MRI and CT datasets, with at least 6% improvement on 95HD and ASD metrics.

Conclusion: C3S3 significantly advances semi-supervised segmentation, particularly in boundary accuracy.

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC), a deep generative model-based approach for ultra-low bitrate face video compression, outperforming VVC. It reviews methods, benchmarks, and standardization potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance GFVC by bridging theory and standardization, addressing gaps in face video compression using deep generative models.

Method: Comprehensive survey of GFVC methods, benchmarking, creation of a GFVC-compressed video database with MOS, and development of a low-complexity system.

Result: GFVC enables high-fidelity face video at ultra-low bitrates, surpassing VVC. A standardized framework and quality metrics are proposed.

Conclusion: GFVC has strong industrial potential but faces challenges; future work includes standardization and practical deployment.

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

*Ruchit Rawal,Reza Shirkavand,Heng Huang,Gowthami Somepalli,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGUS is a benchmark for VideoLLMs to measure freeform video captioning performance, addressing hallucinations and omissions in outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs hallucinate aggressively in freeform tasks like captioning, which isn't captured by typical multiple-choice benchmarks.

Method: ARGUS compares VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions, quantifying hallucinations (incorrect statements) and omissions (missing details).

Result: The benchmark provides dual metrics: hallucination rate and omission rate, offering a comprehensive view of captioning performance.

Conclusion: ARGUS addresses a critical gap in evaluating VideoLLMs, ensuring better assessment of their freeform text generation capabilities.

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

*Xunjie He,Christina Dao Wen Lee,Meiling Wang,Chengran Yuan,Zefan Huang,Yufeng Yue,Marcelo H. Ang Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework is proposed to address limitations in existing methods, enhancing accuracy for diverse road users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on vehicle superclass, lacking solutions for multi-class scenarios, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes a detector with a GSAF module for multi-scale feature learning, a REID module to reduce IDSW errors, and a VATM module for dynamic tracking.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets in detection and tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses multi-class challenges, improving robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Domain Feature Navigator (DFN) for cross-domain few-shot segmentation, addressing domain gaps and scarce data by decoupling domain information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS), such as domain gaps and limited fine-tuning data, by leveraging adapter-based methods for domain decoupling.

Method: Introduces DFN, a structure-based decoupler, and SAM-SVN to prevent overfitting. DFN is fine-tuned on target domains while freezing the model.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU gains in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: DFN effectively decouples domain-specific information, enhancing performance in CD-FSS tasks.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MrM is a black-box membership inference attack framework for multimodal RAG systems, addressing privacy vulnerabilities by leveraging data perturbation and counterfactual attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal RAG systems risk exposing sensitive data to privacy attacks, especially in the visual modality, which is underexplored.

Method: MrM uses object-aware data perturbation, counterfact-informed mask selection, and statistical inference to leak membership information.

Result: MrM performs strongly across datasets and models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2, and resists adaptive defenses.

Conclusion: MrM effectively bridges the gap in visual modality privacy attacks, demonstrating robustness and efficacy in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compressed Feature Quality Assessment (CFQA) to evaluate semantic fidelity in compressed features, proposes a benchmark dataset, and assesses existing metrics, highlighting the need for better evaluation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient feature transmission in resource-constrained environments and the lack of metrics to quantify semantic degradation in compressed features.

Method: Creation of a benchmark dataset with original and compressed features from vision tasks, evaluation of three metrics (MSE, cosine similarity, Centered Kernel Alignment).

Result: The dataset is representative, but existing metrics fall short in capturing semantic distortion, indicating a need for refined tools.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundational resource for CFQA research, releasing the dataset and code to advance the field.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource
for the community to explore CFQA.

### [230] [DPFormer: Dynamic Prompt Transformer for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07414)
*Sheng-Kai Huang,Jiun-Feng Chang,Chun-Rong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DPFormer, a dynamic prompt transformer with prompt schemes to address catastrophic forgetting and inter-task confusion in continual learning, achieving top performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the stability-plasticity dilemma and inter-task confusion in continual learning by enabling knowledge retention and exchange.

Method: Uses prompt schemes for memorization and learning, a unified classification module with multiple losses (binary cross entropy, knowledge distillation, auxiliary), and trains end-to-end.

Result: Achieves best performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet100, and ImageNet1K under class-incremental settings.

Conclusion: DPFormer effectively addresses continual learning challenges with minimal parameter growth and high performance.

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

### [231] [FAMSeg: Fetal Femur and Cranial Ultrasound Segmentation Using Feature-Aware Attention and Mamba Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07431)
*Jie He,Minglang Chen,Minying Lu,Bocheng Liang,Junming Wei,Guiyan Peng,Jiaxi Chen,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FAMSeg, a model for fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image segmentation, using feature perception and Mamba enhancement to improve accuracy and reduce noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ultrasound segmentation is error-prone and time-consuming; existing models struggle with noise and similarity in ultrasound images, especially for small objects.

Method: Uses longitudinal and transverse independent viewpoint scanning convolution, feature perception module, and Mamba-optimized residual structure to enhance detail capture and noise suppression.

Result: FAMSeg achieved fastest loss reduction and best segmentation performance across varying image sizes and orientations.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses challenges in ultrasound segmentation, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

*Nishi Chaudhary,S M Jamil Uddin,Sathvik Sharath Chandra,Anto Ovid,Alex Albert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study compares five LLMs (Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini 2.0 Pro) for visual hazard recognition in construction, testing zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting. CoT performed best, with GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 leading. Prompt design is crucial for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on LLM performance in safety-critical visual tasks in construction, despite their potential for hazard recognition.

Method: Comparative evaluation of five LLMs using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics under zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting strategies.

Result: CoT prompting yielded the highest accuracy. GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 performed best overall. Prompt design significantly impacts LLM performance.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering is key for reliable AI-assisted hazard recognition in construction, with CoT and specific LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-o3) showing promise.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

*Wei Yao,Yunlian Sun,Chang Liu,Hongwen Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces physical mapping to improve motion generation by enforcing physical constraints, enhancing realism in multi-person scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-capture and generative models often ignore physical constraints, causing artifacts like interpenetration and sliding, especially in multi-person interactions.

Method: The proposed method uses motion imitation in a physics-based simulation to project motions into a physically valid space, with tailored loss functions (MC and MI) for multi-person scenarios.

Result: Experiments show a 3%-89% improvement in physical fidelity of generated motions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances motion quality by integrating physical constraints, particularly beneficial for multi-person interactions.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial
intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models
for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

### [234] [GLOS: Sign Language Generation with Temporally Aligned Gloss-Level Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07460)
*Taeryung Lee,Hyeongjin Nam,Gyeongsik Moon,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GLOS, a sign language generation framework using gloss-level conditioning and temporal alignment to improve lexical order and semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLG methods suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic accuracy due to sentence-level conditions, which lack temporal structure and word-level granularity.

Method: GLOS employs gloss-level conditions aligned with motion sequences and introduces a condition fusion module (TAC) for efficient semantic and temporal alignment.

Result: GLOS outperforms prior methods on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T, generating signs with correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed GLOS framework effectively addresses the limitations of sentence-level conditions, improving sign language generation quality.

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

*Jinyoung Park,Jeehye Na,Jinyoung Kim,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores GRPO for Video LLMs, identifies issues (safeguards and vanishing advantage), and proposes Reg-GRPO and difficulty-aware data augmentation to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of Video LLMs by addressing limitations of GRPO, such as reliance on safeguards and the vanishing advantage problem.

Method: Introduces Reg-GRPO, a regression-based reformulation of GRPO, and a difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy to improve training.

Result: DeepVideo-R1, trained with Reg-GRPO and data augmentation, shows significant improvements in video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address GRPO's limitations and enhance Video LLM performance.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

### [236] [Ambiguity-Restrained Text-Video Representation Learning for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07471)
*CH Cho,WJ Moon,W Jun,MS Jung,JP Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning (ARL) to address ambiguous text-video pairs in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), improving retrieval accuracy by detecting and learning from ambiguous pairs hierarchically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods assume a one-to-one text-video relationship, ignoring inherent ambiguity due to conceptual scope differences between text and video content.

Method: ARL detects ambiguous pairs using uncertainty and similarity criteria, then learns semantic relationships via multi-positive contrastive learning and dual triplet margin loss. It also explores fine-grained text-frame relationships and cross-model ambiguity detection to reduce error propagation.

Result: The proposed ARL framework effectively improves performance in PRVR by addressing ambiguity in text-video pairs.

Conclusion: ARL successfully mitigates ambiguity in PRVR, enhancing retrieval accuracy through hierarchical learning and cross-model detection.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

*Dasol Hong,Wooju Lee,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCoA-Mix, a method combining confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) and confidence-aware weights (CoA-weights) to improve specialization and generalization in prompt tuning for vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frozen encoders in prompt tuning often produce misaligned features, causing class confusion and limiting task specialization.

Method: Proposes CoA-loss to refine decision boundaries and CoA-weights in a mixture model to balance specialization and generalization.

Result: CoCoA-Mix outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing both specialization and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses misalignment and confusion in prompt tuning, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveAnyMesh is a 4D diffusion model for mesh animation from monocular video, addressing inefficiencies in current 4D generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in 4D generation like low rendering efficiency in implicit methods and manual effort in skeletal methods, while enabling animation of existing 3D assets.

Method: Uses a 4D diffusion model to denoise latent sets, decoded into mesh animations from point cloud trajectories, leveraging a transformer-based VAE for shape and motion.

Result: Produces high-quality animations efficiently, compatible with modern rendering engines.

Conclusion: DriveAnyMesh is promising for gaming and filming industries due to its efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both
the gaming and filming industries.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a feasible path to improve spatial understanding in LLMs for practical applications.

Abstract: SpatialLM is a large language model designed to process 3D point cloud data
and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs. These outputs include
architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object boxes
with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods which exploit
task-specific network designs, our model adheres to the standard multimodal LLM
architecture and is fine-tuned directly from open-source LLMs.
  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset
consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with
ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art

Result: Achieves SOTA metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611) on nuScenes, improving downstream tasks like segmentation and 3D detection.

Conclusion: Genesis validates semantic fidelity and utility of generated data, proving effective for multi-modal driving data generation.

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view
driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal
consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a
DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR
generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are
directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution
across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured
semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on
vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level
supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that
Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics

TL;DR: MoQAE is a mixed-precision quantization method for LLMs, combining quantization-aware experts and chunk-based routing to optimize KV cache memory usage while balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High memory consumption of KV cache in LLMs is a challenge. Existing quantization methods lack balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: MoQAE uses mixture of quantization-aware experts, chunk-based routing, lightweight fine-tuning, and routing freezing/sharing mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: MoQAE effectively reduces memory usage while maintaining model accuracy, offering a practical solution for long-context inference.

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Domain randomization effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, with material properties, rendering, and post-processing being key factors.

Abstract: This paper addresses key aspects of domain randomization in generating
synthetic data for manufacturing object detection applications. To this end, we
present a comprehensive data generation pipeline that reflects different
factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and
post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object
Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use
cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also
employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In
our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the
feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In
particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods,
post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging
these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models
trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics
dataset, and 94.1%, 99.5%, and 95.3% across three of the SIP15-OD use cases,
respectively. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed domain
randomization, potentially covering the distribution close to real data for the
applications.

TL;DR: The APTOS-2024 Challenge explored AI-based 3D OCT generation from 2D fundus images to address accessibility and cost issues in ophthalmic care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and specialized requirements of OCT limit its use, while 2D fundus images are more accessible. AI could bridge this gap by generating 3D OCT from 2D images.

Method: The challenge involved a benchmark dataset, evaluation metrics (pixel-level and semantic-level fidelity), and analysis of top solutions from 342 teams.

Result: Leading methods used hybrid preprocessing, external dataset pre-training, vision foundation models, and architecture improvements.

Conclusion: The challenge demonstrated the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT synthesis, potentially improving accessibility in under-resourced settings.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),

*Haoxiang Wang,Zinan Lin,Da Yu,Huishuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPTI generates high-resolution DP synthetic images by converting images to text, applying DP text generation, and reconstructing images, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP image synthesis methods fail to produce high-resolution outputs that retain original data structure.

Method: SPTI converts images to text, applies DP text generation, and reconstructs images using off-the-shelf models without training.

Result: SPTI achieves better FID scores (e.g., 26.71 vs. 40.36 on LSUN Bedroom) than prior DP methods.

Conclusion: SPTI offers a resource-efficient, high-quality solution for DP synthetic image generation.

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

*Hao Yang,JianYu Wu,Run Fang,Xuelian Zhao,Yuan Ji,Zhiyu Chen,Guibin He,Junceng Guo,Yang Liu,Xinhua Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy is proposed to address overlooked cross-channel correlations in H&E-to-IHC studies, improving virtual staining quality for pathological diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing H&E-to-IHC studies neglect cross-channel correlations between cell nuclei and membranes, limiting analysis and diagnosis accuracy.

Method: CCPL decomposes HER2 staining into nuclei and membrane channels, extracts dual-channel features using Gigapath's Tile Encoder, measures cross-channel correlations, and ensures staining consistency via statistical analysis.

Result: CCPL outperforms in metrics (PSNR, SSIM, PCC, FID) and pathologist evaluations, preserving features and enhancing virtual staining quality.

Conclusion: CCPL effectively improves virtual staining, supporting automated pathological diagnosis with high-quality multimedia medical data.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

*Jinlu Zhang,Zixi Kang,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenDance5D, a large dance dataset, and OpenDanceNet, a framework for controllable dance generation from music and multimodal inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of fine-grained multimodal data and challenges in flexible multi-conditional dance generation.

Method: Developed OpenDance5D dataset with 5 modalities and proposed OpenDanceNet, a masked modeling framework for controllable generation.

Result: OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability in dance generation.

Conclusion: The work advances dance generation by providing a robust dataset and a versatile framework.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation offers significant creative potential yet faces
considerable challenges. The absence of fine-grained multimodal data and the
difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on
generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build
OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across
14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust
cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,
keypoints, or character positioning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

*Marco Peer,Robert Sablatnig,Florian Kleber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores writer retrieval performance at line- and word-level, showing deep learning methods outperform handcrafted features in low-text scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how text quantity affects writer retrieval accuracy, moving beyond page-level analysis.

Method: Evaluated three state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems (handcrafted and deep learning-based) on CVL and IAM datasets using varying text quantities.

Result: Performance drops 20-30% with one line but stays above 90% of full-page accuracy with four lines. Deep learning (NetVLAD) outperforms handcrafted features in low-text cases.

Conclusion: Text-dependent retrieval is viable in low-text scenarios, with deep learning methods showing superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset for indoor layout generation, and OptiScene, an optimized LLM for this task, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing indoor layout generation methods, such as spatial inconsistency, high computational costs, and limited generalization.

Method: Combines synthetic data generation via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline and a two-stage training approach (SFT and DPO) for LLM optimization.

Result: OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines, showing promise in interactive tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and LLM offer improved performance and generalization for indoor layout generation, with potential applications in scene editing and robot navigation.

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

*Yu Li,Feng Xue,Shujie Li,Jinrui Zhang,Shuang Yang,Dan Guo,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFLip introduces a speaker-invariant feature learning framework for lipreading, using implicit and explicit disentanglement to improve generalization by removing speaker-specific attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lipreading methods suffer from spurious correlations due to speaker-specific features, reducing accuracy and generalization.

Method: SIFLip uses two disentanglement modules: implicit (leveraging text embeddings) and explicit (via speaker recognition and gradient reversal).

Result: SIFLip outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively disentangles speaker-specific features, improving lipreading accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Hu Zhang,Hao Fei,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-o is a model-agnostic framework for evaluating and quantifying uncertainty in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), addressing key challenges in unified evaluation, prompting, and downstream task application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of methods for evaluating and quantifying uncertainty in LMMs, despite their perceived robustness compared to pure Language Large Models (LLMs).

Method: Introduces Uncertainty-o, a framework for unified uncertainty evaluation, explores multimodal prompt perturbations, and formulates multimodal semantic uncertainty.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across 18 benchmarks and 10 LMMs, improving tasks like hallucination detection and mitigation.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o reliably estimates LMM uncertainty, enhancing downstream applications and providing insights into model robustness.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

### [251] [Super Encoding Network: Recursive Association of Multi-Modal Encoders for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07576)
*Boyu Chen,Siran Chen,Kunchang Li,Qinglin Xu,Yu Qiao,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Super Encoding Network (SEN) to enhance video understanding by enabling deeper multi-modal interactions through recursive association of encoders, outperforming existing methods in tasks like tracking, recognition, chatting, and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal foundation models lack deeper multi-modal interactions, limiting their ability to understand complex video scenes and movements.

Method: Proposes SEN, treating pre-trained encoders as 'super neurons' and using a Recursive Association (RA) block to fuse multi-modalities recursively.

Result: SEN improves performance in four video tasks, e.g., boosting tracking accuracy by 2.7% and enhancing video editing metrics by 4.1-6.4%.

Conclusion: SEN effectively addresses the gap in multi-modal interactions, advancing video understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

TL;DR: A novel security threat in diffusion models allows attackers to generate synthetic images via APIs, train substitute models, and execute adversarial attacks on black-box models with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing security and privacy risks in diffusion models, such as copyright violations, sensitive data leakage, and malicious content creation.

Method: Leveraging diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic images for training substitute models, enabling efficient adversarial attacks without original data.

Result: Achieves 27.37% average improvement over state-of-the-art methods with 0.01x query budget and 98.68% adversarial attack success rate.

Conclusion: Demonstrates significant security vulnerabilities in diffusion models, highlighting the need for robust defenses against model extraction and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneRAG improves video understanding by segmenting videos into narrative-consistent scenes using ASR transcripts and temporal metadata, outperforming baselines with a 72.5% win rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods disrupt video context by using fixed-length chunks, failing to capture authentic scene boundaries. SceneRAG addresses this by mimicking human scene organization.

Method: SceneRAG uses large language models to segment videos into coherent scenes via ASR transcripts and temporal metadata, refines boundaries with heuristics, and builds dynamic knowledge graphs for multi-hop retrieval.

Result: SceneRAG achieves a 72.5% win rate on the LongerVideos benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: SceneRAG effectively addresses the challenges of long-form video understanding by leveraging narrative-consistent segmentation and multimodal fusion.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative

systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a
unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset,
\textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}.
SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with
SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11
specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P

TL;DR: DragNeXt simplifies Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE) by redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of handle regions, addressing ambiguity and improving quality through Latent Region Optimization and Progressive Backward Self-Intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DBIE methods are ambiguous and cumbersome, relying on point-based drag and alternating motion supervision and tracking, leading to poor results.

Method: DragNeXt unifies DBIE as a Latent Region Optimization problem, solved via Progressive Backward Self-Intervention, leveraging region-level structure and intermediate drag states.

Result: DragNeXt outperforms existing methods on NextBench, demonstrating superior quality and simplicity.

Conclusion: DragNeXt offers a more effective and user-friendly approach to DBIE, resolving ambiguity and enhancing results.

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

TL;DR: The paper compares video-based and language-based virtual IMU data generation with classical augmentation for HAR, showing virtual data outperforms real or augmented data, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of labeled HAR datasets by exploring cross-modality transfer for virtual IMU data generation.

Method: Direct comparison of video-based, language-based, and classical augmentation techniques using a large-scale virtual IMU dataset and benchmark HAR datasets.

Result: Virtual IMU data significantly improves HAR performance over real or augmented data, particularly in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies, highlighting pros and cons of each approach.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EP-VLM improves VLM efficiency by using event-based motion priors to sparsify visual inputs, reducing computation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of VLMs hinder deployment on edge devices due to redundant visual processing.

Method: EP-VLM leverages event data for patch-wise sparsification of RGB inputs and uses a position-preserving tokenization strategy.

Result: EP-VLM reduces FLOPs by 50% while retaining 98% accuracy on RealWorldQA compared to Qwen2-VL-2B.

Conclusion: Event-based vision priors enhance VLM efficiency, enabling sustainable edge deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack realism, failing to address complexities like dynamic backgrounds and color discrepancies in real-world scenes.

Method: HuSc3D features six detailed white sculptures with perforations and minimal texture, varying image counts per scene.

Result: The dataset effectively differentiates model performance, revealing sensitivities to geometry, color ambiguity, and data availability.

Conclusion: HuSc3D fills a gap in benchmarking by exposing limitations masked by conventional datasets.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

*Yuchong Long,Wen Sun,Ningxiao Sun,Wenxiao Wang,Chao Li,Shan Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraEdgeNet introduces a multi-scale edge-enhancement framework for high-precision automated pollen recognition, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models lack accuracy for microscopic objects like pollen due to their small size and complex backgrounds.

Method: HieraEdgeNet uses three modules: HEM for multi-scale edge features, SEF for fusing edge priors with semantic info, and CSPOKM for refining detail-rich layers.

Result: Achieves mAP@.5 of 0.9501 on 120 pollen classes, surpassing YOLOv12n and RT-DETR.

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet offers a robust solution for precise, efficient microscopic object detection by integrating edge information.

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

TL;DR: ROBIN, an MLM trained on densely annotated relationships, outperforms larger models in visual reasoning tasks by leveraging synthetic scene graphs refined by GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise reasoning over visual relationships remains a challenge in MLMs, despite advances in visual comprehension.

Method: ROBIN is trained on SVG, a synthetic dataset with missing relations filled by a teacher MLM and filtered for quality. SG-EDIT refines scene graphs using GPT-4o.

Result: ROBIN-3B outperforms similar and larger models, achieving SOTA in referring expression comprehension (88.9).

Conclusion: Refined scene graph data is key to high performance in diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

*Hangbei Cheng,Xiaorong Dong,Xueyu Liu,Jianan Zhang,Xuetao Ma,Mingqiang Wei,Liansheng Wang,Junxin Chen,Yongfei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMaMIL is a two-stage weakly supervised framework for lesion segmentation in histopathology images using only image-level labels, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lesion segmentation is crucial for diagnostics but suffers from limited pixel-level annotations. FMaMIL aims to address this challenge with weak supervision.

Method: 1. Mamba-based encoder captures long-range dependencies under MIL. 2. Frequency-domain encoding enhances spatial sensitivity. 3. CAMs guide segmentation training. 4. Pseudo labels are refined via soft-label supervision and self-correction.

Result: FMaMIL outperforms existing weakly supervised methods on histopathology datasets without pixel-level annotations.

Conclusion: FMaMIL is effective for lesion segmentation in digital pathology, offering a practical solution with minimal annotation requirements.

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

*Xiaohan Lu,Jiaye Fu,Jiaqi Zhang,Zetian Song,Chuanmin Jia,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSplat improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for wide-baseline novel view synthesis using a two-stage framework with a diffusion-based enhancement model and novel techniques (MORI, DWEA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation of 3DGS in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and geometric inconsistencies.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Generate 3D Gaussian primitives, 2) Enhance rendered views using a diffusion model optimized by MORI and DWEA. Joint training aligns data distributions.

Result: Achieves 1 dB PSNR improvement over SOTA methods on RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets.

Conclusion: ProSplat effectively enhances 3DGS for wide-baseline NVS, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through
joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K
datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that
ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent
SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3DGS for fine-grained scene understanding and enable flexible, text-driven instance segmentation without manual labeling.

Method: Combines feature-splatting with Segment Anything Model masks and contrastive loss, integrating vision-language model embeddings for text-driven identification.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on LERF-mask, LERF-OVS, and ScanNet++ datasets.

Conclusion: OpenSplat3D successfully enables open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation, advancing scene understanding capabilities.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
neural scene reconstruction, offering high-quality novel view synthesis while
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we extend the capabilities
of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling,
termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++
validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOVA3D is a novel single-image-to-3D generation framework that improves multi-view consistency and texture fidelity by leveraging 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and introducing innovative techniques like GTA attention and de-conflict geometry fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D AIGC often lack adequate 3D priors, leading to poor multi-view consistency. NOVA3D aims to address this by integrating strong 3D priors and geometric information.

Method: NOVA3D uses a pretrained video diffusion model for 3D priors, incorporates geometric information during fine-tuning, and introduces the GTA attention mechanism and de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments show NOVA3D outperforms existing baselines in multi-view consistency and texture fidelity.

Conclusion: NOVA3D advances 3D AIGC by effectively leveraging 3D priors and resolving multi-view inconsistencies, offering superior performance over current methods.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

*Weilei Wen,Chunle Guo,Wenqi Ren,Hongpeng Wang,Xiuli Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic filter network to address two classes of image degradations—spatial-agnostic and spatial-specific—improving reconstruction performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods treated all degradations uniformly, ignoring their diversity. The authors identify two distinct classes of degradations and propose a tailored solution.

Method: A dynamic filter network with global and local branches: global handles spatial-agnostic degradations (e.g., noise), while local addresses spatial-specific degradations (e.g., blurring).

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed network effectively addresses diverse degradation types, enhancing image reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowV2V introduces a flow-driven I2V generation method for video editing, improving temporal consistency and quality by decomposing the task into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motion patterns in video editing, especially for non-rigid objects. Optical flows offer a solution for better motion modeling.

Method: FlowV2V decomposes video editing into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, using pseudo flow sequences to align deformed shapes and ensure consistency.

Result: FlowV2V outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving DOVER by 13.67% and reducing warping error by 50.66% on DAVIS-EDIT.

Conclusion: FlowV2V demonstrates superior performance in handling complex motions and maintaining temporal consistency, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

*Yufei Guo,Yuhan Zhang,Zhou Jie,Xiaode Liu,Xin Tong,Yuanpei Chen,Weihang Peng,Zhe Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReverB-SNN, a method using real-valued spike activations and binary weights in SNNs to enhance accuracy while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary spike activations in SNNs often lack sufficient data information, reducing accuracy. The paper aims to address this by reversing bits for weights and activations.

Method: ReverB-SNN employs real-valued spike activations with binary weights, introduces a trainable factor for adaptive weight amplitudes, and uses re-parameterization for inference efficiency.

Result: Experiments show ReverB-SNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: ReverB-SNN effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in SNNs by leveraging real-valued activations and adaptive binary weights.

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETA introduces an asynchronous system to shift intensive computations to prior time steps, enabling large models to respond promptly while maintaining near-real-time inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dilemma of benefiting from large models without sacrificing inference speed in self-driving systems.

Method: ETA propagates past features, uses a small model for real-time features, and integrates them via an action mask mechanism.

Result: Achieves 8% performance improvement (69.53 driving score) on Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2 with 50 ms inference speed.

Conclusion: ETA successfully balances performance and speed, advancing state-of-the-art in self-driving systems.

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at
50 ms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses high energy consumption in 3D object detection, leveraging SNNs' low-power potential for applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Introduces SpikeSMOKE with CSGC for feature enhancement and lightweight residual blocks to reduce computation while maintaining performance.

Result: Achieves improved AP scores on KITTI dataset (e.g., +3.17 for Hard) with 72.2% energy reduction and 4% performance drop compared to SMOKE.

Conclusion: SpikeSMOKE offers an efficient, low-power solution for 3D object detection, balancing performance and energy savings.

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

TL;DR: AssetDropper is a framework for extracting standardized assets from reference images, addressing challenges like perspective distortion and occlusion, using a reward-driven approach for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers prefer standardized asset libraries, but generative models haven't significantly improved this domain. AssetDropper aims to bridge this gap by extracting assets from open-world scenes.

Method: AssetDropper uses a pre-trained reward model for closed-loop feedback, extracts front views of subjects, and employs a synthetic dataset (200,000+ pairs) and real-world benchmark for evaluation.

Result: AssetDropper achieves state-of-the-art performance in asset extraction, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: AssetDropper effectively enhances asset extraction for designers, with potential for future research in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating
product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to
standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly
enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample
raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results
in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArchDiffBench, a dataset of 1,765 architectural images with style annotations, and ArchiLense, a framework using Vision-Language Models for automated style recognition and classification, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional architectural studies rely on subjective expert interpretations and suffer from regional biases. This study aims to provide an objective, automated approach for analyzing architectural styles.

Method: The study constructs the ArchDiffBench dataset and develops ArchiLense, a framework combining Vision-Language Models, computer vision, and machine learning for style recognition and classification.

Result: ArchiLense achieves 92.4% consistency with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effectively capturing stylistic differences.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an objective, accurate alternative to traditional methods for comparative architectural studies.

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as
a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by
animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream
video tasks.

### [273] [Difference Inversion: Interpolate and Isolate the Difference with Token Consistency for Image Analogy Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07750)
*Hyunsoo Kim,Donghyun Kim,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Difference Inversion, a method to generate image B' by isolating and applying the difference between A and A' to B, avoiding model-specific limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on specific models, leading to biases or limited editing. A general solution is needed.

Method: Uses Difference Inversion with Delta Interpolation, Token Consistency Loss, and Zero Initialization to extract and apply differences.

Result: Outperforms baselines, generating feasible B' in a model-agnostic way.

Conclusion: Difference Inversion is effective for image editing without model dependency.

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

TL;DR: A fashion recommendation system using visual embeddings, semantic segmentation, and user behavior simulation to balance style and trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a personalized fashion recommendation system that integrates visual, semantic, and popularity cues for better user alignment.

Method: Uses deep visual embeddings (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16) with garment-aware segmentation, synthetic purchase histories, and a weighted scoring function for recommendations.

Result: Achieves 64.95% category similarity and low popularity MAE on DeepFashion dataset, with gender alignment and improved relevance.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable framework for personalized fashion recommendations, balancing individual style with trends.

Abstract: We introduce a trend-aware and visually-grounded fashion recommendation
system that integrates deep visual representations, garment-aware segmentation,
semantic category similarity and user behavior simulation. Our pipeline
extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic
segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones
(ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we
generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%
category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the
complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a
scalable framework for personalized fashion recommendations that balances
individual style with emerging trends. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: VLAgent is an AI system that improves multimodal visual-text reasoning by generating step-by-step plans and executing them with verification, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) lack generalization performance, prompting the development of VLAgent for better visual reasoning.

Method: VLAgent uses in-context learning to generate planning scripts, refines neuro-symbolic modules for execution, and employs syntax-semantics parsing and ensemble methods.

Result: VLAgent significantly outperforms existing VLMs and LLM-based approaches on benchmarks like GQA, MME, NLVR2, and VQAv2.

Conclusion: VLAgent's novel optimization modules (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer, Output Verifiers) enhance multimodal reasoning, setting a new standard for performance.

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

*Beining Xu,Junxian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-spectrum dataset and a task-aware evaluation framework for visible-infrared image fusion, highlighting gaps in current methods and evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations for visible-infrared image fusion lack standardized benchmarks and downstream task performance metrics, hindering progress.

Method: Constructed a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset and proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection performance.

Result: Fusion models optimized for downstream tasks outperform others, especially in low-light and occluded scenes. Some algorithms excelling in general metrics fail in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a dataset, evaluation framework, and comparative analysis, addressing gaps in current practices and guiding future research.

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our
proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum
dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive
evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion
methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RCTS, a multimodal RAG framework for LVLMs, addressing challenges like knowledge scarcity and erratic responses by enriching the knowledge base with reasoning context and using tree search re-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with knowledge scarcity and inconsistent responses in VQA tasks, prompting the need for improved multimodal RAG methods.

Method: RCTS constructs a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge base and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search with Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) for re-ranking.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQA datasets, outperforming ICL and Vanilla-RAG methods.

Conclusion: RCTS effectively enhances LVLMs by leveraging high-quality contextual reasoning, demonstrating significant improvements in VQA tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

*Eduard Allakhverdov,Dmitrii Tarasov,Elizaveta Goncharova,Andrey Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to interpret vision encoders via image reconstruction, comparing SigLIP and SigLIP2 models, and reveals insights into feature representation and color encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how vision encoders internally represent features, given their widespread use in vision-only and multimodal systems.

Method: A novel approach using image reconstruction to analyze feature representations, comparing models with different training objectives (SigLIP vs. SigLIP2).

Result: Encoders pre-trained on image tasks retain more image information than those trained on non-image tasks. Feature manipulation shows orthogonal rotations control color encoding.

Conclusion: The method provides insights into vision encoder feature spaces and is applicable to any encoder, with code and models available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UGTSR, a novel framework for real image super-resolution, addressing inaccurate feature matching and poor texture detail reconstruction with uncertainty learning, Top-k matching, and an Align-Attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing codebook-based SR methods struggle with inaccurate feature matching and poor texture detail reconstruction.

Method: UGTSR introduces an uncertainty learning mechanism, Top-k feature matching, and an Align-Attention module to improve feature matching and texture reconstruction.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: UGTSR outperforms existing methods and will release code upon publication.

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

*Tieyuan Chen,Huabin Liu,Yi Wang,Chaofan Gan,Mingxi Lyu,Gui Zou,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task, Implicit Video Question Answering (I-VQA), and a dataset for scenarios where explicit visual evidence is missing. It proposes the Implicit Reasoning Model (IRM) with dual-stream modeling to handle contextual cues, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VideoQA work relies on explicit visual evidence, which fails for questions about symbolic meanings or deeper intentions. This gap motivates the I-VQA task and IRM framework.

Method: IRM uses dual-stream modeling (Action-Intent Module and Visual Enhancement Module) to deduce contextual clues and enhance visual representation.

Result: IRM outperforms GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and VideoChat2 by 0.76%, 1.37%, and 4.87%, respectively, and achieves SOTA in related tasks.

Conclusion: IRM effectively addresses I-VQA by leveraging implicit reasoning chains, demonstrating superior performance and potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in
traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in
anonymous repo: https://github.com/tychen-SJTU/Implicit-VideoQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasArbi is a self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution, outperforming prior methods by breaking scaling into smaller steps and using a coordinate-guided residual diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fixed-scale super-resolution lacks flexibility, and single-stage upsampling struggles with continuous scaling factors. Progressive upsampling with diffusion models is underexplored.

Method: CasArbi uses a self-cascaded diffusion framework, breaking scaling into sequential steps with a coordinate-guided residual diffusion model for continuous image representation.

Result: CasArbi achieves superior perceptual and distortion performance across arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

Conclusion: CasArbi effectively addresses the challenges of arbitrary-scale super-resolution, offering a flexible and high-performance solution.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

*Yongzhen Wang,Yongjun Li,Zhuoran Zheng,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2Restore is a novel Mixture-of-Experts-based Mamba-CNN fusion framework for robust all-in-one image restoration, addressing generalization and detail preservation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration methods struggle with generalization across varying degradations and balancing local details with global dependencies.

Method: M2Restore uses a CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism, a dual-stream CNN-Mamba architecture, and an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show M2Restore outperforms benchmarks in visual quality and quantitative performance.

Conclusion: M2Restore effectively addresses key challenges in image restoration, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

TL;DR: R3D2 is a lightweight diffusion model for realistic 3D asset insertion in autonomous driving simulations, overcoming limitations of neural reconstruction methods like 3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation platforms are resource-intensive and suffer from domain gaps, while neural reconstruction methods lack dynamic object manipulation and reusability.

Method: R3D2 is trained on a novel dataset of 3DGS object assets from AD data, enabling realistic rendering effects like shadows and lighting in real time.

Result: R3D2 enhances realism of inserted assets, enabling text-to-3D insertion and cross-scene object transfer for scalable AD validation.

Conclusion: R3D2 advances photorealistic simulation for AD validation, with dataset and code released to promote further research.

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models operate in memorization and generalization regimes. This study investigates their behavior under low-noise conditions, revealing divergence near the data manifold despite high-noise convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify diffusion models' behavior as denoisers under low-noise conditions, addressing gaps in understanding their robustness and interpretability.

Method: Systematic investigation using CelebA subsets and Gaussian mixture benchmarks to analyze denoising trajectories, score accuracy, and the impact of training set size and data geometry.

Result: Models trained on disjoint data diverge near the data manifold under low noise, even if high-noise outputs converge. Training set size, data geometry, and model objectives shape denoising behavior.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how diffusion models learn data distributions, highlighting implications for reliability in practical applications with small perturbations.

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F2Net is a frequency-aware framework for semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution remote sensing images, addressing computational and optimization challenges by decomposing images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning, but conventional methods lose fine details or fragment global context. Multi-branch networks also face inefficiency and training instability.

Method: F2Net decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs with dual sub-branches for short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these, guided by Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss.

Result: F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 on DeepGlobe and 83.39 on Inria Aerial benchmarks.

Conclusion: F2Net effectively balances detail preservation and computational efficiency, offering a robust solution for UHR image segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: PolyVivid is a framework for multi-subject video customization, ensuring identity consistency and interaction through VLLM-based text-image fusion, 3D-RoPE enhancement, and attention-inherited identity injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack fine-grained controllability for multi-subject customization with consistent identity and interaction.

Method: PolyVivid uses a VLLM-based text-image fusion module, 3D-RoPE enhancement, attention-inherited identity injection, and an MLLM-based data pipeline for high-quality multi-subject data.

Result: PolyVivid outperforms baselines in identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment.

Conclusion: PolyVivid advances multi-subject video generation with superior controllability and identity consistency.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

*Arash Rocky,Q. M. Jonathan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2Auto is a fully automated pipeline for video dataset annotation, combining SMART-OD for object detection and FLASH for consistent video instance segmentation, achieving accuracy comparable to manual annotation while reducing time and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated datasets for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to labor-intensive and expensive manual annotation processes.

Method: SAM2Auto uses SMART-OD for robust object detection and FLASH for real-time video instance segmentation, employing statistical approaches to minimize errors and ensure consistent tracking.

Result: SAM2Auto achieves accuracy comparable to manual annotation, reduces annotation time, and eliminates labor costs, handling diverse datasets without retraining.

Conclusion: SAM2Auto sets a new baseline for automated video annotation, addressing the dataset bottleneck in VLM development.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

*Zihui Zhang,Weisheng Dai,Hongtao Wen,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogoSP introduces an unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation method using local and global point features, outperforming existing methods by leveraging frequency-domain patterns for pseudo-label generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised methods rely on local features and simple grouping, missing richer semantic priors. LogoSP aims to discover 3D semantics from both local and global features.

Method: LogoSP groups superpoints based on global patterns in the frequency domain to generate accurate pseudo-labels for training a segmentation network.

Result: LogoSP achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets, surpassing existing unsupervised methods by large margins.

Conclusion: The learned global patterns in LogoSP effectively represent meaningful 3D semantics without human labels, demonstrating its superiority in unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

*Ivan Alberico,Marco Cannici,Giovanni Cioffi,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system for table tennis using event cameras, leveraging foveated vision for low latency and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard cameras struggle with high latency and motion blur in fast-paced table tennis, while event cameras offer higher temporal resolution and robustness.

Method: Uses event cameras and foveated vision (via eye-gaze data) to process relevant regions, reducing latency. Collects a dataset with 3D ground-truth trajectories and fits a prediction model.

Result: Achieves a 10.81x reduction in computational latency, with a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms, outperforming 30 FPS frame-based systems.

Conclusion: First egocentric trajectory prediction system for table tennis using event cameras, demonstrating significant improvements in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL-VAEs suffer from artifacts that degrade performance; VIVAT aims to fix these without major architectural changes.

Method: Modifies loss weights, padding strategies, and integrates Spatially Conditional Normalization.

Result: State-of-the-art PSNR, SSIM, and CLIP scores in benchmarks.

Conclusion: VIVAT effectively optimizes VAE training while maintaining simplicity, offering practical solutions.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

TL;DR: FreeGave models 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physics from multi-view videos without object priors, using a physics code and divergence-free module for velocity fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex physical motions at boundaries or require object priors, limiting their applicability.

Method: Proposes FreeGave, which introduces a physics code and divergence-free module to estimate velocity fields without inefficient PINN losses.

Result: Outperforms on future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation across datasets, with physics codes learning meaningful motion patterns.

Conclusion: FreeGave effectively learns 3D physical motion patterns without human labels, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STSSM, a spatio-temporal state space model, for efficient and high-performance optical flow estimation using event cameras, outperforming existing methods in speed and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras enable low-latency motion estimation, but existing deep learning methods lack computational efficiency, while asynchronous methods miss spatio-temporal information. The goal is to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes STSSM module and a novel network architecture to capture spatio-temporal correlations efficiently, leveraging state-space models.

Result: Achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations than TMA, and 2x lower computations than EV-FlowNet, with competitive performance on DSEC benchmark.

Conclusion: STSSM offers a highly efficient and performant solution for optical flow estimation with event cameras, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive
performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively
capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance
with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar
settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations
compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with
competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at

robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types
of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet
incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object
detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing

Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine
annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its
robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk
detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms
and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data
processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility
applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoM2P is a masked modeling framework for egocentric 4D understanding, addressing challenges in multimodal data by using efficient temporal tokenizers. It outperforms specialist models in tasks like gaze prediction and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric vision applications require understanding multimodal signals, but data heterogeneity and missing modalities make supervised learning difficult. Existing models struggle with dynamic camera motion and complex spatiotemporal structures.

Method: Proposes EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework with temporal tokenizers, enabling multitask learning for egocentric perception and synthesis tasks.

Result: EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models in tasks like gaze prediction, camera tracking, and depth estimation, while being faster.

Conclusion: EgoM2P is a scalable, general-purpose solution for egocentric vision, advancing research with its open-source release.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unlearning technique for video diffusion models to remove harmful biases using minimal multi-modal prompt pairs and a refusal vector approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generative models can produce harmful or illegal content due to biases in training data, necessitating a method to neutralize such concepts without retraining.

Method: Uses 5 multi-modal prompt pairs (safe/unsafe) to compute a refusal vector via latent differences, applied to model parameters. Low-rank factorization ensures robust concept isolation.

Result: Effectively neutralizes harmful content (e.g., nudity, violence) while preserving video quality and model performance.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust, data-efficient solution for unlearning harmful concepts in video diffusion models without retraining.

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Motivation: Extending text-based reasoning models to multimodal tasks, addressing the challenge of general-purpose visual-language reasoning through RL.

Method: Develops a Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline, creates the WeThink dataset, and explores RL with hybrid rewards.

Result: WeThink dataset improves performance across 14 MLLM benchmarks, and the pipeline enhances data diversity.

Conclusion: The approach advances multimodal reasoning, with potential for continuous improvement via automated data generation.

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Conclusion: Provides insights for selecting U-Net versions in remote sensing change detection, aiding researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs' in-context learning (ICL) is often shallow, relying on copying or majority voting rather than true understanding. Performance degrades with more demonstrations, and models copy answers. A new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline improves little, indicating VLMs don't effectively use demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if VLMs truly exhibit multimodal ICL (MM-ICL) or rely on shallow heuristics, especially under distribution shifts.

Method: Proposed MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline, adding generated rationales to demonstrations. Evaluated on perception- and reasoning-required datasets with VLMs of varying sizes.

Result: Performance degrades with more demonstrations; models copy answers. Limited sensitivity to shot count, retrieval, rationale quality, or distribution.

Conclusion: Current VLMs don't effectively utilize demonstration-level information in MM-ICL, questioning their true ICL capability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DTwinSeger introduces a two-stage RS approach using Digital Twin representation to decouple perception and reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RS approaches disrupt spatial relationships due to tokenization, limiting performance.

Method: DTwinSeger transforms images into structured DT representations, then uses an LLM for reasoning.

Result: Achieves top performance on RS and referring segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: DT representation effectively bridges vision and text, enabling complex reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Result: Structured dataset with over six million entries, useful for studying migration, urbanization, family dynamics, and disease spread.

Conclusion: Demonstrates successful transformation of archival material into research-ready data, with a case study from Elimäki parish.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark advance automated slide generation, with SlideMaster (a 7B open-source model) and SlideCoder demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: Manual slide creation is labor-intensive and requires expert prior knowledge.
Existing natural language-based LLM generation methods struggle to capture the

### [302] [SpaCE-10: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Compositional Spatial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07966)
*Ziyang Gong,Wenhao Li,Oliver Ma,Songyuan Li,Jiayi Ji,Xue Yang,Gen Luo,Junchi Yan,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaCE-10 is a benchmark for evaluating compositional spatial intelligence in MLLMs, revealing gaps in atomic and combined capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively assess spatial intelligence in MLLMs from atomic to compositional levels.

Method: Developed SpaCE-10 with 10 atomic and 8 compositional spatial capabilities, using a hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate 5k QA pairs for 811 indoor scenes.

Result: Advanced MLLMs lag significantly behind humans, with counting capability identified as a major limitation.

Conclusion: SpaCE-10 highlights critical gaps in MLLMs' spatial intelligence, offering insights and a benchmark for future improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are
available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CyberV introduces a cybernetic loop to enhance MLLMs for video understanding, improving accuracy and robustness without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current MLLMs in handling long/complex videos due to computational demands, lack of robustness, and accuracy issues.

Method: Proposes CyberV, a framework with a cybernetic loop (MLLM Inference System, Sensor, Controller) for self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic resource allocation.

Result: Significant improvements: 8.3% boost for Qwen2.5-VL-7B, 5.5% for InternVL3-8B on VideoMMMU, and 10.0% for Qwen2.5-VL-72B, outperforming GPT-4o and nearing human expert performance.

Conclusion: CyberV effectively enhances MLLMs for dynamic video understanding, demonstrating robustness and generalization across benchmarks.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OneIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-to-image (T2I) models across multiple dimensions like reasoning, text rendering, and style, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluations, especially for reasoning and stylization, prompting the need for a more systematic framework.

Method: OneIG-Bench is designed for fine-grained evaluation across dimensions like prompt-image alignment, text rendering, reasoning, stylization, and diversity, allowing flexible subset evaluations.

Result: The benchmark enables detailed performance analysis, helping identify model strengths and bottlenecks, and is publicly available for reproducible studies.

Conclusion: OneIG-Bench fills critical gaps in T2I evaluation, offering a structured, flexible, and comprehensive framework for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient method for real-time three-dimensional
football trajectory reconstruction from a single broadcast camera. In contrast
to previous work, our approach introduces a multi-mode state model with $W$
discrete modes to significantly accelerate optimization while preserving
centimeter-level accuracy -- even in cases of severe occlusion, motion blur,

latency suitable for live broadcast settings. Extensive evaluation on a
proprietary dataset of 6K-resolution Russian Premier League matches
demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need
for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method
for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football
environments.

Motivation: To enhance lung disease classification by addressing challenges in open long-tailed classification and improving the measurability of state-of-the-art techniques.

Method: Expands the dataset to 377,110 CXRs with 45 disease labels, introduces zero-shot learning, and features three tasks: long-tailed classification on noisy and gold-standard test sets, and zero-shot generalization to unseen diseases.

Result: Provides a high-quality benchmark dataset, consolidates advanced solutions (multimodal models, generative approaches, zero-shot strategies), and enhances disease coverage for real-world clinical settings.

Conclusion: Aims to advance clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for chest radiography by synthesizing insights from participating teams.

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

*Tuomas Oikarinen,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective, accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy for neuron explanations in mechanistic interpretability, using importance sampling and Bayesian aggregation to reduce costs and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating neuron explanations are noisy and expensive, making it unclear which methods produce the best explanations.

Method: Develops a crowdsourced evaluation strategy with importance sampling for input selection and Bayesian aggregation for rating noise reduction.

Result: Achieves ~30x cost reduction via importance sampling and ~5x reduction in required ratings via Bayesian aggregation.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable large-scale, reliable comparison of neuron explanation quality across popular methods for vision models.

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACA, a method to improve text-image alignment in MM-DiTs by addressing token imbalance and timestep-aware attention issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art MM-DiT models struggle with precise alignment between text prompts and generated content due to cross-modal attention suppression and lack of timestep-aware weighting.

Method: Proposes Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA), which dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions using temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment, combined with LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on T2I-CompBench, improving object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships in models like FLUX and SD3.5.

Conclusion: Balancing cross-modal attention is crucial for semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models, and TACA offers a parameter-efficient solution.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in
text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PairEdit is a visual editing method that learns complex editing semantics from image pairs without textual guidance, improving content consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual descriptions alone are insufficient for precise editing semantics, and existing exemplar-based methods still rely on text prompts.

Method: PairEdit uses target noise prediction, a content-preserving noise schedule, and distinct LoRAs to disentangle semantic variations from content.

Result: PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics and improves content consistency over baselines.

Conclusion: PairEdit offers a text-free solution for learning editing semantics from image pairs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UA-Pose is an uncertainty-aware method for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion, designed for partial references. It outperforms existing methods, especially with incomplete object observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods require complete 3D models or extensive reference images, limiting their use with partial references. UA-Pose addresses this gap.

Method: UA-Pose uses partial RGBD images or a single 2D image to initialize an incomplete 3D model, integrating uncertainty to distinguish seen/unseen regions. It employs uncertainty-aware sampling for online completion.

Result: UA-Pose shows significant performance improvements on YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, especially with incomplete observations.

Conclusion: UA-Pose enhances robustness and accuracy in 6D pose estimation and object completion for partial references, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

TL;DR: MADFormer combines autoregressive and diffusion models for image generation, improving performance and efficiency through block-wise partitioning and vertical mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrids of autoregressive and diffusion models lack systematic guidance on capacity allocation. MADFormer addresses this gap.

Method: MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial blocks, using AR layers for global conditioning and diffusion layers for local refinement.

Result: Block-wise partitioning improves high-resolution image performance, and vertical mixing enhances quality-efficiency balance (up to 75% FID improvement).

Conclusion: MADFormer provides practical design principles for future hybrid generative models.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Motivation: To advance 3D understanding for applications like design and robotics, leveraging autoregressive models inspired by language and image modeling.

Method: A unified LLM framework with detailed design choices for data representation and modality-specific objectives, extended with quantized shape encodings.

Result: Effective performance in rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and question-answering across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates 3D scenes with language and images, demonstrating practical utility in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating

language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive
models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a
unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D
modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on

TL;DR: MTV is a framework for high-quality audio-sync video generation by disentangling audio into speech, effects, and music tracks, supported by the DEMIX dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise audio-visual synchronization and diverse audio types, limiting video generation quality.

Method: MTV separates audio into speech, effects, and music tracks for fine-grained control, using the DEMIX dataset for training.

Result: MTV achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment.

Conclusion: MTV advances audio-to-video generation with improved synchronization and versatility, supported by the DEMIX dataset.

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without weight updates or auxiliary modules by addressing deterministic inversion challenges.

Method: Redesigns noise initialization with K-order Recursive Noise Representation and Stochastic Latent Modulation for visibility-aware sampling.

Result: Demonstrates effective dynamic view synthesis through structured latent manipulation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves dynamic view synthesis by leveraging noise initialization techniques.

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

TL;DR: ZeroVO is a visual odometry algorithm achieving zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments without predefined calibration. It uses a geometry-aware network, language-based priors, and semi-supervised training, outperforming prior methods by over 30% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VO methods rely on predefined or static camera setups, limiting their adaptability. ZeroVO aims to overcome this by enabling generalization across diverse, unseen domains.

Method: 1. Calibration-free, geometry-aware network. 2. Language-based semantic priors for robust feature extraction. 3. Semi-supervised training with unlabeled data for iterative adaptation.

Result: Over 30% improvement on KITTI, nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and a GTA-derived synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: ZeroVO eliminates the need for fine-tuning or calibration, offering a scalable, versatile solution for real-world VO deployment.

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world
deployment at scale.

Result: Dreamland improves image quality by 50.8% and controllability by 17.9%, with potential for embodied agent training.

Conclusion: Dreamland offers a scalable, adaptable solution for hybrid world generation, with code and data to be released.

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained
generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the
training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image
quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance
embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

### [317] [Hidden in plain sight: VLMs overlook their visual representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08008)
*Stephanie Fu,Tyler Bonnen,Devin Guillory,Trevor Darrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs perform worse than their visual encoders on vision-centric tasks due to ineffective integration of visual information and language priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLMs integrate visual and linguistic information and diagnose their failure modes in vision-centric tasks.

Method: Compare VLMs to their visual encoders across vision benchmarks, analyze degradation of vision representations, task prompt brittleness, and the language model's role.

Result: VLMs perform substantially worse, near-chance, due to ineffective use of visual information and inherited language priors.

Conclusion: The bottleneck lies in VLMs' inability to leverage visual information effectively, highlighting the need for better integration methods.

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

*Xun Huang,Zhengqi Li,Guande He,Mingyuan Zhou,Eli Shechtman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self Forcing is a new training method for autoregressive video diffusion models that reduces exposure bias by conditioning frame generation on self-generated outputs, improving video-level quality and enabling real-time generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses exposure bias in autoregressive video diffusion models, where models struggle with imperfect outputs during inference.

Method: Uses autoregressive rollout with KV caching during training, a few-step diffusion model, stochastic gradient truncation, and rolling KV cache for efficiency.

Result: Achieves real-time video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, matching or surpassing slower non-causal models.

Conclusion: Self Forcing effectively balances performance and computational cost, advancing autoregressive video diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

*Nick Jiang,Amil Dravid,Alexei Efros,Yossi Gandelsman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates high-norm tokens in Vision Transformers, identifies neurons causing irregular attention, and proposes a training-free method to mitigate this by shifting activations to an untrained token, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address noisy attention maps caused by high-norm tokens in Vision Transformers without requiring retraining.

Method: Shifts high-norm activations from identified neurons to an untrained token, mimicking register tokens' effect.

Result: Cleaner attention maps, improved performance in downstream tasks, and comparable results to models trained with register tokens.

Conclusion: Test-time registers offer a training-free solution for pre-trained models, enhancing interpretability and performance.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViGaL post-trains MLLMs via gameplay (e.g., Snake) using RL, enhancing multimodal reasoning without domain-specific data, outperforming specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalizable reasoning in MLLMs, inspired by cognitive science linking gameplay to transferable skills.

Method: Post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM with RL on arcade-like games (e.g., Snake) to enhance reasoning.

Result: Outperforms specialist models on multimodal benchmarks (e.g., MathVista, MMMU) while maintaining general visual performance.

Conclusion: Rule-based games are scalable pre-text tasks for unlocking generalizable reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive annotation. This work explores training with partial task labels and extends it to a zero-shot setting.

Method: StableMTL repurposes image generators for latent regression, using a denoising framework with task encoding and per-task conditioning. It adopts a unified latent loss and introduces a multi-stream model with task-attention for inter-task synergy.

Result: StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method successfully scales multi-task learning without per-task loss balancing, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify static and dynamic scene components and efficiently model complex, time-varying environments with varying object lifespans.

Method: Uses 4D Gaussian as an inductive bias and a novel density control strategy for training, enabling efficient handling of long space-time inputs.

Result: Outperforms prior Gaussian-based networks and matches optimization-based methods in accuracy while reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds.

Conclusion: 4DGT is a scalable, efficient solution for dynamic scene reconstruction, suitable for real-world and cross-domain videos.

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene
reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D
Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object
lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which
enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient
rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a
rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

TL;DR: GLProtein is a novel protein pre-training framework integrating global structural similarity and local amino acid details, outperforming prior methods in bioinformatics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in protein sequence analysis, integrating protein structural information (local to global) remains underexplored for enhancing functional insights.

Method: GLProtein combines protein-masked modeling, triplet structure similarity scoring, 3D distance encoding, and substructure-based amino acid encoding.

Result: GLProtein surpasses existing methods in tasks like protein-protein interaction and contact prediction.

Conclusion: GLProtein advances protein pre-training by unifying structural details, offering improved accuracy and functional understanding.

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dLLM-Cache, a caching framework to reduce inference latency in diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) by reusing intermediate computations, achieving up to 9.1x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) offer advantages over autoregressive models but suffer from high inference latency due to incompatible acceleration techniques like Key-Value caching.

Method: Proposes dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework combining long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates based on feature similarity.

Result: Experiments on models like LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B show up to 9.1x speedup, bringing dLLM latency close to autoregressive models.

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache effectively reduces inference latency in dLLMs without compromising performance, making them more practical for real-world use.

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces in-context RL (ICRL), showing that RL emerges in LLM inference through multi-round prompting with feedback, improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can exhibit RL-like behavior during inference by leveraging feedback to improve responses iteratively.

Method: Proposes ICRL prompting: multi-round prompting with numerical rewards for responses, using past responses and rewards as context.

Result: ICRL improves LLM performance across benchmarks (Game of 24, creative writing, ScienceWorld), even with self-generated rewards.

Conclusion: ICRL demonstrates RL-like behavior in LLMs, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing inference-time performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

*Adarsh Prasad Behera,Jaya Prakash Champati,Roberto Morabito,Sasu Tarkoma,James Gross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys strategies for efficient inference in Language Models (LMs), focusing on model selection (routing) and hierarchical inference (HI) to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMs are computationally expensive, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments like mobile or edge devices.

Method: Two strategies are explored: (i) routing to select models based on query complexity, and (ii) hierarchical inference (HI) to escalate queries through models until confident responses are found.

Result: These approaches reduce computation by using lightweight models for simpler tasks, improving efficiency.

Conclusion: Future research aims to enhance response times, adaptive model selection, and scalable deployment for real-world LM applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes E2H Reasoner, a curriculum learning method for improving reasoning in language models by scheduling tasks from easy to hard, showing better performance than vanilla RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning in language models, as RL alone is less effective for inherently difficult tasks.

Method: Curriculum learning with task scheduling from easy to hard (E2H), fading easy tasks to prevent overfitting, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Result: E2H Reasoner improves reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B to 3B), outperforming vanilla RL, with fewer samples required.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning via E2H scheduling is effective for improving reasoning in language models, especially for smaller models.

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: MarginSel improves ICL in LLMs by selecting hard examples, boosting F1-scores by 2-7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL effectiveness depends on example selection and order; MarginSel addresses this by adapting to test instances.

Method: Two-step method (MarginSel) selects hard examples for ICL prompts, enhancing model performance.

Result: Achieves 2-7% F1-score improvement over random selection in classification tasks.

Conclusion: MarginSel induces max-margin behavior, shifting decision boundaries beneficially for hard examples.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context
learning (ICL). However, the effectiveness of ICL is often sensitive to the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

TL;DR: GAGA is an efficient framework for TAG representation learning, reducing annotation costs by focusing on representative nodes and edges, and achieves competitive accuracy with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with TAGs due to complex textual data, and existing LLM-based methods require costly annotations. GAGA aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: GAGA annotates only representative nodes/edges, constructs an annotation graph, and uses a two-level alignment module to integrate it with the TAG.

Result: GAGA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods with just 1% of annotated data.

Conclusion: GAGA offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for TAG representation learning, reducing annotation burdens while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

*Yuxin Xiao,Sana Tonekaboni,Walter Gerych,Vinith Suriyakumar,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how style patterns in prompts affect LLM safety, showing they increase jailbreak success rates. It proposes SafeStyle, a defense method that outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if style patterns in prompts compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases vulnerability, and how to mitigate these risks.

Method: Evaluated 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks, analyzed style pattern impact, and proposed SafeStyle for defense.

Result: Style patterns inflate jailbreak success rates, correlating with pattern length and LLM attention. SafeStyle effectively maintains safety.

Conclusion: Style patterns pose safety risks, but SafeStyle offers a robust defense against such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

TL;DR: Self-RedTeam is an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm for LM safety alignment, where attacker and defender agents co-evolve, improving robustness and adversarial diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch in conventional LM safety alignment, where reactive patching lags behind emerging threats, by enabling dynamic co-adaptation.

Method: Uses a two-player zero-sum game framework with alternating attacker and defender roles, adjudicated by a reward LM, and includes hidden Chain-of-Thought for private planning.

Result: Achieves higher adversarial diversity (+21.8% SBERT) and robustness (+65.5% on WildJailBreak) compared to static methods.

Conclusion: Proposes a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution, enabling scalable and autonomous LM safety improvement via MARL.

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

TL;DR: The paper proposes GoCE, a method to enhance long-range dependency capture in transformers by using a differentiable causal adjacency matrix and causal-masked attention, outperforming CoM and improving self-evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of CoM in losing long-range dependencies due to causal masking, aiming to improve transformer architecture for causal learning.

Method: GoCE maps token representations to a sparse causal adjacency matrix, uses causal-masked attention and causal-MoE, and employs intervention consistency loss and self-evolution gates.

Result: GoCE outperforms baseline LLMs, improving long-range causal dependency capture and self-evolution capabilities.

Conclusion: GoCE surpasses CoM and offers insights for future causal learning and adaptive transformer research.

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address outdated pretraining knowledge and difficulty in incorporating chemical expertise in LLMs for chemistry tasks.

Result: Significant performance improvement in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks, surpassing GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Robust solution for integrating specialized tools with LLMs in chemistry, with open datasets and code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising
capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated
pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical
expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that
synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from
basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset
curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both
effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and
evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search
(HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and
execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level
fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM
that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for
advanced chemical applications. All datasets and code are available at

*Adam Breuer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel combinatorial algorithm for LDA topic model inference, offering faster convergence and better interpretability than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of practical algorithms with provable guarantees for topic inference in LDA models, crucial for applications in social science and causal inference.

Method: A non-gradient-based, combinatorial approach for estimating topic models, ensuring logarithmic parallel computation time and interpretability guarantees.

Result: The algorithm converges exponentially faster than existing LDA methods, provides interpretable topics, and maintains independence for causal inference.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art LDA, neural, and LLM-based topic models in semantic quality across diverse datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

*Michael K. Chen,Xikun Zhang,Jiaxing Huang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a method to improve LLMs' ability to learn coherent concepts by enabling multi-token training, showing significant improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with high-level conceptual understanding due to fragmented token-based learning, limiting human-like reasoning.

Method: CAFT redefines fine-tuning by allowing multi-token sequence learning, fostering concept-aware understanding.

Result: Experiments show CAFT outperforms conventional methods in tasks like text summarization and protein design.

Conclusion: CAFT democratizes multi-token learning for post-training phases, with broader implications for AI research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks, finding minimal nonlinearity often optimal for performance, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why nonlinearity is necessary in recurrent networks for tasks like memory and long-range temporal processing.

Method: Uses Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) to control nonlinearity and analyze its role across various tasks.

Result: Minimal nonlinearity is sufficient and often optimal, simplifying models while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity, benefiting both artificial and biological neural systems.

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

TL;DR: HeuriGym is introduced as a framework to evaluate LLM-generated heuristic algorithms for combinatorial optimization, addressing gaps in current benchmarks. It uses iterative refinement and a new metric, QYI, revealing LLM limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods are inadequate—either too closed-ended or subjective. HeuriGym aims to provide a rigorous, objective benchmark for heuristic algorithm generation.

Method: HeuriGym allows LLMs to propose heuristics, receive feedback via code execution, and refine solutions iteratively. Nine models are tested on nine problems.

Result: Top models score 0.6 on QYI (expert baseline: 1), highlighting limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.

Conclusion: HeuriGym offers a standardized benchmark to improve LLM problem-solving in scientific and engineering domains.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

Result: POET shows improved generalization and scalability in training LLMs, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: POET is an effective and scalable solution for training large-scale neural networks, addressing key challenges in LLM optimization.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of
artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models
remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this
challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that
uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,
POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a
fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral
properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function
with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CellCLIP is a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for high-content screening (HCS) data, improving alignment of perturbations with cellular effects and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in applying cross-modal contrastive learning to HCS data due to semantic differences in Cell Painting images and diverse perturbation classes.

Method: Uses pre-trained image encoders with a novel channel encoding scheme and natural language encoders for perturbations.

Result: Outperforms current models in cross-modal retrieval and downstream tasks, with reduced computation time.

Conclusion: CellCLIP effectively aligns perturbations with morphological effects, advancing HCS data analysis.

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explicit representations for novel class discovery are limited by noise and discreteness, prompting the need for a more efficient and versatile solution.

Method: NeurNCD combines Embedding-NeRF with KL divergence for semantic embedding aggregation, integrating feature query, modulation, and clustering for efficient feature augmentation.

Result: The framework achieves superior segmentation performance on NYUv2 and Replica datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NeurNCD offers a robust, data-efficient solution for novel class discovery, eliminating the need for dense labeled datasets or human supervision.

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced RWKV shows promise for lightweight, efficient vision tasks, highlighting architectural trade-offs and future potential.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in
enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains

sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid
quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)
architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By
integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing
component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation
and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.
  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of
14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST
datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the
quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of

TL;DR: A new NILM method combines image load signatures and continual learning to improve device identification and adapt to new loads, achieving higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NILM methods struggle with poor feature robustness and insufficient generalization due to complex load combinations and environments.

Method: Converts power signals into visual image load signatures, uses deep convolutional neural networks for classification, and employs continual learning to adapt to new loads.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances NILM performance by leveraging visual signatures and continual learning.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve recognition systems' robustness for low-resource languages by leveraging model editing and domain merging, outperforming meta-learning in transfer learning and out-of-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the under-representation of low-resource languages in recognition systems to enhance practical utility across diverse domains.

Method: Utilizes model editing and domain merging to generalize faster to new data distributions (e.g., alphabets) without relying on massive pretraining.

Result: Significant performance boosts in transfer learning and out-of-domain evaluation, even with the same training data.

Conclusion: The approach enables easier adoption of under-represented alphabets, expanding document recognition to more contexts and cultures.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

TL;DR: FIND improves test-time adaptation by addressing dynamic distribution shifts with feature clustering, outperforming existing methods by 30% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks suffer performance drops under distribution shifts, reducing Quality of Experience (QoE). Existing TTA methods struggle with dynamic, multiple test distributions.

Method: FIND includes Layer-wise Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN), and Selective FABN (S-FABN) to handle feature clustering and optimize normalization.

Result: FIND achieves a 30% accuracy improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FIND effectively addresses distribution shifts by leveraging feature clustering and adaptive normalization, enhancing both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FREE, an adversarial training approach for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using Early Exit strategies to improve inference speed without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs face challenges in real-world applications due to high inference latency. Training exit classifiers with limited labeled data is difficult.

Method: FREE employs a GAN-based framework where each exit includes a transformer layer and classifier, adversarially trained to mimic final-layer features.

Result: The method speeds up inference by 1.51x while maintaining performance, mitigating overthinking and mid-crisis phenomena.

Conclusion: FREE effectively balances speed and accuracy in VLMs, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

*Mahdi Salmani,Alireza Abdollahpoorrostam,Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for asymmetric black-box attacks, optimizing query costs in adversarial attacks by modifying search strategies and gradient estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume equal query costs, but practical scenarios involve asymmetric costs (e.g., content moderation). Effective algorithms for this are lacking.

Method: Proposes Asymmetric Search (AS) and Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST) to minimize total attack cost by favoring low-cost queries.

Result: Achieves up to 40% lower total query cost and smaller perturbations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework improves adversarial attack efficiency under asymmetric query costs and integrates easily with existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed diffusion model is proposed to detect anomalous trajectories (e.g., GPS spoofing) by integrating kinematic constraints, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the societal need to curb illegal activities (e.g., unauthorized fishing) by detecting fake trajectories, which is challenging due to AI-generated deep fakes and lack of labeled data.

Method: The proposed method uses a physics-informed diffusion model that incorporates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories violating physical laws.

Result: Experiments on real-world maritime and urban datasets show higher prediction accuracy for anomaly detection and lower error rates for trajectory generation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects anomalous trajectories by leveraging physical laws, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our

### [348] [Advancing Multimodal Reasoning Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models via Visual Perception Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07218)
*Tong Xiao,Xin Xu,Zhenya Huang,Hongyu Gao,Quan Liu,Qi Liu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perception-R1, a method to enhance multimodal perception and reasoning in MLLMs using a novel visual perception reward, outperforming existing RLVR approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods focus on reasoning but neglect multimodal perception, a core prerequisite for MLLMs. This limits their reasoning improvement.

Method: Perception-R1 uses textual visual annotations from CoT trajectories and a judging LLM to assign visual perception rewards based on consistency with MLLM responses.

Result: Perception-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks with only 1,442 training samples.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances both perception and reasoning in MLLMs, addressing a critical limitation of prior RLVR approaches.

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

*Ziwen Wang,Jiajun Fan,Thao Nguyen,Heng Ji,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarCon improves contrastive learning by using variational inference for class-aware matching, achieving state-of-the-art results and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in contrastive learning: unregulated embedding distribution and reliance on large negatives/augmentations.

Method: Reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference, maximizing a posterior-weighted ELBO for efficient class-aware matching.

Result: Achieves 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, clearer decision boundaries, and superior few-shot learning performance.

Conclusion: VarCon enhances contrastive learning with better control over embeddings and improved generalization.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

*Haizhao Jing,Haokui Zhang,Zhenhao Shang,Rong Xiao,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeDG-Former integrates language-based semantic embedding and dynamic graph representation learning to improve neural architecture representation, addressing hardware attribute neglect and static adjacency limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods overlook hardware attributes and rely on static adjacency matrices, limiting practical applicability and encoding effectiveness.

Method: Proposes LeDG-Former, combining language embedding (using LLMs) for unified semantic space projection and dynamic graph-based transformer for neural architecture modeling.

Result: Achieves SOTA on NNLQP benchmark, enables cross-hardware latency prediction, and excels on NAS-Bench datasets.

Conclusion: LeDG-Former effectively addresses prior limitations and advances neural architecture representation learning.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular object-centric representations are crucial for human-like reasoning but face challenges under spatial ambiguities like occlusions and view ambiguities.

Method: Introduces a multi-view probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture invariant content and disentangled viewpoint-level information.

Result: Validated on benchmarks and complex datasets, the method shows robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: The approach effectively resolves spatial ambiguities and provides theoretical guarantees without requiring viewpoint annotations.

Abstract: Modular object-centric representations are essential for *human-like
reasoning* but are challenging to obtain under spatial ambiguities, *e.g. due
to occlusions and view ambiguities*. However, addressing challenges presents
both theoretical and practical difficulties. We introduce a novel multi-view
probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture
*invariant content* information while simultaneously learning disentangled
global *viewpoint-level* information. Unlike prior single-view methods, our
approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for
identifiability, and requires *no viewpoint annotations*. Extensive experiments
on standard benchmarks and novel complex datasets validate our method's
robustness and scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for counterfactual image generation integrates semantic representations and Pearlian causality to improve identity preservation and causal control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in counterfactual image generation, such as identity preservation, perceptual quality, and faithfulness to causal models, by leveraging advancements in diffusion models.

Method: Proposes a suite of diffusion-based causal mechanisms (spatial, semantic, dynamic abduction) and integrates semantic representations into diffusion models using Pearlian causality for counterfactual editing.

Result: Demonstrates principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity preservation, achieving high-level semantic identity preservation in diffusion counterfactuals.

Conclusion: The framework advances counterfactual image editing by combining diffusion models' visual quality with semantic and causal control, offering a novel approach to the field.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

*Kevin Rojas,Yuchen Zhu,Sichen Zhu,Felix X. -F. Ye,Molei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for multimodal diffusion models enables native generation of coupled data across modalities without relying on external preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joint multimodal data generation rely heavily on external preprocessing, which is problematic for limited-data applications.

Method: Proposes a framework with a decoupled noise schedule for each modality, allowing unconditional and modality-conditioned generation in a single model.

Result: Validated for text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, achieving competitive performance.

Conclusion: The framework lifts restrictions of external preprocessing and enables flexible multimodal data generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

*Boya Zeng,Yida Yin,Zhiqiu Xu,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current generative models for synthesizing neural network weights largely memorize training checkpoints, failing to create novel or superior weights compared to simple baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of generative models to synthesize novel and high-performing neural network weights, beyond memorizing training checkpoints.

Method: Examined four representative methods for weight generation, comparing their outputs to training checkpoints and simple baselines like noise addition or weight ensembles.

Result: Methods produced replicas or interpolations of training data, failing to outperform baselines. Memorization persisted despite mitigation attempts.

Conclusion: Generative models currently struggle with novel weight synthesis, emphasizing the need for careful evaluation in new domains.

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

### [355] [Reducing Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models via Audio-Aware Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07233)
*Tzu-wen Hsu,Ke-Han Lu,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD) reduces hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) by using contrastive decoding to prioritize tokens influenced by audio context, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior LALMs exhibit hallucination issues, generating incorrect responses about audio content. AAD aims to mitigate this by leveraging audio context during inference.

Method: AAD employs contrastive decoding to compare token predictions with and without audio, favoring tokens whose probability increases with audio.

Result: AAD improves F1 scores by 0.046 to 0.428 on hallucination datasets and boosts accuracy by 5.4% to 10.3% on general audio QA tasks.

Conclusion: AAD effectively reduces hallucination in LALMs and enhances performance, demonstrating its utility as a lightweight inference-time strategy.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each
component in AAD.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Proposes Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC) to improve multi-talker speech recognition without auxiliary info, reducing errors by 26%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of Serialized Output Training (SOT) in speaker assignment and challenges in extracting auxiliary info like timestamps.

Method: Extends CTC to jointly assign tokens and speaker labels per frame, integrating SD-CTC into SOT for speaker distinction.

Result: SD-CTC with SOT reduces error rate by 26%, matching state-of-the-art methods using auxiliary info.

Conclusion: SD-CTC enhances SOT performance without needing auxiliary data, offering a practical solution for multi-talker recognition.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

*Yitao Liu,Chenglei Si,Karthik Narasimhan,Shunyu Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CER enables LLM agents to self-improve by replaying past experiences, improving adaptability in complex tasks like web navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack environment-specific experiences and continual learning during inference, limiting their performance in sequential decision-making tasks.

Method: Proposes Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework that accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer for retrieval in new tasks.

Result: CER achieves 31.9% on VisualWebArena and 36.7% on WebArena, improving GPT-4o baseline by 51.0%.

Conclusion: CER effectively enhances LLM agents' adaptability and performance in complex environments through experience replay.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games, tasks based on LLM probability measures, to benchmark LLM capabilities through game-theoretic axioms and evolutionary dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore what it means for LLMs to know probability measures on text and extend their applications beyond generative sampling.

Method: Formulate Xent Games involving cross-entropy scores and constraints, expressed as computational graphs, and construct benchmarks from these games.

Result: The Xent Game space is rich and constructible, enabling the creation of capability benchmarks for LLMs.

Conclusion: Xent Games provide a framework for measuring LLM abilities, addressing scope challenges through evolutionary dynamics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

*Akash Gupta,Amos Storkey,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A meta-learning approach improves few-shot learning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by distilling task-relevant image features into soft prompts, outperforming in-context learning (ICL) and prompt-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent ICL performance in smaller LMMs due to irrelevant image embedding information.

Method: Proposes a meta-learning approach with soft prompts distilled from task-relevant image features, integrated via an attention-mapper module.

Result: Outperforms ICL and prompt-tuning on VL-ICL Bench, even under image perturbations.

Conclusion: The method enhances task induction and reasoning in LMMs under low-data regimes.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the capabilities and limitations of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using controllable puzzle environments, revealing their performance collapse at high complexities and inconsistent reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient understanding of LRMs' fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations, especially in reasoning traces beyond final answer accuracy.

Method: Systematic investigation using controllable puzzle environments to manipulate complexity while analyzing both final answers and internal reasoning traces.

Result: LRMs show accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities, exhibit a scaling limit in reasoning effort, and perform inconsistently across task complexities compared to standard LLMs.

Conclusion: LRMs have limitations in exact computation and inconsistent reasoning, raising questions about their capabilities despite their advantages in medium-complexity tasks.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper addresses behavioral hallucinations in multimodal large language models, introducing SHE, a lightweight framework to detect and mitigate them, and a new metric (BEACH) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral hallucinations in sequential images are understudied, limiting model reliability. The work aims to address this gap by identifying key causes and proposing a solution.

Method: SHE, a two-stage framework: (1) detects hallucinations via visual-textual alignment with adaptive temporal windows, (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection in joint embedding space.

Result: SHE reduces behavioral hallucinations by over 10% on BEACH while maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed SHE framework effectively addresses behavioral hallucinations, improving model reliability for sequential image tasks.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

TL;DR: SAFEFLOW is a protocol-level framework for secure and reliable LLM/VLM-based agents, enforcing fine-grained information flow control and robust multi-agent coordination, validated by SAFEFLOWBENCH.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent frameworks lack mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination, making them fragile.

Method: SAFEFLOW introduces fine-grained IFC, transactional execution, conflict resolution, secure scheduling, write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches.

Result: Agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain high task performance and security, outperforming state-of-the-art in adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH advance reliable autonomy by providing principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

Motivation: To explore whether modern LLMs can tackle the historically unsolvable Frame Problem and Symbol Grounding Problem in AI.

Method: Designed two benchmark tasks reflecting these problems, tested 13 LLMs under zero-shot conditions, and scored responses based on reasoning, coherence, and filtering.

Result: Closed models consistently scored high, while open-source models varied due to factors like size and tuning.

Conclusion: Some modern LLMs may have the capacity to meaningfully address these long-standing theoretical challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

### [364] [LUCIFER: Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07915)
*Dimitris Panagopoulos,Adolfo Perrusquia,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LUCIFER integrates hierarchical decision-making, RL, and LLMs to bridge the gap between human contextual insights and autonomous systems, improving exploration and decision quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of translating human contextual knowledge into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes LUCIFER, a framework combining hierarchical decision-making, RL, and LLMs, using LLMs as context extractors and exploration facilitators.

Result: LUCIFER outperforms flat, goal-conditioned policies, enhancing exploration efficiency and decision quality.

Conclusion: Context-driven decision-making, leveraging human insights, holds potential for autonomous systems' operational success.

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

### [365] [Solving Inequality Proofs with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07927)
*Jiayi Sheng,Luna Lyu,Jikai Jin,Tony Xia,Alex Gu,James Zou,Pan Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IneqMath, a dataset for inequality proving, and evaluates LLMs, revealing their limitations in rigorous proof construction despite strong final-answer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inequality proving is a challenging task for LLMs, but existing datasets are limited. The paper aims to provide a better dataset and evaluation framework.

Method: Proposes a task formulation with two subtasks (bound estimation and relation prediction), releases the IneqMath dataset, and develops an LLM-as-judge evaluation framework.

Result: Top LLMs achieve <10% accuracy under step-wise scrutiny, showing a 65.5% drop from final-answer accuracy, highlighting proof construction weaknesses.

Conclusion: Scaling model size has limited impact; future work should focus on theorem-guided reasoning and self-refinement.

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at
https://ineqmath.github.io/.

### [366] [Reinforcing Multimodal Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07963)
*Jixiang Hong,Yiran Zhang,Guanzhong Wang,Yi Liu,Ji-Rong Wen,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-supervised dual reward mechanism improves large multimodal models (LMMs) by reinforcing understanding and generation capabilities without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with accurate image-text alignment and require external supervision for unidirectional tasks. Understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, inspiring a self-supervised solution.

Method: A dual reward mechanism samples multiple outputs for a given input, reverses input-output pairs, and computes dual likelihood as self-rewards for optimization.

Result: The method enhances LMM performance, especially in text-to-image tasks, without external supervision.

Conclusion: The self-supervised dual reward mechanism effectively improves LMMs' understanding and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

*Victor Barres,Honghua Dong,Soham Ray,Xujie Si,Karthik Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	au^2$-bench, a benchmark for conversational AI agents in dual-control environments, addressing gaps in existing single-control benchmarks. It includes a Telecom domain, task generator, user simulator, and performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks simulate single-control environments, lacking realism for scenarios like technical support where users actively participate. $	au^2$-bench aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The benchmark features a Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, a compositional task generator, a reliable user simulator, and fine-grained performance analysis.

Result: Experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting challenges in guiding users.

Conclusion: $	au^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents needing effective reasoning and user guidance.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

TL;DR: VisioMath is a new benchmark for evaluating LMMs' mathematical reasoning with image-based answer choices, revealing significant limitations in current models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LMMs lack evaluation for mathematical reasoning with image-based options, a critical gap in multimodal comprehension.

Method: VisioMath includes 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions with image-based answers, testing fine-grained distinctions.

Result: State-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly (45.9% accuracy), highlighting challenges in visual reasoning.

Conclusion: VisioMath fills a crucial gap, providing a testbed for advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform
mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

*Cuong Manh Hoang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) in imbalanced datasets, using self-guided labeling and representation balancing to improve performance on tail classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods perform well on balanced datasets but struggle with real-world imbalanced data, necessitating a solution for long-tailed distributions.

Method: Proposes a self-guided labeling technique for pseudo-label generation and a representation balancing process to enhance focus on tail classes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in handling imbalanced data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses GCD challenges in long-tailed distributions, improving performance on tail classes.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Reflection is a framework enhancing MLLMs for GUI automation with self-reflection and error correction, using automated data generation and iterative training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI models lack reflection and error recovery, relying on error-free offline trajectories. GUI-Reflection aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The framework includes GUI-specific pre-training, offline SFT, and online reflection tuning, with automated data pipelines and a task suite for reflection-oriented abilities.

Result: GUI-Reflection enables self-reflection and error correction without human annotation, using scalable data pipelines and an iterative tuning algorithm.

Conclusion: The framework advances GUI automation by making it more robust and adaptable, with plans to release all resources publicly.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing
GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,
thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

*Yash Turkar,Youngjin Kim,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NightHawk optimizes robot vision in dim, featureless subterranean environments using active illumination and exposure control, improving feature detection by 47-197%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subterranean environments like culverts challenge robot vision due to poor lighting and lack of features, while onboard illumination causes issues like reflections and power drain.

Method: NightHawk uses Bayesian optimization to adjust light intensity and exposure-time, with a feature detector-based metric for image utility. It's implemented as an event-triggered recursive pipeline.

Result: Field tests showed 47-197% improvement in feature detection and matching, enhancing visual estimation in tough lighting.

Conclusion: NightHawk effectively addresses subterranean vision challenges, improving reliability for robots in such environments.

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, leveraging edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration to improve real-time object detection accuracy and reduce latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional on-board and cloud-based object detection systems for CAVs face limitations in accuracy and latency, necessitating a new approach for real-time, reliable perception in dynamic environments.

Method: The ECOD framework integrates two algorithms: PACE for aggregating multi-CAV detection data and VOTE for consensus-based object classification, both operating at the edge for low-latency processing.

Result: Experimental results show ECOD improves object classification accuracy by up to 75% compared to single-perspective onboard methods, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration to enhance perception for latency-sensitive autonomous systems like CAVs.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DriveSuprim improves autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction by filtering candidates progressively, enhancing robustness, and stabilizing training, achieving top performance in safety-critical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-path predictions lack explicit safety assessment, and selection-based methods struggle with optimization and rare scenarios.

Method: Uses coarse-to-fine candidate filtering, rotation-based augmentation, and self-distillation for robust training.

Result: Achieves 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2, excelling in safety and trajectory quality.

Conclusion: DriveSuprim advances selection-based methods, ensuring safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

TL;DR: GTRS is a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning in autonomous driving, combining coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation to overcome limitations of static and dynamic trajectory scoring methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory scorers struggle with generalization—static vocabularies lack fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals miss broader distributions. GTRS aims to unify these approaches.

Method: GTRS integrates a diffusion-based trajectory generator, vocabulary generalization with dropout, and sensor augmentation for robust inference and generalization.

Result: GTRS achieved superior performance, winning the Navsim v2 Challenge, and approaches privileged methods using ground-truth perception.

Conclusion: GTRS provides a robust solution for trajectory scoring in autonomous driving, balancing coarse and fine-grained evaluation for better generalization.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

TL;DR: RoboCerebra is a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation, addressing gaps in current benchmarks by focusing on System 2 capabilities like planning and reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work underutilizes vision-language models' (VLMs) strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning, focusing mostly on reactive policies (System 1).

Method: RoboCerebra includes a large-scale simulation dataset, a hierarchical framework combining a VLM planner with a low-level controller, and an evaluation protocol for System 1-System 2 interaction.

Result: The benchmark features longer action sequences and denser annotations than prior work, and benchmarks state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules.

Conclusion: RoboCerebra advances the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners by evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled
instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However,
most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs'
strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

TL;DR: SpikePingpong integrates spike-based vision and imitation learning for high-precision robotic table tennis, achieving superior accuracy and performance over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of controlling high-speed objects in robotics, exemplified by table tennis, requires precise vision and strategic planning.

Method: Combines SONIC (spike camera for millimeter-level precision) and IMPACT (strategic planning) with a 20 kHz spike camera and neural networks.

Result: Achieves 91% success for 30 cm accuracy and 71% for 20 cm, outperforming prior methods by 38% and 37%.

Conclusion: SpikePingpong advances robotic control in high-speed tasks, enabling sophisticated gameplay strategies.

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic
control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

*Chenguang Huang,Oier Mees,Andy Zeng,Wolfram Burgard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes multimodal spatial language maps (VLMaps and AVLMaps) to fuse pretrained multimodal features with 3D environment reconstructions, enabling robots to ground language and multimodal queries for navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack integration with environment mapping, spatial precision, or multimodal information beyond vision.

Method: Autonomously build visual-language maps (VLMaps) and extend them to audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) by fusing pretrained multimodal features with 3D reconstructions. Combine with LLMs for natural language command translation and obstacle map generation.

Result: Enables zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation, improves recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios, and supports diverse robot embodiments.

Conclusion: Multimodal spatial language maps enhance robot navigation and interaction by integrating visual, audio, and spatial cues, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

### [378] [MapBERT: Bitwise Masked Modeling for Real-Time Semantic Mapping Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07350)
*Yijie Deng,Shuaihang Yuan,Congcong Wen,Hao Huang,Anthony Tzes,Geeta Chandra Raju Bethala,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MapBERT is a novel framework using BitVAE and masked transformers to model unseen indoor spaces, improving semantic map generation for robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with real-time generation and generalization of unobserved areas in indoor environments.

Method: Leverages BitVAE for compact bitwise encoding of semantic maps and a masked transformer for inference. Introduces object-aware masking and learnable embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Gibson benchmarks, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: MapBERT effectively models indoor semantic distributions, enhancing robotic spatial awareness.

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

*Hongyu Wang,Chuyan Xiong,Ruiping Wang,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BitVLA is a 1-bit Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for robotics, achieving efficient performance with minimal memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying large VLA models on resource-constrained robotic systems by exploring 1-bit pretraining.

Method: Introduces BitVLA, a ternary parameter model, and a distillation-aware training strategy to compress the vision encoder to 1.58-bit weights.

Result: BitVLA matches state-of-the-art performance with 4-bit models on the LIBERO benchmark while using only 29.8% of the memory.

Conclusion: BitVLA demonstrates potential for efficient deployment on edge devices, with code and weights publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Guancheng Wan,Miao Yu,Kun Wang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: G-Memory is a hierarchical memory system for multi-agent systems (MAS) that improves collaboration and success rates by leveraging nuanced inter-agent interactions and cross-trial knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS memory architectures are simplistic and lack customization, hindering self-evolution and collaboration.

Method: G-Memory uses a three-tier graph hierarchy (insight, query, interaction graphs) for bi-directional memory traversal and evolution.

Result: G-Memory boosts success rates by up to 20.89% in embodied action and 10.12% in knowledge QA across benchmarks.

Conclusion: G-Memory enhances MAS performance without framework modifications, enabling progressive evolution of agent teams.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

TL;DR: MedChat is a multi-agent framework combining specialized vision models and role-specific LLMs to improve glaucoma detection and reporting, addressing challenges like hallucinations and limited interpretability in general LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and enhance clinical reporting efficiency by overcoming the limitations of general LLMs in medical imaging, such as hallucinations and insufficient domain knowledge.

Method: Proposes MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework with specialized vision models and role-specific LLM agents coordinated by a director agent, designed for interactive reporting.

Result: Enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and provides an interface for clinical review and educational use.

Conclusion: MedChat offers a robust solution for integrating deep learning and LLMs in medical diagnostics, improving accuracy and usability.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Adding location-based prompts to vague text queries improves retrieval performance in homogeneous domains like underwater scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains with homogeneous entities make text-based querying challenging due to vague user descriptions.

Method: Evaluated CLIP's performance using human-annotated underwater scene data with location-based prompts (3x3 partitioning and 5-grid overlap).

Result: Both partitioning methods significantly improved retrieval effectiveness and robustness to annotation box perturbations.

Conclusion: Location-based prompts enhance retrieval in specialized domains, addressing the limitations of vague text queries.

Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based
querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing
performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous,
specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can
often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to
discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding
location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance
retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human
annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding
boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using
these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various
static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that
both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve
retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation
box.

TL;DR: The paper warns of AI-driven disinformation via malicious swarms, proposing platform, model, and system-level defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI swarms threatens democracy by enabling covert, persistent disinformation campaigns.

Method: Proposes three strategies: platform defenses (e.g., swarm detection), model safeguards (e.g., watermarking), and system oversight (e.g., UN-backed observatory).

Result: Identifies risks like fabricated consensus and eroded trust, urging proactive measures.

Conclusion: Calls for immediate action to counter AI-driven disinformation through multi-layered safeguards.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;
and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance proactive preparedness for sudden-onset disasters like earthquakes by leveraging LLMs for efficient simulation.

Method: Utilize multimodal datasets (geospatial, socioeconomic, building, street-level imagery) and LLMs to predict MMI. Techniques like RAG and ICL improve performance.

Result: High correlation (0.88) and low RMSE (0.77) with USGS DYFI reports, especially with visual inputs enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for disaster impact simulation, aiding pre-event planning.

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,
socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did
You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced
by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study evaluates eight LLMs on their compliance with IHL, focusing on refusal clarity and helpfulness. Most models rejected unlawful requests, but response quality varied. A standardized safety prompt improved explanations, though vulnerabilities remained for complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' alignment with IHL and their ability to clearly refuse unlawful requests, aiming to improve AI safety and transparency.

Method: Evaluated eight leading LLMs on their refusal responses to IHL-violating prompts, testing clarity and consistency. Used a standardized safety prompt to measure improvements.

Result: Most models rejected unlawful requests, but response clarity varied. The safety prompt improved explanations, though complex prompts still posed challenges.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for clearer refusal mechanisms in LLMs and proposes a benchmark for IHL compliance, suggesting lightweight interventions can enhance safety.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

### [386] [Large Language Models Can Be a Viable Substitute for Expert Political Surveys When a Shock Disrupts Traditional Measurement Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06540)
*Patrick Y. Wu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) as a substitute for expert political surveys after disruptive events, demonstrating their effectiveness in analyzing the DOGE layoffs of 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disruptive events like the DOGE layoffs make it hard to reconstruct pre-event perceptions, necessitating alternative measurement methods.

Method: Pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs to derive ideology scores and analyze agency perceptions.

Result: LLM-derived scores replicated pre-layoff expert measures and predicted targeted agencies, including perceptions of agencies as knowledge institutions.

Conclusion: LLMs are viable for rapid testing of shock-associated factors when traditional methods fail, with proposed criteria for their use.

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic understanding of how workers want AI to automate or augment tasks and how this aligns with current technological capabilities.

Method: Developed an audio-enhanced mini-interview framework and the Human Agency Scale (HAS) to quantify worker preferences. Constructed the WORKBank database with input from 1,500 workers and AI experts across 844 tasks in 104 occupations.

Result: Tasks were categorized into four zones (Green Light, Red Light, R&D Opportunity, Low Priority), revealing mismatches and opportunities. Diverse HAS profiles showed varied expectations for human involvement.

Conclusion: AI agent development must align with human desires, and workers need preparation for shifting workplace dynamics, emphasizing interpersonal skills over information-focused ones.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper proves it's impossible for large language models (LLMs) to avoid hallucinations while meeting four key properties: truthful generation, semantic conservation, knowledge revelation, and optimality. It uses an auction-based model and the Green-Laffont theorem to formalize this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent limitations of LLMs in avoiding hallucinations and identify the trade-offs required in their design.

Method: Models LLM inference as an 'auction of ideas,' applying the Green-Laffont theorem to demonstrate the impossibility of simultaneously satisfying four properties.

Result: A formal impossibility theorem showing no LLM can avoid hallucinations while meeting all four desired properties.

Conclusion: The findings highlight unavoidable trade-offs in LLM design, guiding future work on architecture, training, and evaluation.

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference
process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimization framework for designing LLM watermarks, introducing two tunable watermarks (HeavyWater and SimplexWater) that balance detection accuracy and text distortion, especially in low-entropy tasks like coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in LLM watermarking, particularly in low-entropy tasks, by optimizing the use of random side information for better detection and minimal text distortion.

Method: An optimization framework for watermark design, leading to two new watermarks (HeavyWater and SimplexWater), which are tunable and agnostic to side information generation.

Result: HeavyWater and SimplexWater achieve high detection accuracy with minimal text quality compromise, especially in low-entropy scenarios, and reveal connections to coding theory.

Conclusion: The proposed watermarks effectively balance detection and distortion, offering practical solutions for LLM watermarking, with potential applications in coding and beyond.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be

TL;DR: Proposes a rank-based uniformity test to detect substitutions in black-box LLM APIs, ensuring model authenticity without access to weights or logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: API providers may covertly serve altered LLM variants (e.g., quantized or fine-tuned), degrading performance and safety, necessitating a detection method.

Method: Uses a rank-based uniformity test to compare black-box LLM behavior to a locally deployed authentic model, ensuring query efficiency and robustness.

Result: The method outperforms prior approaches in detecting threats like quantization, harmful fine-tuning, and model substitution under limited queries.

Conclusion: The proposed test effectively verifies LLM authenticity, offering accuracy and resilience against adversarial API providers.

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

TL;DR: HauntAttack is a black-box attack framework that embeds harmful instructions into reasoning questions, revealing safety vulnerabilities in advanced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the safety-reasoning trade-off in LRMs when reasoning is entangled with harmfulness.

Method: Introduces HauntAttack, which substitutes original conditions in reasoning questions with harmful instructions to guide models toward unsafe outputs.

Result: Advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety vulnerabilities under HauntAttack.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical security risks in LRMs and provides insights for improving their safety.

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the overlooked risk of implicit harm in LLMs, where harmless-looking inputs can lead to dangerous outputs. It introduces JailFlipBench to assess this risk and demonstrates its urgency through evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and mitigating implicit harm in LLMs, which conventional jailbreak attacks overlook.

Method: Proposes JailFlipBench, a benchmark for implicit harm, and develops JailFlip attack methodologies to evaluate LLMs across diverse scenarios.

Result: Evaluations reveal that implicit harm poses immediate real-world risks, necessitating broader safety assessments.

Conclusion: The study calls for expanded LLM safety measures beyond traditional jailbreak paradigms to address implicit harm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

### [393] [The Hype Index: an NLP-driven Measure of Market News Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06329)
*Zheng Cao,Wanchaloem Wunkaew,Helyette Geman*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hype Index, a metric using NLP to quantify media attention on large-cap equities, with versions adjusted for market capitalization. It evaluates the index's predictive power for returns, volatility, and market movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify media attention's impact on financial markets and provide tools for volatility analysis and market signaling.

Method: Constructs two versions of the Hype Index (News Count-Based and Capitalization Adjusted) using NLP on financial news, applied to the S&P 100. Evaluates through hype groups, associations with market metrics, and empirical properties.

Result: The Hype Index family is effective for stock volatility analysis, market signaling, and NLP applications in finance.

Conclusion: The Hype Index offers valuable tools for analyzing media-driven market dynamics and enhancing financial NLP applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media
attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using
the S&P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype
Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news
articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the
Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)
their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with
returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power
for short-term market movements, and (4) their empirical properties including
correlations, samplings, and trends. Our findings suggest that the Hype Index
family provides a valuable set of tools for stock volatility analysis, market
signaling, and NLP extensions in Finance.

### [394] [ProtocolLLM: RTL Benchmark for SystemVerilog Generation of Communication Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07945)
*Arnav Sheth,Ivaxi Sheth,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper explores the capabilities of LLMs in generating synthesizable and functionally correct SystemVerilog code for standard communication protocols, introducing a benchmark suite for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The applicability of LLMs for hardware description languages (HDLs) like SystemVerilog, which require strict adherence to timing and synthesizability constraints, remains underexplored.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark suite for four protocols (SPI, I2C, UART, AXI) and evaluates LLM-generated SystemVerilog code for syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity using waveform simulation and test benches.

Result: The study assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in generating HDL code, focusing on practical design tasks beyond structural code generation.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the potential and limitations of LLMs for hardware design, paving the way for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA deployment for RL is resource-intensive due to high computations with quality images, prompting the need for efficient solutions.

Method: QForce-RL uses E2HRL to reduce RL actions and QuaRL for quantization-based SIMD hardware acceleration, analyzing model size, parameters, and compute ops.

Result: Achieves 2.3x performance improvement and 2.6x better FPS compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: QForce-RL is scalable for resource-constrained devices, offering efficient deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential
decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is
significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of
computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new
challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization
to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL
architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes
advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and
QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also
provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on
model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is
scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient
deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy
efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x
and better FPS - 2.6x compared to SoTA works.

*Ali Abedi,Charlene H. Chu,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study developed machine learning models to predict agitation in dementia patients using multimodal sensor data, achieving high accuracy with a light gradient boosting machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agitation in dementia patients is common and disruptive; early prediction can improve care and reduce caregiver burden.

Method: Used machine learning and deep learning models on the TIHM dataset, introducing agitation-related contextual features from activity data.

Result: Best performance was binary classification with AUC-ROC of 0.9720 and AUC-PR of 0.4320 using light gradient boosting.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate, explainable agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

TL;DR: An open-source Python framework generates synthetic ECG image datasets for deep learning tasks like ECG digitization, lead detection, and waveform segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance deep learning-based ECG analysis by providing diverse synthetic datasets for critical tasks.

Method: Uses the PTB-XL signal dataset to create four datasets: paired ECG images and signals, annotated images for detection, and cropped single-lead images with segmentation masks.

Result: Produces open-access datasets for ECG digitization, lead detection, and segmentation, with overlapping waveform support.

Conclusion: The framework and datasets are publicly available, facilitating research in ECG analysis.

Abstract: We introduce an open-source Python framework for generating synthetic ECG
image datasets to advance critical deep learning-based tasks in ECG analysis,
including ECG digitization, lead region and lead name detection, and
pixel-level waveform segmentation. Using the PTB-XL signal dataset, our

digitization, (2) ECG images annotated with YOLO-format bounding boxes for
detection of lead region and lead name, (3)-(4) cropped single-lead images with
segmentation masks compatible with U-Net-based models in normal and overlapping
versions. In the overlapping case, waveforms from neighboring leads are
superimposed onto the target lead image, while the segmentation masks remain
clean. The open-source Python framework and datasets are publicly available at

### [399] [Heart Rate Classification in ECG Signals Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06349)
*Thien Nhan Vo,Thanh Xuan Truong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study compares traditional ML (hand-crafted features) and deep learning (image-based CNN) for ECG heartbeat classification. LightGBM outperformed CNNs, achieving 99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of hand-crafted features versus image-based deep learning for ECG heartbeat classification.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Traditional ML with features like HRV and RR intervals, trained on SVM, Random Forest, etc. 2) Deep learning using GAF, MTF, and RP images classified by CNNs.

Result: LightGBM (hand-crafted features) achieved 99% accuracy, outperforming CNN (F1=0.85). SVM and AdaBoost performed poorly.

Conclusion: Hand-crafted features are superior for ECG classification. Future work should explore multi-lead signals and temporal dependencies.

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

*Chuhao Chen,Zhiyang Dou,Chen Wang,Yiming Huang,Anjun Chen,Qiao Feng,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Vid2Sim is a novel framework for reconstructing geometry and physical properties from videos using a mesh-free, efficient approach based on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on costly optimization pipelines and hyperparameter tuning, limiting practicality and generalizability. Vid2Sim aims to address these limitations.

Method: Vid2Sim uses a feed-forward neural network to reconstruct observed configurations, followed by lightweight optimization for refinement. It enables mesh-free simulation post-reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing geometry and physical properties from videos.

Conclusion: Vid2Sim offers a generalizable, efficient solution for video-based system identification, outperforming previous approaches.

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos
presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been
dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.
Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a
differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,
these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for
each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their
practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and
physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile
representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the
observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward
neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight
optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and
physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few
minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality,
mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing
geometry and physical properties from video data.

*Nicolás Violante,Andreas Meuleman,Alban Gauthier,Frédo Durand,Thibault Groueix,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes leveraging repetitive elements in 3D scenes to enhance novel view synthesis by improving reconstruction of low-quality areas in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS struggle with unseen or occluded parts when training views are insufficient. The authors observe that environments often contain repetitive elements, which can be utilized to improve reconstruction.

Method: The method segments repeated instances in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them, and shares information among instances, improving geometry and handling appearance variations.

Result: The approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality in synthetic and real scenes with repetitive elements.

Conclusion: Leveraging repetitive elements in 3D scenes effectively improves reconstruction and synthesis quality for under-covered or occluded areas.

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

### [402] [Noise Consistency Regularization for Improved Subject-Driven Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06483)
*Yao Ni,Song Wen,Piotr Koniusz,Anoop Cherian*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes two auxiliary consistency losses to improve fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion for subject-driven image synthesis, addressing underfitting and overfitting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for Stable Diffusion struggle with underfitting (failing to capture subject identity) and overfitting (memorizing subject images and reducing background diversity).

Method: The authors introduce two losses: a prior consistency regularization loss to maintain fidelity and a subject consistency regularization loss to enhance robustness and diversity.

Result: The proposed method outperforms DreamBooth in CLIP scores, background variation, and visual quality, preserving subject identity while improving diversity.

Conclusion: The auxiliary losses effectively address fine-tuning challenges, enhancing both subject fidelity and image diversity in Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an architecture-algorithm co-design to optimize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices, achieving significant speedup and energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time rendering of 3DGS on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to power and area limitations. The paper aims to address inefficiencies in computation and sorting.

Method: The approach includes axis-oriented rasterization to reduce redundancy, a neural sorting method to replace hardware sorters, a reconfigurable processing array, and a tile scheduling technique.

Result: The design achieves a 23.4∼27.8× speedup and 28.8∼51.4× energy savings compared to edge GPUs while preserving rendering quality.

Conclusion: The proposed co-design effectively optimizes 3DGS for real-time applications, with plans to open-source the design for further development.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

*Lei Li,Angela Dai*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: HOI-PAGE synthesizes 4D human-object interactions (HOIs) from text prompts using part-level affordance reasoning, improving realism and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works lack fine-grained understanding of how human body parts interact with object parts, limiting realism and diversity in 4D HOI synthesis.

Method: Introduces Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs) from LLMs, guiding a three-stage synthesis: object decomposition, reference video generation, and motion optimization.

Result: Generates complex, realistic HOIs with better text alignment, outperforming prior zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: HOI-PAGE advances 4D HOI synthesis by leveraging part-level reasoning, enabling more realistic and diverse interactions.

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment
for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PIG improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by enabling precise 3D segmentation, multi-material interactions, and artifact-free rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inaccurate segmentation, imprecise deformation, and rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussian-based scene representations.

Method: Combines 3D object segmentation with physical property assignment and constraint scales in deformation gradients.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in visual quality and enables physically realistic scene generation.

Conclusion: PIG advances 3D scene reconstruction with improved accuracy and realism.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic
scene generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel method enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting resolution and fidelity beyond native training limits using a lightweight generative model and Hessian-assisted sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods are limited by input resolution, unable to extrapolate finer details. This work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Uses a lightweight generative model to predict and refine additional 3D Gaussians, with Hessian-assisted sampling for efficient densification.

Result: Achieves real-time performance (0.015s per inference) and improves geometric accuracy and rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Introduces a resolution-free 3D scene enhancement paradigm, practical for interactive applications.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpeeDe3DGS accelerates dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting by pruning low-contribution Gaussians and clustering motion, achieving faster rendering and smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Per-Gaussian neural inference in dynamic 3DGS is slow and resource-heavy, limiting real-time applications.

Method: Uses temporal sensitivity pruning and GroupFlow for motion clustering to reduce neural inference.

Result: Achieves 10.37x faster rendering, 7.71x smaller models, and 2.71x shorter training.

Conclusion: SpeeDe3DGS is a modular, efficient solution for dynamic 3DGS, improving speed and scalability.

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on

*Rishit Dagli,Yushi Guan,Sankeerth Durvasula,Mohammadreza Mofayezi,Nandita Vijaykumar*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Squeeze3D is a framework for high-ratio 3D data compression using pre-trained models, achieving impressive compression ratios for meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields without requiring real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage pre-trained 3D generative models for efficient 3D data compression, eliminating the need for object-specific training or real datasets.

Method: Uses trainable mapping networks to bridge latent spaces of pre-trained encoders and generative models, transforming 3D data into compact latent codes for compression and decompression.

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to 2187x for meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields with minimal latency and maintained visual quality.

Conclusion: Squeeze3D offers a flexible, efficient solution for high-ratio 3D compression across multiple formats using synthetic data and pre-trained models.

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

### [409] [ResPF: Residual Poisson Flow for Efficient and Physically Consistent Sparse-View CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06400)
*Changsheng Fang,Yongtong Liu,Bahareh Morovati,Shuo Han,Yu Shi,Li Zhou,Shuyi Fan,Hengyong Yu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) models improve sparse-view CT reconstruction by integrating conditional guidance, reducing sampling costs, and ensuring data consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT reduces radiation but poses reconstruction challenges. Current deep learning and diffusion methods lack interpretability or are computationally expensive.

Method: ResPF, based on PFGM++, uses conditional guidance, skips redundant sampling steps, and employs a residual fusion module to maintain trajectory continuity.

Result: ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality, faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ResPF is the first Poisson flow model for sparse-view CT, offering efficient, accurate, and robust reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce
radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and
diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical
interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,
particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image
synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose
Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional
guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to
significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.
However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce
unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each
iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling
relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by
electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,
resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we
introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with
data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow
models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical
datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,
faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art
iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

*Sumit Sharma,Gopi Raju Matta,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework converts binary Single Photon Camera (SPC) images into high-quality colorized novel views using generative models and 3D reconstruction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The binary nature of SPC images causes severe information loss, making traditional 3D synthesis ineffective.

Method: A modular two-stage approach: (1) image-to-image translation (Pix2PixHD) to convert binary SPC inputs to RGB, and (2) 3D reconstruction (NeRF/3DGS) for novel views.

Result: The pipeline shows significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of binary SPC data for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging
technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing
precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable
image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high
illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such
SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images
leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making
traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we
propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into
high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image
(I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary
SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D
scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline
(Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and
geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

### [411] [Optimal Transport Driven Asymmetric Image-to-Image Translation for Nuclei Segmentation of Histological Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07023)
*Suman Mahapatra,Pradipta Maji*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep generative model for nuclei segmentation in histological images, addressing information asymmetry between image domains using an invertible generator and optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuclei segmentation aids disease diagnosis, but existing image-to-image translation models fail with asymmetric information content between domains.

Method: The model uses an invertible generator with optimal transport and measure theory, eliminating cycle-consistency loss and incorporating a spatially-constrained squeeze operation.

Result: The model achieves a better complexity-performance trade-off than existing methods, validated on public histological datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively segments nuclei with lower complexity and improved performance, advancing histological image analysis.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

*Suman Mahapatra,Pradipta Maji*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep generative model for simultaneous nuclei segmentation and color normalization in histological images, using truncated normal distribution and spatial attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate nuclei segmentation and color normalization are critical for histological image analysis, but existing methods struggle with color variation and stain overlap.

Method: A novel deep generative model integrates truncated normal distribution and spatial attention, assuming disentangled representations for color appearance and nuclei segmentation.

Result: The model demonstrates effective performance on standard histological datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is generalizable and adaptable, addressing key challenges in nuclei segmentation and color normalization.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Conclusion: Deep learning with XAI can enhance brain tumor detection in resource-limited areas, offering a viable solution for timely diagnosis.

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable
health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and
uncontrolled proliferation, resulting in malignancy. Timely identification is
crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in nations such as
Bangladesh, where healthcare infrastructure is constrained. Manual MRI analysis
is arduous and susceptible to inaccuracies, rendering it inefficient for prompt
diagnosis. This research sought to tackle these problems by creating an
automated brain tumor classification system utilizing MRI data obtained from
many hospitals in Bangladesh. Advanced deep learning models, including VGG16,
VGG19, and ResNet50, were utilized to classify glioma, meningioma, and various
brain cancers. Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, such as Grad-CAM and
Grad-CAM++, were employed to improve model interpretability by emphasizing the
critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved
the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the
system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical
application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study
highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to enhance brain tumor detection and
identification in areas with restricted access to advanced medical
technologies.

*Gaoyu Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception network (TMC) to improve medical image segmentation by leveraging text prompts and enhancing cross-modal interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with weak semantic expression due to low contrast in medical images, and text-guided methods lack sufficient cross-modal interaction.

Method: TMC introduces a multistage cross-attention module for better semantic understanding and a multi-stage alignment loss for cross-modal consistency.

Result: TMC outperforms UNet-based and text-guided methods with Dice scores of 84.77%, 78.50%, and 88.73% on three datasets.

Conclusion: TMC effectively addresses limitations in medical image segmentation by improving cross-modal feature expression and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving
as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring,
thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However,
existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic
expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low
contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address
this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the
lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient
cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To
resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception
network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to
enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage
alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance
with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19,
MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided
methods.

*Xihua Sheng,Peilin Chen,Meng Wang,Li Zhang,Shiqi Wang,Dapeng Oliver Wu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancements for neural B-frame coding, focusing on fine-grained motion compression and selective temporal fusion, outperforming existing methods and matching H.266/VVC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural B-frame codecs inadequately address B-frame challenges by reusing P-frame tools, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduces a fine-grained motion compression method with adaptive quantization and an interactive entropy model, plus a selective temporal fusion method with hyperprior-based alignment.

Result: The proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and matches H.266/VVC performance.

Conclusion: The enhancements effectively address B-frame compression challenges, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame
coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most
existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without
adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to
suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for
motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we
design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an
interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive
quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional
motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and
reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an
interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between
bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging
partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a
selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to
achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal
contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a
hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.
By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent
representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the
fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and
achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC
reference software under random-access configurations.

*Huiyao Chen,Yi Yang,Yinghui Li,Meishan Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DISRetrieval is a hierarchical retrieval framework for long document understanding, leveraging discourse structure (RST) for improved performance over flat or chunked methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture document discourse structure, limiting their effectiveness for long document understanding.

Method: Uses RST for hierarchical document organization, LLM-enhanced node representation, and hierarchical evidence retrieval.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on QASPER and QuALITY datasets in retrieval and QA tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating discourse structure significantly improves retrieval, highlighting its importance for long-text understanding.

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident
data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) reports from 2000 to 2020, BERTopic employed transformer based
embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic
modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed
that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of

as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the
advantages of modern transformer based approaches in analyzing complex aviation
datasets, paving the way for enhanced insights and informed decision-making in

TL;DR: FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained on a financial corpus, outperforms LLMs and BERT variants in financial NLP tasks like classification, retrieval, and topic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in financial NLP, such as poor performance on discriminative tasks, reliance on RAG for generative tasks, and inadequacies in feature-based scenarios.

Method: Introduce FinBERT2, pretrained on a 32b-token financial corpus, and fine-tune it for discriminative (Fin-Labelers), retrieval (Fin-Retrievers), and topic modeling (Fin-TopicModel) tasks.

Result: FinBERT2 outperforms BERT variants (0.4%-3.3%) and LLMs (9.7%-12.3%) in classification, beats open-source and proprietary embedders in retrieval (+4.2%-6.8%), and enables superior topic modeling.

Conclusion: FinBERT2 bridges gaps in financial NLP deployment, offering practical insights for leveraging specialized models in the LLMs era.

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize RAG pipelines for Arabic, as prior work focused on high-resource languages.

Method: Empirical evaluation of RAG components (chunking, embeddings, rerankers, models) using RAGAS metrics on Arabic datasets.

Result: Sentence-aware chunking, BGE-M3, Multilingual-E5-large, and bge-reranker-v2-m3 performed best; Aya-8B outperformed StableLM.

Conclusion: Provides insights and guidelines for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG approaches lack structured reasoning from user-item interactions, limiting recommendation quality.

Method: Extends LlamaRec with a lightweight user preference module to dynamically identify relation paths in a knowledge graph, integrating them into LLM prompts.

Result: Outperforms LlamaRec on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets in MRR, NDCG, and Recall.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning enhances LLM-based recommendations, enabling scalable, knowledge-aware personalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty
datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec
across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates
the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and
establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in
next-generation recommender systems. Code is available

TL;DR: HotelMatch-LLM is a multimodal dense retrieval model for travel, improving natural language property search with domain-specific multi-task optimization, asymmetrical architecture, and image processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional travel search engines that require destination-first searches and parameter editing.

Method: Combines multi-task optimization (retrieval, visual, language), asymmetrical dense retrieval (SLM for queries, LLM for hotel data), and extensive image processing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models (e.g., MARVEL) with a score of 0.681 vs. 0.603 on the main query type.

Conclusion: HotelMatch-LLM is effective, generalizable across LLM architectures, and scalable for large image galleries.

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel
data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image
galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL.
Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for
HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our
analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the
generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its
scalability for processing large image galleries.
