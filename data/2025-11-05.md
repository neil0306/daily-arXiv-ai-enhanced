### [1] [Multi-Personality Generation of LLMs at Decoding-time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01891)
*Rongxin Chen,Yunfan Li,Yige Yuan,Bingbing Xu,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MPG framework for multi-personality generation in LLMs using decoding-time combination with speculative chunk-level rejection sampling, achieving 16-18% improvements without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-personality generation are either costly (retraining-based) or rely on external models/heuristics, limiting flexibility and robustness.

Method: MPG framework uses implicit density ratios from single-dimensional models as "free lunch" to sample from target strategy, implemented via Speculative Chunk-level Rejection sampling (SCR) for efficient chunk generation and parallel validation.

Result: Experiments on MBTI personality and Role-Playing show effectiveness with improvements up to 16-18% over existing methods.

Conclusion: MPG provides flexible multi-personality control without external models or extra training, offering efficient and high-quality generation through innovative sampling approach.

Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of
multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing
retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time
methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation
(MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly
controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models
or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional
models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target
strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design
Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates
responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds
within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead
while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and
Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to
16%-18%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Libra117/MPG .

### [2] [Rethinking LLM Human Simulation: When a Graph is What You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02135)
*Joseph Suh,Suhong Moon,Serina Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMS uses graph neural networks as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation tasks, achieving comparable or better accuracy with much greater efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if smaller, domain-grounded models can suffice for human simulation tasks instead of large language models, given LLMs' computational demands.

Method: Casts discrete choice simulation as link prediction on graphs using GNNs, incorporating language representations only when necessary.

Result: GEMS matches or surpasses LLM baselines across three simulation datasets while being three orders of magnitude smaller.

Conclusion: Graph-based modeling offers a promising lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation, with better efficiency, interpretability and transparency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with
applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are
LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We
identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices
among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass
strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We
introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete
choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging
relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when
needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show
that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater
efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of
graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

### [3] [IG-Pruning: Input-Guided Block Pruning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02213)
*Kangyu Qiao,Shaolei Zhang,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IG-Pruning is an input-aware block-wise pruning method that dynamically selects layer masks at inference time to reduce computational costs of large language models, outperforming static depth pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing computational demands of LLMs, efficient inference is critical for practical deployment. Existing depth pruning methods use fixed block masks, leading to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and L0 optimization, (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without extensive training requirements.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods.

Conclusion: IG-Pruning is particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios due to its dynamic input-aware approach.

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

### [4] [Demo: Statistically Significant Results On Biases and Errors of LLMs Do Not Guarantee Generalizable Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02246)
*Jonathan Liu,Haoling Qiu,Jonathan Lasko,Damianos Karakos,Mahsa Yarmohammadi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops an infrastructure to automatically generate and evaluate medical chatbot queries, revealing low inter-LLM agreement and recommending multiple evaluators for reliable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when medical chatbots fail due to non-medical factors like demographics, given the prevalence of hallucinations, omissions, and biases in LLMs used in medical contexts.

Method: Created infrastructure with: 1) automated query generation pipeline sampling patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles; 2) evaluation pipeline using LLM-as-a-judge setups for hallucination/omission detection and treatment category analysis.

Result: Found low inter-LLM agreement (average Cohen's Kappa κ=0.118), with only specific LLM pairs showing statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races.

Conclusion: Recommend using multiple LLM evaluators to avoid non-generalizable results and publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency, especially without ground-truth data.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

### [5] [LTD-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models by Letting Them Draw](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02347)
*Liuhao Lin,Ke Li,Zihan Xu,Yuchen Shi,Yulei Qin,Yan Zhang,Xing Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTD-Bench introduces a visual evaluation benchmark that transforms LLM assessment from abstract scores to observable drawings, revealing critical spatial reasoning limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation relies on opaque numerical metrics that conceal fundamental spatial reasoning limitations and create a dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities for real-world applications.

Method: LTD-Bench uses visual outputs through dot matrices or executable code generation, with complementary generation tasks (spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (spatial perception) across three difficulty levels to evaluate bidirectional language-spatial mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal an alarming capability gap - even state-of-the-art LLMs performing well on traditional benchmarks show profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional mappings between language and spatial concepts.

Conclusion: The visual outputs of LTD-Bench enable powerful diagnostic analysis and expose fundamental limitations in LLMs' ability to serve as genuine world models, bridging the gap between statistical performance and intuitive assessment.

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

### [6] [Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358)
*Wongyu Kim,Hochang Lee,Sanghak Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Solomon is a universal multimodal embedder that adaptively determines when to augment queries, improving performance while reducing embedding latency compared to always-augmenting approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based embedders augment every query, leading to substantial embedding latency and potential performance degradation for some queries. Previous methods also haven't been explored in multimodal environments.

Method: Divides training queries into augmentation-required and no-augmentation groups, generates appropriate augmentations using MLLM, and implements adaptive query augmentation where M-Solomon learns to generate /augment prefix for queries needing augmentation and /embed for others.

Result: M-Solomon surpassed baseline without augmentation by a large margin and outperformed baseline that always used augmentation, while providing much faster embedding latency.

Conclusion: Adaptive query augmentation is effective for improving retrieval performance while maintaining efficiency, and M-Solomon successfully addresses limitations of always-augmenting approaches in multimodal environments.

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

Result: Evaluated 18 LLMs in the current version (v251030), providing a comprehensive landscape of AI safety in Chinese language contexts. The benchmark is publicly accessible via a leaderboard.

Conclusion: LiveSecBench establishes a robust framework for continuously monitoring and improving the safety of Chinese-language LLMs while adapting to evolving security challenges.

Abstract: In this work, we propose LiveSecBench, a dynamic and continuously updated
safety benchmark specifically for Chinese-language LLM application scenarios.
LiveSecBench evaluates models across six critical dimensions (Legality, Ethics,
Factuality, Privacy, Adversarial Robustness, and Reasoning Safety) rooted in
the Chinese legal and social frameworks. This benchmark maintains relevance
through a dynamic update schedule that incorporates new threat vectors, such as
the planned inclusion of Text-to-Image Generation Safety and Agentic Safety in
the next update. For now, LiveSecBench (v251030) has evaluated 18 LLMs,
providing a landscape of AI safety in the context of Chinese language. The

### [8] [AyurParam: A State-of-the-Art Bilingual Language Model for Ayurveda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02374)
*Mohd Nauman,Sravan Gvm,Vijay Devane,Shyam Pawar,Viraj Thakur,Kundeshwar Pundalik,Piyush Sawarkar,Rohit Saluja,Maunendra Desarkar,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AyurParam-2.9B is a specialized bilingual language model for Ayurveda that outperforms larger models in traditional medical knowledge, demonstrating the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream LLMs underperform in specialized domains like Ayurveda that require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise from centuries of traditional medical knowledge.

Method: Fine-tuned Param-1-2.9B using an extensive, expertly curated Ayurveda dataset with context-aware reasoning and objective-style Q&A in English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation for factual precision.

Result: Surpasses all open-source instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5-3B parameters) and shows competitive or superior performance compared to much larger models on BhashaBench-Ayur benchmark.

Conclusion: Authentic domain adaptation and high-quality supervision are essential for delivering reliable, culturally congruent AI in specialized medical knowledge domains.

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

### [9] [AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376)
*Aashray Reddy,Andrew Zagula,Nicholas Saban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAdv is a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on LLMs, showing current safety mechanisms are vulnerable to adaptive multi-turn attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations focus on single-turn interactions, but real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations, creating a gap in understanding multi-turn vulnerabilities.

Method: AutoAdv combines three adaptive mechanisms: pattern manager that learns from successful attacks, temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters, and two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them.

Result: Achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns (24% improvement over single-turn baselines), with consistent vulnerabilities found across commercial and open-source models including GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, and Mistral-7B.

Conclusion: Current alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

### [10] [Merging Continual Pretraining Models for Domain-Specialized LLMs: A Case Study in Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02451)
*Kentaro Ueda,François Portet,Hirohiko Suwa,Keiichi Yasumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic analysis of merging Continual Pre-training (CPT) experts for financial LLMs, showing that merging recovers lost general knowledge and enables emergent cross-domain skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in specialized domains like finance that require diverse skills (domain knowledge, math reasoning, multilingual processing), and merging CPT experts offers a practical alternative to costly multi-skill training.

Method: Created financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and Japanese; proposed three-stage evaluation (knowledge recovery, complementarity, emergence); assessed three merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark from 18 tasks across 8 datasets.

Result: Merging expert with base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT; merging experts improves performance and yields emergent cross-domain skills; Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is hyperparameter-sensitive, while TIES is more robust; model similarity correlates with merging success but emergent skills depend on more complex factors.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first foundational analysis of CPT model merging, providing a principled framework and clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing assets.

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing
assets.

### [11] [Prompting for Policy: Forecasting Macroeconomic Scenarios with Synthetic LLM Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02458)
*Giulia Iadisernia,Carolina Camassa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona-based prompting doesn't improve LLM macroeconomic forecasting accuracy; GPT-4o achieves similar performance to human experts without persona descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves LLM performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks compared to human experts.

Method: Used 2,368 economics personas from PersonaHub to prompt GPT-4o for ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarters (2013-2025), comparing against human experts and 100 baseline forecasts without personas.

Result: GPT-4o and human forecasters achieved remarkably similar accuracy; persona descriptions provided no measurable forecasting advantage; GPT-4o maintained competitive performance on out-of-sample data (2024-2025).

Conclusion: Persona prompts can be omitted without sacrificing accuracy; GPT-4o achieves competitive macroeconomic forecasting with relevant context data, though produces more homogeneous forecasts than human panels.

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

TL;DR: Smart-Hiring is an NLP pipeline that automatically extracts structured information from resumes and matches candidates with job descriptions using semantic similarity in a shared vector space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual resume screening is time-consuming, error-prone, and subject to human bias, creating a need for automated, data-driven hiring solutions.

Method: Combines document parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to encode resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space for similarity computation.

Result: Achieves competitive matching accuracy on real-world datasets while maintaining high interpretability and transparency in decision-making.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, practical NLP framework for recruitment analytics with potential for bias mitigation and large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes
for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and
subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural
Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract
structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match
candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document
parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to
capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics,
Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space
to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline
is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and
matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of
resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains,
demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The
system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of
interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces
a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines
promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and
large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Google Translate's accuracy and fluency by identifying and reducing lexical errors in medical and official COVID-19 related texts.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of 230 texts translated from English to Romanian using Google Translate, focusing on official COVID-19 documents from WHO and Gavi.

Result: Identification of specific lexical errors in machine translations of medical and official COVID-19 information.

Conclusion: The research provides insights for improving Google Translate's lexical selection and reducing errors in medical and official document translations.

Abstract: The research explores error analysis in the performance of translating by
Machine Translation from English into Romanian, and it focuses on lexical
errors found in texts which include official information, provided by the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Organization, by the patient information
leaflet (the information about the active ingredients of the vaccines or the
medication, the indications, the dosage instructions, the storage instructions,
the side effects and warning, etc.). All of these texts are related to Covid-19
and have been translated by Google Translate, a multilingual Machine
Translation that was created by Google. In the last decades, Google has
actively worked to develop a more accurate and fluent automatic translation
system. This research, specifically focused on improving Google Translate, aims
to enhance the overall quality of Machine Translation by achieving better
lexical selection and by reducing errors. The investigation involves a
comprehensive analysis of 230 texts that have been translated from English into
Romanian.

*Max Norris,Kobi Gal,Sahan Bulathwela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NTKT reframes Knowledge Tracing as next-token prediction using LLMs, incorporating question text to improve performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT models overlook question text, missing pedagogical insights and limiting predictive performance, creating a need to leverage both student behavior and language patterns.

Method: Proposes NTKT that represents student histories and question content as text sequences, using pretrained LLMs for next-token prediction to learn from both behavior and language patterns.

Result: Significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and shows better generalization to cold-start questions and users.

Conclusion: Question content is crucial for KT, and leveraging pretrained LLM representations effectively models student learning by combining behavioral and linguistic patterns.

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

TL;DR: CGES is a Bayesian framework that uses confidence signals to adaptively stop LLM sampling when a candidate answer's posterior probability exceeds a threshold, reducing model calls by ~69% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency requires fixed multiple LLM calls and fails when correct answers are rare, needing a more efficient adaptive stopping method.

Method: Bayesian framework using confidence signals from token probabilities or reward models to form posteriors over answers and stop sampling adaptively when posterior threshold is met.

Result: Reduces average model calls by 69% (e.g., from 16.0 to 4.9) while matching self-consistency accuracy within 0.06 percentage points across five reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: CGES provides an efficient alternative to self-consistency with theoretical guarantees and significant computational savings while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

### [16] [The Realignment Problem: When Right becomes Wrong in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02623)
*Aakash Sen Sharma,Debdeep Sanyal,Vivek Srivastava,Shirish Karande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for dynamic LLM alignment that enables precise policy updates through programmatic triage and hybrid optimization, addressing the Alignment-Reality Gap without degrading model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods produce static, brittle models that fail to adapt to evolving human values and policies, creating an Alignment-Reality Gap that makes long-term deployment unreliable and costly.

Method: TRACE programmatically triages existing preference data against new policies, identifies conflicts using an alignment impact score, and applies hybrid optimization to invert, discard, or preserve preferences while maintaining model performance.

Result: TRACE achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B) on synthetic benchmarks and PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, enforcing new principles without degrading general capabilities.

Conclusion: TRACE establishes a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

### [17] [Understanding New-Knowledge-Induced Factual Hallucinations in LLMs: Analysis, Solution, and Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02626)
*Renfei Dang,Peng Hu,Changjiang Gao,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with new knowledge causes factual hallucinations, particularly when specific knowledge types are entirely unfamiliar. The proposed KnownPatch method mitigates this by adding known knowledge samples during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed that introducing new knowledge during LLM fine-tuning causes factual hallucinations, but lacked deep investigation into specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms.

Method: Created controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, conducted fine-grained analysis across knowledge types and tasks (QA and reasoning), and proposed KnownPatch method that patches known knowledge samples in later training stages.

Result: Fine-tuning with entirely new knowledge types significantly increases hallucination tendencies, which can affect other knowledge types in QA tasks. KnownPatch effectively alleviates hallucinations and improves performance by restoring attention to key entities.

Conclusion: High unfamiliarity of specific knowledge types drives hallucinations more than overall new knowledge proportion. KnownPatch successfully mitigates hallucinations by addressing attention disruption to key entities caused by new knowledge learning.

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes optimal singular damage method for efficient storage of fine-tuned LLMs by selectively sparsifying low-rank approximated parameter updates, achieving better accuracy within same memory budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are too big for most applications to store, and even fine-tuned versions remain storage-intensive. Recent findings show fine-tuning affects only a small fraction of parameters, highlighting need for efficient storage of parameter updates.

Method: Leverages observation that fine-tuning updates are low-rank and sparse. Proposes optimal singular damage method that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates by considering interleaved importance of singular vectors to retain most impactful components.

Result: Extensive experiments show proposed methods achieve significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within same memory budget compared to using low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Conclusion: The optimal singular damage method effectively addresses storage challenges of fine-tuned LLMs by combining low-rank approximation with selective sparsification, outperforming individual approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

TL;DR: PragExTra is the first multilingual corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation in translation, covering 8 language pairs with entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To computationally model pragmatic explicitation, a phenomenon where translators add background details to make implicit cultural meanings explicit, which has been widely discussed in translation theory but rarely modeled computationally.

Method: Built PragExTra corpus from TED-Multi and Europarl, identified candidate explicitation cases through null alignments, and used active learning with human annotation to refine detection.

Result: Entity and system-level explicitations are most frequent; active learning improved classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88 accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages.

Conclusion: PragExTra establishes pragmatic explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and advances culturally aware machine translation.

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Low-resource language countries have 20% lower AI adoption due to poor LLM performance in their languages, creating linguistic barriers to equitable AI diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why AI adoption is uneven globally, specifically testing if poor LLM performance in low-resource languages reduces AI utility and slows adoption in LRLCs.

Method: Used weighted regression model to isolate language effects from socioeconomic and demographic factors on AI adoption patterns.

Result: LRLCs have approximately 20% lower share of AI users relative to their baseline, indicating linguistic accessibility is a significant barrier.

Conclusion: Linguistic accessibility is an independent and significant barrier to equitable AI diffusion globally, requiring attention to bridge the adoption gap.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoRL is a centralized reinforcement learning framework that optimizes multi-LLM systems for performance-cost trade-off, enabling adaptive behavior under different budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized multi-LLM frameworks incur high and uncontrolled inference costs by invoking multiple models for every input, while different LLMs have complementary strengths and varying costs.

Method: A centralized framework with a controller LLM that selectively coordinates expert models using reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing inference costs in a controllable multi-budget setting.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show CoRL surpasses the best expert LLM under high-budget settings while maintaining strong performance in low-budget modes.

Conclusion: Centralized coordination enables scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems that can adapt to different budget conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

*Hung-Ting Chen,Xiang Liu,Shauli Ravfogel,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMER is a new retriever architecture that generates multiple query vectors autoregressively to capture multimodal document distributions, outperforming single-embedding retrievers by 4x on synthetic data and 4-21% on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text retrievers use only one query vector, which struggles when the conditional distribution of relevant documents is multimodal (e.g., different query interpretations). These retrievers perform worse as the distance between target document embeddings increases.

Method: Developed AMER (Autoregressive Multi-Embedding Retriever) that autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, with all predicted vectors used to retrieve documents from the corpus.

Result: On synthetic vectorized data: 4x better performance than single-embedding models. On real-world multi-answer retrieval datasets: 4% and 21% relative gains over single-embedding baselines. Larger gains observed when target document embeddings are less similar.

Conclusion: The multi-query vector retriever approach shows significant potential and opens up a new direction for future work in document retrieval.

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

*Qianhao Yuan,Jie Lou,Zichao Li,Jiawei Chen,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Le Sun,Debing Zhang,Xianpei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemSearcher is a search agent workflow that maintains compact memory across multi-turn interactions to balance information integrity and efficiency, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search agents face a trade-off between using full interaction history (high computation/memory costs) or only current turn (loss of essential information), limiting scalability.

Method: Proposes MemSearcher with iterative memory maintenance and multi-context GRPO RL framework to jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management.

Result: Achieves +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains across seven benchmarks; 3B-based MemSearcher outperforms 7B-based baselines.

Conclusion: Balancing information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead, demonstrating the effectiveness of the memory management approach.

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and
lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at

*Amanda Bertsch,Adithya Pratapa,Teruko Mitamura,Graham Neubig,Matthew R. Gormley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Oolong, a benchmark for evaluating long-context reasoning that requires analyzing individual text chunks and aggregating them to answer distributional questions, unlike existing benchmarks that mainly test retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-context evaluations primarily test retrieval from context sections, allowing models to disregard most context tokens as noise. This represents only one type of long-context task, leaving a gap for reasoning tasks that require analyzing and aggregating information across the entire context.

Method: Created Oolong benchmark with two task sets: Oolong-synth (naturalistic synthetic tasks for easy ablation studies) and Oolong-real (downstream reasoning over real-world conversational data). Tasks require models to reason over large quantities of examples, perform classification and counting in-context, and reason over temporal and user relations.

Result: Even frontier models struggle significantly, with GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy on both splits at 128K context length.

Conclusion: Current models have limited ability to perform complex reasoning over long contexts. The benchmark and evaluation harness are released to facilitate development of models that can effectively reason over large quantities of text.

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA is a Vision-Language-Action model with three key innovations: latent action modeling from manipulation videos, dual-level action representation for joint VLM-action supervision, and mixed training combining robot data with QA datasets to enhance 3D perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more capable VLA model that can effectively bridge language, vision, and action spaces for robotic manipulation tasks by addressing the challenge of aligning these different modalities.

Method: Uses a dual-level action representation framework with latent actions (high-level intentions) and structured discrete action tokens (low-level dynamics), trained on large-scale manipulation videos and mixed datasets including robot trajectories, general QA, and spatial QA data.

Result: Achieves superior performance on LIBERO Franka benchmark and competitive success rates in real-world manipulation tasks across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully aligns language, vision, and action representations, enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation, with plans to open-source portions of the self-constructed dataset for community research.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of foundation models in fetal ultrasound imaging under low inter-class variability, focusing on similar fetal brain standard planes (TT, TV, TC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like DINOv3 show transferability in medical domains, but their ability to discriminate anatomically similar structures hasn't been systematically investigated, especially for fetal brain ultrasound planes with overlapping features.

Method: Curated all public fetal ultrasound datasets into FetalUS-188K benchmark (188K+ images). DINOv3 pretrained self-supervised for ultrasound-aware representations, evaluated via linear probing and fine-tuning with two initialization schemes: pretraining on FetalUS-188K vs natural-image DINOv3 weights.

Result: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed natural-image initialized models, with up to 20% F1-score improvement. Domain-adaptive pretraining preserved subtle echogenic cues for distinguishing intermediate planes.

Conclusion: Generic foundation models fail to generalize under low inter-class variability; domain-specific pretraining is essential for robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [27] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) show competitive performance for flood inundation mapping across different satellite sensors, with Clay model demonstrating superior results in accuracy, computational efficiency, and few-shot learning compared to traditional U-Net and other GFMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is uncertainty about whether GFMs actually outperform traditional models like U-Net for flood mapping, and a systematic comparison across different sensors and data availability scenarios is lacking, which is crucial for guiding end-users in model selection.

Method: Evaluated three GFMs (Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA) and UViT against traditional models (TransNorm, U-Net, Attention U-Net) using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data. Conducted leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions and 19 sites, plus few-shot experiments with limited training data.

Result: GFMs show competitive performance with only 2-5% variation between best and worst models. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). Clay shows 4% improvement over U-Net and superior few-shot performance (0.64 mIoU with just 5 images vs 0.24 for Prithvi). Clay is computationally efficient with 26M parameters, making it 3x faster than Prithvi.

Conclusion: GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net, with Clay emerging as the most balanced choice considering accuracy, efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based method for image reconstruction from incomplete measurements that exploits multiple invariances to achieve full-supervised performance with less ground truth data, validated on photoacoustic microscopy upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address image reconstruction from incomplete measurements (upsampling/inpainting) with fixed deterministic sampling patterns that have inherently incomplete coverage, overcoming limitations of conventional supervised and self-supervised methods.

Method: Exploits multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution to theoretically achieve same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches, applied to optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy.

Result: Demonstrates competitive or superior reconstruction results while requiring substantially less ground truth data compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully overcomes limitations of fixed deterministic sampling patterns and achieves full-supervised performance with reduced ground truth requirements, validated on photoacoustic microscopy applications.

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking LMMs for PHI detection in medical imaging shows superior OCR performance but inconsistent overall accuracy improvements, with best gains on complex patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PHI detection methods using OCR and named entity recognition need improvement; LMMs offer potential for enhanced text extraction and semantic analysis in medical imaging.

Method: Systematically benchmarked GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B using two pipeline configurations: text analysis only and OCR+semantic analysis integration.

Result: LMMs showed superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) vs EasyOCR, but OCR improvement didn't consistently translate to better PHI detection accuracy. Best gains on complex imprint patterns.

Conclusion: LMM selection should consider operational constraints; proposed deployment strategy uses scalable modular infrastructure for PHI detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing strength-demanding activities using wearable IMU sensors for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power.

Method: Collected data from 29 healthy subjects using 10 IMUs placed on limbs and torso, annotated using video recordings as references, and conducted comparative analysis between IMU-estimated joint angles and video-extracted angles.

Result: Created a comprehensive dataset with technical validation showing accurate and reliable sensor data through joint angle comparison between IMUs and video.

Conclusion: StrengthSense enables researchers to advance human activity recognition algorithms and develop fitness/health monitoring applications.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for text-VQA datasets is tedious and challenging; there's a need for automated pipelines that can leverage foundation models and mature OCR systems to scale up dataset creation.

Method: Uses a multi-component pipeline involving OCR detection/recognition (text spotting), ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation models, streamlined to automate QA pair synthesis and validation.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively automates text-VQA dataset creation, scales with scene text data availability, and demonstrates the feasibility of automated large-scale dataset synthesis using modern vision-language models.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

TL;DR: A depth-only, markerless AR registration pipeline for HoloLens 2 achieved ~3-4 mm median error in live surgical settings on small/low-curvature anatomies without fiducials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and clinically evaluate a markerless AR registration pipeline for surgical guidance that works on small or low-curvature anatomies in real operative settings without requiring fiducial markers.

Method: Used HoloLens 2 with AHAT depth tracking aligned to CT skin meshes via depth-bias correction, human-in-the-loop initialization, and global+local registration. Validated with AR-tracked tools on leg/foot models, then performed 7 intraoperative trials during fibula free-flap harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery.

Result: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement (leg: 0.78 mm median error, feet: 0.80 mm). Clinical trials achieved median errors of 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm coverage rates of 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86% respectively.

Conclusion: The depth-only markerless AR pipeline achieved clinically relevant accuracy (~3-4 mm median error) approaching typical thresholds for moderate-risk surgical tasks, improving clinical readiness of markerless AR guidance.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated pipeline for 3D growth trajectory reconstruction of planktonic foraminifera using instance segmentation and chamber ordering algorithms from CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of foraminifera chambers is time-consuming and subjective, limiting large-scale ecological studies. Automated methods are needed to understand organismal development under changing environments.

Method: End-to-end pipeline combining instance segmentation (computer vision) with dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to reconstruct 3D growth trajectories from high-resolution CT scans.

Result: Pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust even with partial segmentation, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories.

Conclusion: First fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded PCA and RPCA framework for accurate crack width measurement from digital images, overcoming challenges of complex crack morphology and enabling rapid measurements from arbitrary pixel locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pavement crack width quantification is crucial for structural assessment and maintenance, but current methods struggle with complex crack boundaries and lack rapid measurement capabilities from arbitrary locations.

Method: Three-stage cascaded framework: (1) initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms, (2) PCA for determining primary orientation axis of quasi-parallel cracks, (3) RPCA for extracting Main Propagation Axis of irregular crack geometries.

Result: Superior performance in computational efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques across three publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed PCA-RPCA framework effectively addresses limitations of conventional approaches for crack width measurement, providing both accuracy and efficiency for comprehensive pavement condition evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

TL;DR: Autonomous bias tuning mechanism for event cameras that reduces flicker effects across 25-500 Hz range using CNN-based detection and dynamic bias adjustment, improving face detection performance in various lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address flicker effects caused by rapid light intensity variations in event cameras without relying on additional hardware or software filters, leveraging the cameras' inherent bias settings for more efficient mitigation.

Method: Uses a simple CNN to identify flicker instances in spatial space and dynamically adjusts specific camera biases to minimize flicker impact. Tested with face detector framework under well-lit and low-light conditions across various frequencies.

Result: Significant improvements: enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, increased percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Average gradient (flicker indicator) decreased by 38.2% in well-lit and 53.6% in low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates significant potential to improve event camera functionality in adverse lighting scenarios by autonomously mitigating flicker effects through bias tuning.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Motivation: To address the GVQA task's need for robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning, visual grounding, and temporal object tracking.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: Video Reasoning & QA, Spatio-temporal Grounding, and Tracking, using trigger moments from CORTEX prompts to identify the most visible object frames.

Result: Achieved HOTA score of 0.4968, significantly improving over previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with trigger moments effectively enhances object grounding and tracking performance in video question answering.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

TL;DR: MM-UNet is a novel deep learning architecture for retinal vessel segmentation that uses Morph Mamba Convolution layers and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules to improve segmentation of thin, branching vascular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis but challenging due to the extremely thin and branching nature of retinal vasculature, which differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets and poses challenges to precision and robustness.

Method: Proposed MM-UNet with Morph Mamba Convolution layers that replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception, and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules that integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness.

Result: Achieves F1-score gains of 1.64% on DRIVE and 1.25% on STARE datasets compared to existing approaches, demonstrating superior segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: MM-UNet effectively addresses the challenges of retinal vessel segmentation through its novel architecture components and shows significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

TL;DR: Language-enhanced generative model synthesizes Abeta-PET images from blood biomarkers and MRI, enabling accurate Alzheimer's diagnosis without expensive PET scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis relies on expensive and inaccessible Abeta-PET imaging. This study aims to predict PET spatial patterns from more accessible blood biomarkers and MRI scans.

Method: Collected data from 566 participants (Abeta-PET, MRI, blood biomarkers). Developed LLM-driven multimodal fusion model to synthesize PET images. Evaluated synthetic images for quality, diagnostic consistency, and clinical applicability in automated diagnostic pipeline.

Result: Synthetic PET closely resembles real PET (SSIM=0.920, Pearson's r=0.955). High diagnostic agreement with real PET (accuracy=0.80). Synthetic PET-based model (AUC=0.78) outperforms MRI-only (0.68) and biomarker-only (0.73) models. Combined synthetic PET+biomarkers achieved AUC=0.79.

Conclusion: Language-enhanced generative model successfully synthesizes realistic PET images, improving Alzheimer's diagnostic workflow by leveraging more accessible MRI and blood biomarkers.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

TL;DR: A novel object-centric 3D reconstruction framework using SAM-2 and alpha channel masking for clean strawberry plant reconstructions, enabling automatic plant trait estimation with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming and destructive, while current 3DGS applications reconstruct entire scenes including background noise, complicating trait analysis and increasing computational costs.

Method: Proposed an object-centric 3D reconstruction framework with preprocessing pipeline using Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean plant reconstructions, followed by DBSCAN clustering and PCA for automatic trait estimation.

Result: The method produces more accurate geometric representations with substantially reduced computational time, outperforming conventional pipelines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry plant phenotyping, enabling automatic estimation of important plant traits like height and canopy width.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces autoStrain, the first automated pipeline for segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) estimation in transesophageal echocardiography using deep learning methods, comparing two approaches (TeeFlow and TeeTracker) and demonstrating clinical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current strain estimation techniques require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes. There's a need for automated solutions to enhance cardiac function assessment.

Method: Used a simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to generate realistic synthetic TEE data with ground truth myocardial motion. Compared two deep learning approaches: TeeFlow (based on RAFT optical flow) and TeeTracker (based on CoTracker point trajectory model).

Result: TeeTracker outperformed TeeFlow with mean distance error of 0.65 mm on synthetic test data. Clinical validation on 16 patients showed SLS estimation aligned with clinical references (mean difference 1.09%, limits of agreement -8.90% to 11.09%). Simulated ischemia improved accuracy in quantifying abnormal deformation.

Conclusion: AI-driven motion estimation integrated with TEE can significantly enhance precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the

*Yiqin Zhao,Tian Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models can significantly improve mobile sparse sensing by enabling more accurate geometry-aware image warping and leading to better 3D scene reconstruction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile sensing systems face a fundamental trade-off between sensing quality and efficiency due to computational and power constraints. Existing sparse sensing methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to missing information across space and time.

Method: The study investigates using foundation models for mobile sparse sensing, evaluating their performance on real-world mobile AR data, particularly focusing on geometry-aware image warping techniques.

Result: Foundation models offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping and demonstrate leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction, showing scalability for mobile sparse sensing applications.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for transforming mobile sparse sensing systems but also present open challenges that need to be addressed for effective integration.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

### [42] [Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion of MRI and PET for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02228)
*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a collaborative attention and consistency-guided fusion framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using MRI and PET neuroimaging, addressing modality-specific feature importance and distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early Alzheimer's diagnosis is crucial, but existing multimodal fusion methods overlook modality-specific features and suffer from distributional differences between MRI and PET data, leading to biased representations.

Method: Uses learnable parameter representation block for missing modality compensation, shared and modality-independent encoders for preserving both shared and specific features, and consistency-guided mechanism for latent distribution alignment.

Result: Experimental results on ADNI dataset show superior diagnostic performance compared to existing fusion strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses modality-specific feature importance and distribution alignment challenges in multimodal neuroimaging for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

TL;DR: Latent feature alignment method for monocular depth estimation in endoscopic videos that reduces domain gap between synthetic and real images via adversarial learning and feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods still leave a domain gap between translated synthetic images and real endoscopic frames, limiting absolute depth estimation accuracy for medical robotics.

Method: Uses adversarial learning and directional feature consistency to learn domain-invariant latent features from both translated synthetic and real endoscopic frames.

Result: Achieves superior performance on both absolute and relative depth metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, with consistent improvements across various backbones and pretrained weights.

Conclusion: The proposed latent feature alignment method effectively reduces domain gap and improves monocular depth estimation for endoscopic videos, benefiting autonomous medical robotics applications.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

*Yucheng Song,Yifan Ge,Junhao Li,Zhining Liao,Zhifang Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTSC-CIF framework addresses three key challenges in Medical Report Generation through hierarchical task decomposition: low-level medical entity alignment, mid-level cross-modal alignment, and high-level causal intervention to reduce biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRG models face three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge, poor text-visual alignment, and spurious correlations from cross-modal biases. Previous work only addressed single challenges, while this paper aims to solve all three simultaneously.

Method: Proposes HTSC-CIF framework with hierarchical decomposition: 1) Low-level: align medical entities with spatial locations for domain knowledge; 2) Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling and Masked Image Modeling for cross-modal alignment; 3) High-level: cross-modal causal intervention via front-door intervention to reduce confounders.

Result: Extensive experiments show HTSC-CIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRG methods, demonstrating effectiveness across all three challenge areas.

Conclusion: The hierarchical task decomposition approach successfully addresses multiple challenges in MRG simultaneously, providing a comprehensive solution that improves domain knowledge, cross-modal alignment, and reduces spurious correlations.

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

### [45] [Are Euler angles a useful rotation parameterisation for pose estimation with Normalizing Flows?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02277)
*Giorgos Sfikas,Konstantina Nikolaidou,Foteini Papadopoulou,George Retsinas,Anastasios L. Kesidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Euler angles parameterization for probabilistic 3D object pose estimation with Normalizing Flows, arguing that despite their limitations, Euler angles can lead to useful models compared to more complex parameterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic pose estimation is beneficial when pose is ambiguous due to sensor constraints, projection limitations, or object symmetries. The authors want to investigate whether the simple Euler angles parameterization can be effective for probabilistic pose estimation models.

Method: The authors use Normalizing Flows models with Euler angles parameterization for 3D object pose estimation, comparing this approach against models built on more complex parameterizations.

Result: The paper finds that Euler angles, despite their known shortcomings, can lead to useful probabilistic pose estimation models in various aspects when used with Normalizing Flows.

Conclusion: Euler angles parameterization, while having limitations, can be effectively used for probabilistic 3D pose estimation with Normalizing Flows and may offer advantages over more complex parameterizations in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

TL;DR: SAIL-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances multimodal LLMs' reasoning by teaching them when and how to think through dual rewards for thinking quality and adaptive judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches suffer from outcome-only supervision that rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and uniform thinking strategies that cause overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones.

Method: Uses a dual reward system: Thinking Reward evaluates reasoning quality (factual grounding, logical coherence, answer consistency), and Judging Reward adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate.

Result: Improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieves competitive performance against GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: Establishes SAIL-RL as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive multimodal large language models.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Handwritten Mathematical Expression recognition by effectively modeling spatial dependencies and structure through graph-based representation.

Method: Uses BLSTM for symbol segmentation/recognition, 2D-CFG parser for spatial relations, and GNN link prediction to refine graph structure by removing unnecessary connections.

Result: Experimental results show promising performance in HME structure recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The GNN-based graph modeling approach combined with BLSTM and 2D-CFG parsing provides an effective solution for HME recognition by capturing spatial dependencies and refining structure.

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cycle-Sync is a robust global framework for camera pose estimation that uses modified message-passing least squares with cycle consistency and Welsch-type robust loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance without bundle adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust and global camera pose estimation framework that leverages cycle consistency for improved accuracy and avoids the computational burden of bundle adjustment.

Method: Adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) for camera location estimation, emphasizes cycle-consistent information, redefines cycle consistencies using estimated distances, incorporates Welsch-type robust loss, and adds outlier rejection via robust subspace recovery.

Result: Establishes strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, achieves lowest known sample complexity using only cycle consistency, and outperforms leading pose estimators including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync provides a robust, globally optimal camera pose estimation framework that eliminates the need for bundle adjustment while achieving superior performance through cycle consistency and robust optimization techniques.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

*Kun Zou,Yongheng Xu,Jianxing Yu,Yan Pan,Jian Yin,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAFD-CC is a post-hoc OOD detection method that performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights and fuses decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for robust OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods overlook the inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for effective OOD detection. They need to better refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance.

Method: Global-Aware Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC): 1) Performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights to extract positively correlated features (for ID/OOD boundary refinement) and negatively correlated features (to suppress false positives). 2) Adaptively fuses these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong generalization ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GAFD-CC effectively addresses the limitation of existing methods by leveraging the correlation between features and logits, achieving robust OOD detection through feature decoupling and confidence calibration.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Current portable physiological monitoring methods have accessibility limitations and reliability challenges. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones faces motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view constraints, with no widely available datasets for cross-device accuracy validation.

Method: Created M3PD dataset with synchronized dual-view videos (facial and fingertip) captured via front and rear smartphone cameras. Proposed F3Mamba model that fuses facial and fingertip views through Mamba-based temporal modeling for improved heart rate estimation.

Result: F3Mamba reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to 30.2 percent compared to existing single-view baselines. The model demonstrates improved robustness in challenging real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The dual-view approach with Mamba-based temporal modeling significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of smartphone-based photoplethysmography for cardiovascular monitoring, particularly benefiting patients who need accessible physiological monitoring.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa is a novel vision-language framework that uses continuous latent thought vectors for cross-modal reasoning, bridging the gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are constrained to discrete linguistic tokens, which bottlenecks the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception and limits reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses iterative reasoning cycle with Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) to refine latent thought vectors, dynamic token selection for salient regions, and multi-task training with contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction.

Result: Improves accuracy and token efficiency over baselines; 1.5B model competes with 7B-9B models, and 7B version remains competitive with SOTA. Latent space captures interpretable reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: CoCoVa successfully bridges the representational gap between discrete language and continuous visual understanding, demonstrating the potential of continuous reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Result: RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, with BIVP strategy significantly improving structural extraction quality while simplifying model design.

Conclusion: The method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised moving object segmentation for sparse radar point clouds using contrastive learning with cluster refinement to reduce annotation costs and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors provide direct Doppler velocity measurements for single-scan moving object segmentation, but radar point clouds are sparse and noisy, making supervised learning annotation tedious and expensive.

Method: Two-step approach: contrastive self-supervised representation learning with cluster refinement (dynamic points removal) followed by supervised fine-tuning with limited annotated data.

Result: Method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning and boosts state-of-the-art performance through self-supervised pretraining.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining enables effective moving object segmentation in sparse radar data with reduced annotation requirements.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

### [54] [A Novel Grouping-Based Hybrid Color Correction Algorithm for Color Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02397)
*Kuo-Liang Chung,Ting-Chung Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A grouping-based hybrid color correction algorithm for color point clouds that adaptively partitions points into proximity groups and applies different correction methods (KBI, JKHE, HE) based on overlapping rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color consistency correction is fundamental for 3D rendering and compression, but most existing methods focus on color images rather than point clouds.

Method: Estimates overlapping rate between source and target point clouds, partitions target points into proximity groups (Gcl, Gmod, Gdist), and applies K-nearest neighbors bilateral interpolation (KBI) for close points, joint KBI and histogram equalization (JKHE) for moderate points, and histogram equalization (HE) for distant points.

Result: Tested on 1086 color point cloud pairs and demonstrated superior color consistency correction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed grouping-based hybrid approach effectively corrects color consistency in point clouds with adaptive methods based on proximity, achieving better performance than existing solutions.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

Method: Used a unified frozen-encoder benchmark with layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple model architectures (CNNs, supervised ViTs, windowed transformers, self-supervised ViTs/DINO).

Result: DINO ViT-B/16 achieved the highest alignment (mean CKA-RBF ≈0.814, mean CKA-linear ≈0.745, mean RSA ≈0.698), with peak alignment at early blocks. Supervised ViTs showed weaker geometric correspondence despite competitive CKA scores.

Conclusion: Self-supervision combined with ViT inductive biases produces representational geometries that better align feline and human visual systems than CNNs and windowed transformers, providing neuroscientific insights about cross-species visual convergence.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

### [56] [IllumFlow: Illumination-Adaptive Low-Light Enhancement via Conditional Rectified Flow and Retinex Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02411)
*Wenyang Wei,Yang yang,Xixi Jia,Xiangchu Feng,Weiwei Wang,Renzhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IllumFlow combines conditional Rectified Flow with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement, separating illumination and reflectance components to handle lighting variations and noise effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low-light image enhancement, including wide illumination variations and complex noise, by leveraging the complementary strengths of Retinex theory and flow-based generative models.

Method: Decomposes images into reflectance and illumination components using Retinex theory, models illumination changes with conditional rectified flow as continuous flow fields, and uses a denoising network with flow-derived augmentation for reflectance noise removal.

Result: Superior quantitative and qualitative performance in low-light enhancement and exposure correction compared to existing methods, with precise illumination adaptation and customizable brightness enhancement.

Conclusion: IllumFlow provides an effective framework for low-light image enhancement by synergizing conditional rectified flow with Retinex theory, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining color fidelity and supporting flexible brightness control.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks in real-world applications.

Method: Multi-stage code-driven pipeline using RAG for chart templates and CoT for reasoning codes, generating diverse charts and statistical computations.

Result: Created ChartM³ dataset with 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs; SFT and RL experiments show improved reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The dataset enables smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger models in complex chart comprehension, advancing practical chart understanding.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models for crop-weed segmentation requires large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real agricultural fields. Synthetic data can help but faces the challenge of the simulation-to-reality gap.

Method: Developed a procedural generation pipeline using Blender to create synthetic crop-weed images with diverse conditions (plant growth, weed density, lighting, camera angles) and benchmarked state-of-the-art segmentation models on both synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Training on synthetic images achieved a 10% sim-to-real gap, surpassing previous methods. Synthetic data showed better generalization than real datasets in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: Synthetic agricultural datasets have strong potential and support hybrid training strategies for more efficient model development in agricultural robotics.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shotaro Tora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAFormer is a novel multi-view action recognition method for spatio-temporal action recognition (STAR) that uses transformer-based cooperation between views while preserving spatial information in feature maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multi-view action recognition methods focus on single action recognition from entire videos and are not applicable to STAR settings where each person's action is recognized sequentially. They lose spatial information in embedding vectors, making them ineffective for STAR.

Method: Proposes MVAFormer with a transformer-based cooperation module that uses feature maps instead of embedding vectors to preserve spatial information. The module divides self-attention for same and different views to effectively model relationships between multiple views.

Result: MVAFormer outperforms comparison baselines by approximately 4.4 points on F-measure in experiments using a newly collected dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches for STAR settings by preserving spatial information and effectively modeling multi-view relationships through specialized attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Motivation: To address the limitations of synthetic datasets and small-scale real-world datasets that restrict the realism and generalization of object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis, and relighting techniques.

Method: Captured 765 real-world objects using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, providing well-calibrated camera parameters, object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources.

Result: Created a comprehensive dataset with large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation.

Conclusion: OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data, and will be publicly released to advance research in this field.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next

TL;DR: A cross-view UAV localization framework using object detection and graph neural networks for accurate localization in GNSS-denied areas by matching UAV and satellite images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of UAV localization in GNSS-denied areas where satellite-based methods fail, and overcome limitations of existing approaches that suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism in cross-view image matching.

Method: Leverage modern object detection to extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, then integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships using a fine-grained graph-based node-similarity metric.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show strong retrieval and localization performance, effectively handling heterogeneous appearance differences and generalizing well to scenarios with larger modality gaps like infrared-visible image matching.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves robust cross-view UAV localization and demonstrates good generalization capabilities, making it applicable to various modality matching scenarios beyond the original satellite-UAV context.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available

TL;DR: UniChange is the first MLLM-based unified change detection model that integrates both binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) tasks using special tokens and text prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection models are limited to single-type annotated data and cannot leverage diverse datasets, leading to poor generalization and limited versatility. Multimodal Large Language Models offer new possibilities for unified change detection.

Method: UniChange leverages MLLMs' language priors and unification capabilities, introducing three special tokens ([T1], [T2], [CHANGE]) and using text prompts to guide change category identification, eliminating the need for predefined classification heads.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on four public benchmarks: WHU-CD (90.41 IoU), S2Looking (53.04 IoU), LEVIR-CD+ (78.87 IoU), and SECOND (57.62 IoU), surpassing all previous methods.

Conclusion: UniChange successfully unifies BCD and SCD tasks, effectively acquires knowledge from multi-source datasets even with conflicting class definitions, and demonstrates superior generalization capabilities through MLLM integration.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: PtychoBench benchmark shows task-dependent optimal specialization strategies: SFT+ICL for visual artifact detection, ICL alone for textual parameter recommendation in microscopy workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine optimal domain adaptation strategies for foundation models in specialized scientific microscopy tasks, as general-purpose models need specialization but the best approach is unclear.

Method: Created PtychoBench multi-modal benchmark to systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies for visual artifact detection (VLMs) and textual parameter recommendation (LLMs) in data-scarce conditions.

Result: For visual tasks: SFT+ICL achieved best performance (Micro-F1 0.728). For textual tasks: ICL alone was superior (Micro-F1 0.847), outperforming SFT models. Context-aware prompting was consistently better, and fine-tuned models showed contextual interference.

Conclusion: Optimal specialization strategy depends on task modality, providing a clear framework for developing effective science-based AI agentic systems.

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly that learns from reference videos' styles to automatically arrange shots according to narrative requirements while preserving artistic expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intelligent video editing technologies fail to capture creators' unique artistic expression in shot assembly, which is traditionally done manually by experienced editors.

Method: Visual-semantic matching between LLM-generated scripts and video library, shot segmentation and attribute extraction (size, motion, semantics), energy-based models to score sequences based on reference styles, and optimization with syntax rules.

Result: The system can automatically arrange shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles while learning assembly styles from reference videos to create coherent visual sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables even novice users to create visually compelling videos by automating shot assembly while preserving artistic expression learned from reference videos.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

Result: Frontier VLMs struggle with faithful SVG generation, revealing a gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. VCoder delivers 12.3-point overall gain over top-performing Claude-4-Opus, though limitations remain in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning.

Conclusion: SVG code shows promise as symbolic visual representation, with both humans and VLMs performing worse on rendered SVGs but maintaining consistency, indicating the potential of this approach for visual reasoning.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

TL;DR: Proposes a privacy-preserving automated report generation pipeline for mobile robotics using local models on edge devices, evaluated across diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for automated evaluation of AI-enabled mechatronic systems in critical applications like autonomous driving and service robotics, while preserving privacy and avoiding external services.

Method: Pipeline for generating natural language reports using multi-modal sensors, relying solely on local models deployable on edge computing devices.

Result: Evaluated on diverse dataset spanning indoor, outdoor and urban environments with quantitative and qualitative results; example reports available publicly.

Conclusion: Proposed pipeline enables privacy-preserving automated report generation for mobile robotics without external dependencies, facilitating system evaluation and acceptance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public
repository.

*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel is a self-tuning training pipeline for sparse-voxel rasterization that improves stability, reduces VRAM usage by 40-60%, and preserves low-frequency details while maintaining comparable performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of sparse-voxel rasterization including underfitting low-frequency content, dependency on brittle pruning heuristics, and VRAM overgrowth issues.

Method: Uses inverse-Sobel reweighting with mid-training gamma-ramp for low-frequency awareness, depth-quantile pruning with EMA-hysteresis guards, and ray-footprint-based priority-driven subdivision under explicit growth budget.

Result: Reduces peak VRAM by 40-60%, mitigates errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability, while maintaining comparable PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS to baseline SVRaster pipeline.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel enables more predictable, memory-efficient training without sacrificing perceptual quality, preserving low-frequency detail that prior methods miss.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

*Jessica Plassmann,Nicolas Schuler,Georg von Freymann,Michael Schuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in shearographic images, evaluating three architectures trained solely on defect-free data to reduce reliance on expert interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shearography's industrial adoption is limited by the need for expert interpretation. The study aims to reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation through unsupervised learning for automated anomaly detection.

Method: Three unsupervised architectures were evaluated: fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, and student-teacher feature matching model. All models were trained solely on defect-free data using a controlled dataset with reproducible defect patterns under both ideal and realistic deformation conditions.

Result: The student-teacher approach achieved superior classification robustness and enabled precise defect localization. It demonstrated improved separability of feature representations compared to autoencoder-based models, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial environments, with the student-teacher model showing particular promise for robust anomaly detection and localization.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

TL;DR: Deep learning models can predict future brain MRIs from baseline scans with high fidelity, enabling personalized prognosis for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict future brain states from baseline MRI scans, which is crucial for studying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, by forecasting entire brain MRIs years into the future rather than just cognitive scores.

Method: Implemented and evaluated five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL) for longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction.

Result: Best performing models achieved high-fidelity predictions, with all models generalizing well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

TL;DR: UVH-26 is the first large-scale Indian traffic camera dataset with 26,646 images and 1.8M bounding boxes across 14 vehicle classes, showing 8.4-31.5% performance improvements over COCO-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical gap in existing global benchmarks for Indian traffic scenarios by creating domain-specific training data that captures the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility.

Method: Collected 26,646 high-resolution images from 2800 Bengaluru CCTV cameras over 4 weeks, annotated through crowdsourced hackathon with 565 students, and derived consensus ground truth using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms.

Result: Models trained on UVH-26 achieved 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over COCO-trained baselines, with RT-DETR-X showing best performance at 0.67 mAP50:95 compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights.

Conclusion: UVH-26 demonstrates significant benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios and provides a foundation for advancing intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTF-CVReID is a parameter-efficient framework for cross-view video person ReID that introduces seven complementary modules over ViT-B/16 backbone, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies in cross-view video person ReID (e.g., aerial-ground surveillance).

Method: Seven modules: CSFN for camera/view bias correction, MRFH for scale stabilization, IAMM for identity reinforcement, TDM for temporal encoding, IVFA for perspective alignment, HTPL for multi-scale temporal learning, and MVICL for cross-view identity coherence via contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves SOTA on AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitudes with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS, adding only ~2M parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs while maintaining 189 FPS real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: Carefully designed adapter-based modules can substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without compromising computational efficiency.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCFlow is a subject-agnostic brain decoding framework that reconstructs visual experiences from fMRI using hierarchical modeling of visual cortex architecture, achieving fast reconstruction without subject-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable clinical applications by overcoming challenges in cross-subject generalization and complex brain signal processing for visual reconstruction from fMRI.

Method: Hierarchical framework modeling ventral-dorsal visual system architecture with feature-level contrastive learning to extract subject-invariant semantic representations.

Result: Achieves 7% accuracy sacrifice compared to conventional methods but generates reconstructed videos in 10 seconds without retraining, using significantly less data (vs. 12+ hours per subject).

Conclusion: VCFlow provides a fast, clinically scalable solution for subject-agnostic brain decoding with practical applications in medical settings.

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

*Daichi Nagai,Ryugo Morita,Shunsuke Kitada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE is a training-free framework for layer-wise image generation using Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC) to achieve semantic coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models produce flattened images, lacking layer-wise control needed for professional applications. Existing solutions require fine-tuning with large datasets or generate only isolated elements without complete scenes.

Method: Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC) extracts intermediate latent representations from foreground and composite generation processes and transplants them into initial noise for subsequent layers to ensure coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show training-free TAUE achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, maintaining high image quality and fidelity while enhancing layer-wise consistency.

Conclusion: TAUE eliminates costly training and dataset requirements, enables complex compositional editing, and paves the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks where malicious actors use spoofing techniques to gain illegitimate access to secure systems.

Method: Proposes a novel lightweight CNN framework for liveness detection that can identify various types of spoof attacks including print/display, video, and wrap attacks.

Result: The architecture provides seamless liveness detection with fast biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU) and is validated on a newly created 2D spoof attack dataset with 500+ videos from 60 subjects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects presentation attacks and ensures secure biometric authentication, with demonstration available showing successful detection of various attack types.

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack

TL;DR: UniPruneBench is a unified benchmark for evaluating visual token pruning methods in multimodal LLMs, revealing that random pruning is surprisingly effective and no single method consistently outperforms others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models suffer from severe inference inefficiency due to excessive visual tokens, and existing token compression methods lack consistent evaluation standards.

Method: Developed UniPruneBench with standardized protocols across 6 ability dimensions and 10 datasets, evaluating 10 compression algorithms on 3 LMM families (LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, Qwen2.5-VL) with both accuracy and system-level metrics.

Result: Key findings: random pruning is strong baseline, no single method consistently outperforms others, OCR tasks are most vulnerable to pruning, and pruning ratio is the dominant performance factor.

Conclusion: UniPruneBench provides a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling and highlights the need for scenario-specific pruning strategies.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel VI-ReID framework using Modality-Transition Representation Learning with middle generated images as transmitters between visible and infrared modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the substantial modality gap between visible and infrared images in person re-identification, and overcome limitations of existing methods that rely on intermediate representations with poor interpretability and parameter efficiency.

Method: Uses modality-transition representation learning with middle generated images as transmitters, trained with modality-transition contrastive loss and modality-query regularization loss for effective cross-modal feature alignment.

Result: Significantly and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three typical VI-ReID datasets while maintaining the same inference speed as the backbone network.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the visible-infrared modality gap without additional parameters, achieving superior performance in VI-ReID tasks with improved interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VidEmo framework for video emotion understanding using affective cues-guided reasoning and a 2.1M instruction dataset, achieving SOTA on 15 face perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotions are dynamic and cues-dependent, making complex emotional states difficult to understand with rationale. Current VideoLLMs need better emotion reasoning capabilities.

Method: Affective cues-guided reasoning framework with VidEmo foundation models, using curriculum emotion learning and affective-tree reinforcement learning in two-stage tuning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance and sets new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses video emotion understanding challenges through staged reasoning and large-scale emotion-centric data.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

*Vojtěch Kůr,Adam Bajger,Adam Kukučka,Marek Hradil,Vít Musil,Tomáš Brázdil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLEXICORP automates concept naming and explanation generation in CNNs by combining concept relevance propagation with multimodal large language models, making AI explanations more accessible and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept relevance propagation workflows require manual inspection and explanation synthesis by experts, limiting accessibility and scalability of AI explanations.

Method: A modular pipeline that couples concept relevance propagation with a multimodal large language model to automatically assign descriptive names to concept prototypes and generate natural-language explanations from relevance distributions.

Result: The method successfully generates tailored explanations for different audiences and qualitatively works well on ImageNet images with VGG16 model.

Conclusion: Integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks and enable more transparent AI systems.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

*Tyler Zhu,Tengda Han,Leonidas Guibas,Viorica Pătrăucean,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, revealing that cross-modal alignment depends on visual and text data richness, and shows correlation between semantic alignment and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While image-text alignment has been well studied, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in cross-modal representation alignment research.

Method: The authors conduct systematic experiments probing video and language encoders, propose parametric test-time scaling laws, and investigate correlations between semantic alignment and downstream task performance.

Result: Findings show cross-modal alignment highly depends on data richness, with proposed scaling laws demonstrating strong predictive power. Strong alignment correlates with general-purpose video representation and temporal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Video-text alignment serves as an informative zero-shot way to probe representation power of encoders for spatio-temporal data, providing insights into structural similarities and downstream capabilities.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

*Antonio Oroz,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PercHead is a unified method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing using perceptual supervision from DINOv2 and SAM2.1, achieving state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis and enabling intuitive geometry and appearance editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in single-image 3D head reconstruction including severe view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and ambiguity in 3D editing tasks.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoder with ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features to 3D via iterative cross-attention, rendered with Gaussian Splatting. Employs perceptual supervision from DINOv2 and SAM2.1. For editing, swaps encoder and finetunes network with geometry controlled by segmentation maps and appearance by text/image prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis with exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles. Enables intuitive 3D editing through interactive GUI for geometry sculpting and appearance stylization.

Conclusion: PercHead provides a unified framework for high-quality 3D head reconstruction and semantic editing, demonstrating strong performance and user-friendly editing capabilities.

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

### [86] [When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779)
*Yiyang Zhou,Haoqin Tu,Zijun Wang,Zeyu Wang,Niklas Muennighoff,Fan Nie,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Chaorui Deng,Shen Yan,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie,Huaxiu Yao,Qinghao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA is a benchmark for evaluating models that require generating intermediate visual images (sketches, diagrams) for reasoning, unlike traditional text-only CoT methods. It includes 546 multimodal problems and shows models perform poorly with text-only prompts but improve significantly (33.7% gain) when visual cues are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of text-only reasoning methods by creating scenarios where generating intermediate visual images is essential, mirroring human "drawing to think" problem-solving approaches.

Method: Created MIRA benchmark with 546 multimodal problems requiring intermediate image generation. Uses three evaluation levels: direct input, text-only CoT, and Visual-CoT with annotated image clues. Evaluates using pass@k and majority voting accuracies.

Result: Existing multimodal models perform poorly with text-only prompts but show 33.7% average improvement when intermediate visual cues are provided. Textual prompt expansions yield only limited improvements compared to Visual-CoT.

Conclusion: Visual information is critical for successful reasoning on complex tasks, highlighting the importance of intermediate visual generation in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate AI-generated media forensic methods, addressing gaps in standardized benchmarks, inconsistent training protocols, and limited evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated media threats like deepfakes are eroding public trust and increasing fraud, while existing forensic methods suffer from non-standardized benchmarks, inconsistent training protocols, and limited evaluation metrics that hinder fair comparison and deployment.

Method: Developed a unified benchmarking framework to evaluate ten state-of-the-art forensic methods (scratch, frozen, fine-tuned) across seven publicly available datasets (GAN and diffusion) using multiple metrics including accuracy, average precision, ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity, plus interpretability analysis with confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps.

Result: Evaluations revealed substantial variability in generalization, with some methods showing strong in-distribution performance but poor cross-model transferability, highlighting the limitations of current approaches.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for developing more robust, generalizable, and explainable forensic solutions by establishing standardized evaluation protocols and revealing the strengths and limitations of current methods.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build on progress in pathology foundation models by creating scalable architectures that can handle diverse histopathology tasks with improved efficiency and performance.

Method: Two ViT architectures: PLUTO-4S uses FlexiViT with 2D-RoPE embeddings for multi-scale deployment, while PLUTO-4G uses single patch size for maximum capacity. Both pretrained with DINOv2 self-supervised objective on 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across 50+ institutions.

Conclusion: PLUTO-4 demonstrates strong potential as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic applications, with PLUTO-4S providing practical deployment efficiency and PLUTO-4G establishing new performance frontiers in pathology AI.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world

TL;DR: DenseMarks is a learned 3D embedding representation for human heads that enables high-quality dense correspondences across diverse head images using a canonical 3D unit cube space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust dense correspondences for human head images that work across different poses, individuals, and cover the entire head including hair, while being interpretable and queryable.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer to predict 3D embeddings per pixel mapped to a canonical unit cube. Trained with contrastive loss on pairwise point matches from talking head videos, plus multi-task learning with face landmarks, segmentation constraints, and spatial continuity through latent cube features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. Robust to pose variations and covers entire head including hair.

Conclusion: DenseMarks provides an effective learned representation for human head analysis that enables various applications like semantic part matching, tracking, and stereo reconstruction through its canonical 3D embedding space.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

TL;DR: VRF-Net is a hybrid deep learning framework combining Vision Transformer and residual networks for high-resolution system matrix recovery in Magnetic Particle Imaging, achieving superior performance across multiple scales compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) resolution suffers from downsampling and coil sensitivity variations, requiring improved system matrix recovery methods to enhance image quality.

Method: Combines transformer-based global attention with residual convolutional refinement, using dual-stage downsampling for realistic degradation and trained on Open MPI and simulated datasets with variable coil sensitivity profiles.

Result: Achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08 dB, SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling on Open MPI dataset; reduced nRMSE by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, improved SSIM by 34.3% over baseline methods; maintained strong performance up to 8x scaling.

Conclusion: VRF-Net enables sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction across multiple scales, offering promising potential for future in vivo MPI applications.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer
with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system
matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from
downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these
challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual
convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and
fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is
degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed
paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated
dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix
recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08
dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at
challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated
dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x
scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE
by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over
interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI
phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x
scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960),
outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables
sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction
across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo
applications.

Motivation: End-to-end optimization of opto-electronic neural networks is limited by costly simulations and large parameter spaces, making efficient design challenging.

Method: Two-stage strategy: 1) Train standard electronic CNN, 2) Realize optical front-end (metasurface array) through direct kernel optimization of first convolutional layer.

Result: Reduces computational and memory demands by hundreds of times, improves training stability, and achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training on monocular depth estimation under same constraints.

Conclusion: Two-stage design enables efficient and high-performance opto-electronic CNN development, overcoming limitations of end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: Opto-electronic neural networks integrate optical front-ends with electronic
back-ends to enable fast and energy-efficient vision. However, conventional
end-to-end optimization of both the optical and electronic modules is limited
by costly simulations and large parameter spaces. We introduce a two-stage
strategy for designing opto-electronic convolutional neural networks (CNNs):
first, train a standard electronic CNN, then realize the optical front-end
implemented as a metasurface array through direct kernel optimization of its
first convolutional layer. This approach reduces computational and memory
demands by hundreds of times and improves training stability compared to
end-to-end optimization. On monocular depth estimation, the proposed two-stage

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical AI systems for mammography face challenges due to dataset heterogeneity, metadata inconsistencies, and population distribution variations that introduce biases and compromise model generalizability.

Method: MammoClean standardizes case selection, image processing (laterality and intensity correction), and unifies metadata into consistent multi-view structure. It systematically identifies bias sources through comprehensive review of breast anatomy and imaging characteristics.

Result: Application to three datasets revealed substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence. AI models trained on corrupted datasets showed significant performance degradation compared to curated versions.

Conclusion: MammoClean enables construction of unified multi-dataset training corpora for developing robust AI models with superior cross-domain generalization, providing reproducible bias-aware pipeline for fairer comparisons and equitable performance across diverse populations.

Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems
for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata
standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This
heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the
generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We
present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias
quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,
image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies
metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive
review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography
datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to
three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify
substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.
Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models
trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation
compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and
mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training
corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain
generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for
bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and
advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across
diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is

TL;DR: SCORE is a weakly supervised framework that refines medical image segmentation predictions using only light feedback during training, eliminating the need for dense annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual medical image segmentation is labor-intensive and variable, while automated foundation models often lack clinical accuracy. Current refinement methods require heavy user interaction or full supervision.

Method: SCORE introduces a novel loss function that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels instead of dense training annotations.

Result: SCORE significantly improves initial predictions from TotalSegmentator on humerus CT scans, achieving performance comparable to existing refinement methods while greatly reducing supervision requirements and annotation time.

Conclusion: SCORE provides an effective weakly supervised approach for medical image segmentation refinement that maintains high accuracy while substantially reducing annotation burden.

Abstract: Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis.
Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to
variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently,
a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across
diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the
clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can
improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or
require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE
(Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised
framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback
during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image
annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality
scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on
humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from
TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement
methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation
time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.

Motivation: State-of-the-art 3D object detection models are complex, leading to long processing times and high power consumption on edge devices.

Method: Leverage Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method that splits computation between edge devices and cloud servers.

Result: Splitting after voxelization reduces inference time by 70.8% and edge device execution time by 90.0%. Splitting within the network reduces inference time by up to 57.1% and edge device execution time by up to 69.5%.

Conclusion: Split Computing effectively reduces computational burden on edge devices while maintaining performance and enhancing data security in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep
learning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point
cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for
3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex,
leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge
devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging
Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split
Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby
reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the
risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep
neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after
voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution
time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced
by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.

### [95] [Complete asymptotic type-token relationship for growing complex systems with inverse power-law count rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02069)
*Pablo Rosillo-Rodes,Laurent Hébert-Dufresne,Peter Sheridan Dodds*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an idealized model that deterministically produces inverse power-law type count rankings (Zipf's law) and derives exact asymptotics for the type-token relationship (Heaps' law), showing that Heaps' law arises as a consequence of Zipf's law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon earlier work by providing a unified asymptotic expression for the type-token relationship that works for all values of α, correcting previous special cases and avoiding unnecessary approximations or stochastic mechanisms.

Method: An idealized model of a growing system that deterministically produces arbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, relying solely on the form of count rankings without stochastic mechanisms or sampling processes.

Result: A unified asymptotic expression for the type-token relationship that works for all values of α, correcting the special cases of α = 1 and α ≫ 1, and demonstrating that Heaps' law arises as a consequence of Zipf's law.

Conclusion: The type-token relationship (Heaps' law) can be derived directly from Zipf's law through deterministic modeling, without requiring stochastic mechanisms or approximations, providing a more general and accurate framework.

Abstract: The growth dynamics of complex systems often exhibit statistical regularities
involving power-law relationships. For real finite complex systems formed by
countable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species,
dictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \sim r^{-\alpha}$ between
type count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely
observed to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is
Heaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the
total number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose
an idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces
arbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to
determine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument
improves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic
expression for all values of $\alpha$, which corrects the special cases of
$\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. Our approach relies solely on the form of
count rankings, avoids unnecessary approximations, and does not involve any
stochastic mechanisms or sampling processes. We thereby demonstrate that a
general type-token relationship arises solely as a consequence of Zipf's law.

*Zijian Zhang,Rong Wang,Shiyang Li,Yuebo Luo,Mingyi Hong,Caiwen Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CudaForge is a training-free multi-agent workflow that uses LLMs to automatically generate and optimize CUDA kernels, achieving 97.6% correctness and 1.68x speedup over PyTorch baselines with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CUDA kernel design is costly and time-consuming for AI applications like LLM training, while existing automatic methods produce inefficient kernels with high overhead and poor generalization.

Method: Uses two LLM agents (Coder and Judge) in an iterative workflow inspired by human experts, integrating hardware feedback from Nsight Compute metrics to generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels.

Result: Achieves 97.6% kernel correctness, 1.68x speedup over PyTorch, strong generalization across GPUs and base models, with only 26.5 minutes per kernel and $0.3 API cost.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, training-free workflows enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

TL;DR: A RAG framework for depression detection that retrieves emotional content from sentiment datasets and uses LLMs to generate Emotion Prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AVEC 2019.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current multimodal depression detection methods including high computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge constraints in sentiment analysis.

Method: Propose Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that retrieves semantically relevant emotional content from sentiment datasets and uses Large Language Models to generate Emotion Prompts as auxiliary modality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AVEC 2019 dataset with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and multi-task learning baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG framework effectively enhances emotional representation and interpretability in depression detection while overcoming computational and domain limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

### [98] [TapOut: A Bandit-Based Approach to Dynamic Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02017)
*Aditya Sridhar,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TapOut is a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the optimal number of tokens to draft in speculative decoding, eliminating the need for hand-tuned thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic speculative decoding methods rely on sensitive, hand-tuned thresholds that are costly to set and generalize poorly across models and domains, limiting the effectiveness of speculative decoding.

Method: TapOut uses multi-armed bandits with a meta-algorithm that selects among multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and exploration, requiring no hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and datasets show TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups compared to established dynamic speculation baselines without any hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: TapOut provides an effective, training-free solution for dynamic token drafting in speculative decoding that eliminates the need for manual threshold tuning while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

*Vivswan Shah,Randy Cogill,Hanwei Yue,Gopinath Chennupati,Rinat Khaziev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding explanations to labels during fine-tuning improves LLM classification performance, but surprisingly, even random tokens with matching vocabulary structure provide similar benefits by encouraging richer intermediate computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether attaching brief explanations to labels during fine-tuning yields better classification models compared to label-only training.

Method: Fine-tuned a 7B-parameter model using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, testing across six conversational datasets with three evaluation axes (naturalness, comprehensiveness, on-topic adherence). Compared label-plus-explanation training against label-only baselines and tested with random token explanations.

Result: Label-plus-explanation training outperformed label-only baselines across 18 dataset/task settings. Surprisingly, even syntactically incoherent pseudo-explanations (shuffled or bag-of-words variants) improved accuracy over label-only training and narrowed much of the gap to true explanations.

Conclusion: The performance gains come less from semantic meaning than from structural benefits - the extra token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in LLM classification.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CCS is reformulated as an eigenproblem for better understanding and extension to multiple variables, maintaining performance while improving stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the mechanisms of Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and extend its applicability beyond binary features.

Method: Reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem based on relative contrast consistency, yielding closed-form solutions with interpretable eigenvalues.

Result: The new approaches recover similar performance to CCS while avoiding sensitivity to random initialization problems.

Conclusion: Relativizing contrast consistency improves understanding of CCS and opens pathways for broader probing and interpretability methods.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

*Mayank Jobanputra,Nils Philipp Walter,Maitrey Mehta,Blerta Veseli,Evan Parker Kelly Chapple,Yifan Wang,Sneha Chetani,Ellie Pavlick,Antonio Vergari,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with subtraction, particularly in cases where the result should be negative, often producing correct magnitudes but omitting the negative sign. Instruction-tuning significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtraction has received little attention in LLM benchmarks despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation, unlike addition and multiplication.

Method: Evaluated eight pretrained LLMs across four families on addition and subtraction problems, conducted probing analyses, and tested few-shot learning and instruction-tuning techniques.

Result: Subtraction accuracy lags significantly behind addition, with errors concentrated in cases where a<b. LLMs internally encode negative results but often fail to output the negative sign. Instruction-tuning achieves near-perfect accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides clearer characterization of LLMs' limitations in subtraction and shows that instruction-tuning can effectively recover their arithmetic capabilities for generating negative signs.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

*Abhishek Panigrahi,Bingbin Liu,Sadhika Malladi,Sham Kakade,Surbhi Goel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRACE is a lightweight score that quantifies teacher effectiveness for knowledge distillation without needing teacher internals, logits, or test data, achieving up to 86% correlation with student performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting optimal teachers for knowledge distillation requires expensive trial-and-error, creating a need for an efficient method to predict teacher effectiveness before actual distillation.

Method: GRACE measures distributional properties of student gradients from an information-theoretic perspective, connecting to leave-one-out stability of gradient-based algorithms.

Result: GRACE achieves up to 86% Spearman correlation with distilled student performance on GSM8K and MATH, improving performance by up to 7.4% over naive teacher selection.

Conclusion: GRACE efficiently identifies compatible teachers and provides fine-grained guidance on distillation design choices including temperature settings, size constraints, and model family selection.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by
large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but
selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires
expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to
quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.
GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without
access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an
information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of
gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the
distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%
Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo
students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher
can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the
best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design
choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when
generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size
constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively
identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide
fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

TL;DR: FineXL provides fine-grained natural language explanations for personalized image generation models, identifying multiple personalization aspects with quantitative scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized image generation models lack explainability, especially fine-grained natural language explanations that can identify multiple personalization aspects and their varying levels.

Method: FineXL technique that generates natural language descriptions for each distinct aspect of personalization along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect.

Result: FineXL improves explainability accuracy by 56% across different personalization scenarios applied to multiple types of image generation models.

Conclusion: FineXL successfully addresses the limitation of coarse-grained explainability by providing fine-grained natural language explanations with quantitative personalization scores.

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

TL;DR: OmniField is a neural framework for multimodal spatiotemporal learning that handles sparse, irregular data and varying modality availability through cross-modal fusion and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal spatiotemporal data faces challenges of sparse/irregular measurements, noise, and varying modality availability across space and time, requiring models that can adapt to arbitrary modality subsets.

Method: Uses continuity-aware neural fields conditioned on available modalities with multimodal crosstalk blocks and iterative cross-modal refinement to align signals before decoding, enabling unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without preprocessing.

Result: Outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines and maintains performance close to clean-input levels under heavy simulated sensor noise, demonstrating robustness to corrupted measurements.

Conclusion: OmniField provides an effective framework for multimodal spatiotemporal learning that handles real-world data challenges through cross-modal fusion and iterative refinement, achieving robust performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

*Jiawei Liu,Enis Berk Çoban,Zarina Schevchenko,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu,Michael I Mandel,Johanna Devaney*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Interleaved instruction tuning in audio MLLMs improves reasoning but reduces audio labeling ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLLM training concatenates non-textual information with text, which may limit deep modality integration and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Used LTU model with interleaved audio tokens in prompts, tested on SHARD benchmark for audio semantic reasoning (synonym/hypernym recognition).

Result: Zero-shot interleaved prompting improves reasoning performance, and fine-tuning further enhances results but reduces audio labeling ability.

Conclusion: Interleaved training improves reasoning in audio MLLMs but comes at the cost of audio labeling performance.

Abstract: Standard training for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) involves
concatenating non-textual information, like vision or audio, with a text
prompt. This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities,
limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning
capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning
in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using
the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an
experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our
newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing
on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even
zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a
small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the
results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.

TL;DR: HAGI++ is a multi-modal diffusion-based method that uses head orientation sensors to impute missing gaze data, outperforming traditional interpolation and deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing gaze data due to blinks, pupil detection errors, and illumination changes poses significant challenges for gaze analysis in mobile eye tracking applications.

Method: Uses a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations, with optional extension to incorporate additional body movements like wrist motion.

Result: Outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning baselines on multiple datasets, produces realistic gaze velocity distributions, and achieves superior performance in extreme cases of 100% missing data.

Conclusion: Enables more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings, with significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various domains.

Abstract: Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention
across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an
essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to
human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil
detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for
further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a
multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the
first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the
inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a
transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye
and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional
body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,
and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms
conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series
imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses
confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match
actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.
Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable
devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture
in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our
method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in
real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based
analysis and interaction across various application domains.

### [109] [Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02304)
*Beyazit Yalcinkaya,Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte,Ameesh Shah,Hanna Krasowski,Sanjit A. Seshia*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ACC-MARL enables learning decentralized multi-agent policies for complex cooperative tasks by decomposing temporal objectives using automata and conditioning policies on task specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multi-agent reinforcement learning with temporal objectives are sample-inefficient and limited to single-task scenarios, lacking the ability to handle multiple complex cooperative tasks efficiently.

Method: Proposes Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent RL (ACC-MARL) that uses automata to decompose temporal tasks into simpler sub-tasks, learns task-conditioned decentralized policies, and enables optimal task assignment at test time using learned value functions.

Result: The framework achieves emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, demonstrated through tasks like pressing buttons to unlock doors, holding doors, and short-circuiting operations.

Conclusion: ACC-MARL provides a practical and theoretically sound approach for learning decentralized multi-agent policies that can handle multiple complex cooperative tasks with temporal dependencies, enabling efficient task decomposition and coordination.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,
e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and
short-circuiting tasks.

### [110] [A Step Toward World Models: A Survey on Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02097)
*Peng-Fei Zhang,Ying Cheng,Xiaofan Sun,Shijie Wang,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This survey paper analyzes world models in robotics, examining their core capabilities through robotic manipulation methods rather than imposing fixed definitions, and aims to develop a roadmap for practical world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents need to understand environmental dynamics beyond reactive control, requiring world models that encode states, capture dynamics, and enable prediction and planning.

Method: The survey reviews methods in robotic manipulation that exhibit world model capabilities, analyzing their roles across perception, prediction, and control to identify core components and functions.

Result: The paper identifies key challenges and solutions in world model development, distilling essential capabilities that real world models should possess for robotics applications.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the authors aim to outline a roadmap for developing generalizable and practical world models for robotics systems operating in complex environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents are increasingly expected to operate in complex, dynamic,
and uncertain environments, performing tasks such as manipulation, navigation,
and decision-making. Achieving these capabilities requires agents to understand
the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the world, moving beyond purely
reactive control or simple replication of observed states. This motivates the
development of world models as internal representations that encode
environmental states, capture dynamics, and enable prediction, planning, and
reasoning. Despite growing interest, the definition, scope, architectures, and
essential capabilities of world models remain ambiguous. In this survey, rather
than directly imposing a fixed definition and limiting our scope to methods
explicitly labeled as world models, we examine approaches that exhibit the core
capabilities of world models through a review of methods in robotic
manipulation. We analyze their roles across perception, prediction, and
control, identify key challenges and solutions, and distill the core
components, capabilities, and functions that a real world model should possess.
Building on this analysis, we aim to outline a roadmap for developing
generalizable and practical world models for robotics.

*Yanjie Ze,Siheng Zhao,Weizhuo Wang,Angjoo Kanazawa,Rocky Duan,Pieter Abbeel,Guanya Shi,Jiajun Wu,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TWIST2 is a portable, mocap-free humanoid teleoperation system that enables whole-body control and efficient data collection using VR and custom hardware, achieving high success rates and enabling autonomous visuomotor policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robotics lacks scalable data collection frameworks compared to other robotics domains, with existing systems using decoupled control or expensive motion capture setups.

Method: Uses PICO4U VR for real-time whole-body motion capture and a custom 2-DoF robot neck for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control without motion capture.

Result: Achieves long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills, collects 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with nearly 100% success rate, and demonstrates autonomous whole-body dexterous manipulation and dynamic kicking.

Conclusion: TWIST2 provides a scalable, reproducible framework for humanoid teleoperation and data collection, enabling advanced visuomotor policies and advancing humanoid robotics capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models
to vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid
robotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid
teleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive
motion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid
teleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control
while advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining
real-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around
$250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We
demonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can
collect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.
Building on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy
framework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric
vision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous
manipulation and dynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible
and open-sourced at https://yanjieze.com/TWIST2 . Our collected dataset is also
open-sourced at https://twist-data.github.io .

### [112] [A Kullback-Leibler divergence method for input-system-state identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02426)
*Marios Impraimakis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A Kullback-Leibler divergence method is used within Kalman filter framework to select the most plausible input-parameter-state estimation by comparing posterior distributions to prior distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in obtaining different results from different initial parameter set guesses in system identification, using information gained from data to select the most plausible estimation.

Method: 1) Perform Kalman filter for multiple initial parameter sets, 2) Compare resulting posterior distributions to prior distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence, 3) Select identification with least divergence as most plausible.

Result: The method successfully selects the better performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information applications.

Conclusion: The Kullback-Leibler divergence approach provides a powerful tool for system monitoring by reliably identifying the most plausible parameter-state estimation.

Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined
herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state
estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification
suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from
different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the
information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior
distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for
a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system
input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior
distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions
using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the
least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most
plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better
performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information
applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.

### [113] [An unscented Kalman filter method for real time input-parameter-state estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02717)
*Marios Impraimakis,Andrew W. Smyth*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel unscented Kalman filter is developed for joint estimation of dynamic states, parameters, and unknown inputs in both linear and nonlinear systems using a two-stage estimation process within each time step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve system understanding compared to classical output-only parameter identification strategies by enabling joint real-time estimation of all dynamic states, parameters, and inputs.

Method: Two-stage unscented Kalman filter approach: first stage uses predicted states and parameters to estimate input, second stage uses measurement-corrected states and parameters for final estimation. Perturbation analysis demonstrates identifiability conditions.

Result: The method successfully estimates unknown inputs, dynamic states, and parameters jointly in real-time. Systems with at least zero or non-zero known inputs can be uniquely identified.

Conclusion: This output-only methodology provides superior system understanding compared to classical approaches by enabling comprehensive joint estimation of states, parameters, and inputs in real-time.

Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman
filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown
input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted
dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input.
Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final
estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis
that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially
be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better
understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter
identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters,
and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.

### [114] [Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep values or Shallow Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02109)
*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) tests whether LLMs learn fundamental human values or just surface-level preferences, finding that models generalize deep values less than chance (average DVGR = 0.30).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between AI systems that capture deeper human values (enabling robust alignment) versus those that only learn superficial patterns (risking misaligned behavior).

Method: Uses controlled confounding between deep values and shallow features in training, then breaks correlations in testing to measure Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR).

Result: Across 9 models, average DVGR is 0.30; all models generalize deep values less than chance; larger models have slightly lower DVGR than smaller models.

Conclusion: DVB provides an interpretable measure of alignment core features, revealing current LLMs' limitations in learning fundamental human values.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

### [115] [InsurAgent: A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Simulating Individual Behavior in Purchasing Flood Insurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02119)
*Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Dan M. Frangopol,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InsurAgent is an LLM-empowered agent that combines retrieval-augmented generation with reasoning modules to accurately model flood insurance purchase decisions, addressing LLMs' limitations in quantitative probability estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low flood insurance participation rates among at-risk populations in the US highlight the need to understand behavioral mechanisms behind insurance decisions, and LLMs offer promising tools for simulating human decision-making.

Method: Proposed InsurAgent with five modules: perception, retrieval (using RAG to ground decisions in empirical survey data), reasoning (leveraging LLM common sense), action, and memory (for temporal decision evolution simulation).

Result: InsurAgent achieves accurate estimation of marginal and bivariate probabilities, captures contextual information intractable for traditional models, and can simulate temporal decision evolutions through life trajectories.

Conclusion: InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral modeling and policy analysis by combining empirical data grounding with LLM reasoning capabilities to model insurance decisions.

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

### [116] [Personalized Decision Modeling: Utility Optimization or Textualized-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02194)
*Yibo Zhao,Yang Zhao,Hongru Du,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATHENA is a framework that combines symbolic utility functions with LLM-based semantic adaptation to model personalized human decision-making, outperforming existing models in travel mode and vaccine choice tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual decision-making often differs from population-level predictions, especially in high-stakes scenarios like vaccine uptake, due to unique personal factors including numerical attributes and linguistic influences.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) LLM-augmented symbolic discovery for group-level utility functions, 2) Individual-level semantic adaptation creating personalized semantic templates guided by optimal utility.

Result: Consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models, achieving at least 6.5% F1 score improvement over strongest baseline models in travel mode and vaccine choice tasks.

Conclusion: ATHENA provides an effective scheme for human-centric decision modeling by organically integrating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, with both stages being critical and complementary.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

TL;DR: PPP is a multi-objective RL approach that jointly optimizes productivity, proactivity, and personalization for AI agents, achieving 21.6% average improvement over GPT-5 on software engineering and research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses mainly on task success, but effective real-world agents need to optimize three key dimensions: productivity (task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and personalization (adapting to user preferences).

Method: Introduced UserVille environment with LLM-based user simulators for diverse preferences, and PPP - a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all three dimensions.

Result: Agents trained with PPP achieved substantial improvements over strong baselines like GPT-5 (+21.6% on average), showing ability to ask strategic clarifying questions, adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better interaction.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction across productivity, proactivity, and personalization is critical for building practical and effective AI agents.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

*Zhiwei Zhang,Xiaomin Li,Yudi Lin,Hui Liu,Ramraj Chandradevan,Linlin Wu,Minhua Lin,Fali Wang,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses lazy agent behavior in multi-agent reasoning systems where one agent dominates collaboration, proposing methods to measure causal influence and implement verifiable rewards to encourage balanced participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent reasoning systems suffer from lazy agent behavior where one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration and making the setup effectively a single agent system.

Method: The authors provide theoretical analysis of lazy behavior, introduce a stable method for measuring causal influence, and propose a verifiable reward mechanism that allows reasoning agents to discard noisy outputs and restart reasoning when necessary.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The introduced methods effectively mitigate lazy agent behavior in multi-agent reasoning systems, enabling more balanced collaboration and improved performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

*Tim R. Davidson,Adam Fourney,Saleema Amershi,Robert West,Eric Horvitz,Ece Kamar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agent collaboration faces a 'collaboration gap' where models performing well solo degrade substantially when working together, requiring new evaluation methods and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly rely on heterogeneous agents with different capabilities and information, effective collaboration becomes critical, but few empirical studies have evaluated agent-agent collaboration at scale.

Method: Developed a collaborative maze-solving benchmark that isolates collaborative capabilities, modulates complexity, enables automated grading, and preserves ecological plausibility. Evaluated 32 leading models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings.

Result: Revealed a significant collaboration gap where solo-performing models degrade substantially when collaborating. Small distilled models that solve mazes well alone may fail completely in certain pairings. Starting with stronger agents improves outcomes, motivating 'relay inference' approach.

Conclusion: Findings argue for collaboration-aware evaluation, training strategies to enhance collaborative capabilities, and interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent skills, applicable to both AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CostBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' cost-aware planning and adaptability in dynamic environments, focusing on economic reasoning rather than just task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent evaluations overlook resource efficiency and adaptability to changing environments, neglecting crucial cost-optimization capabilities.

Method: Created CostBench in travel-planning domain with multiple solution paths using atomic/composite tools with customizable costs, plus four types of dynamic blocking events (tool failures, cost changes) to simulate real-world unpredictability.

Result: Leading models show substantial gaps in cost-aware planning: agents often fail to find optimal solutions in static settings (GPT-5 <75% exact match on hardest tasks), with performance dropping ~40% under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: CostBench identifies key weaknesses in current agents' economic reasoning and lays groundwork for developing more economically rational and robust agents.

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

TL;DR: Agent-Omni framework coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system for flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are limited to fixed modality pairs, require costly fine-tuning, and lack robust reasoning support for fully omni-capable models integrating text, images, audio, and video.

Method: A master-agent system where the master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: The agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability, with modular and extensible framework for future improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.
