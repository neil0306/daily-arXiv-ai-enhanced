### [1] [Uncovering the Vulnerability of Large Language Models in the Financial Domain via Risk Concealment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10546)
*Gang Cheng,Haibo Jin,Wenbin Zhang,Haohan Wang,Jun Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a multi-turn red-teaming framework that exposes vulnerabilities in financial LLMs by concealing regulatory risks to elicit regulatory-violating responses, achieving 93.18% average attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming research focuses on harmful content but neglects regulatory risks in financial LLMs, creating a critical gap in understanding their vulnerability to regulatory compliance failures.

Method: Developed Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA) - a multi-turn iterative framework that conceals regulatory risks, and created FIN-Bench benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLM safety in financial contexts.

Result: RCA successfully bypassed nine mainstream LLMs with 93.18% average attack success rate, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1, revealing significant vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Current alignment techniques have critical gaps in financial domains, requiring stronger moderation mechanisms and domain-aware LLM alignment approaches for robust financial applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial
applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful
content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to
investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches.
We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that
iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet
regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we
construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in
financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA
effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success
rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1.
These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and
underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial
domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and
domain-aware LLM alignment.

### [2] [No Answer Needed: Predicting LLM Answer Accuracy from Question-Only Linear Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10625)
*Iván Vicente Moreno Cencerrado,Arnau Padrés Masdemont,Anton Gonzalvez Hawthorne,David Demitri Africa,Lorenzo Pacchiardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can internally predict answer correctness before generating responses, with this predictive ability emerging in intermediate layers and generalizing across domains except mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs have internal mechanisms that anticipate when their answers will be correct before generating them, and to study how this self-assessment capability works across different model sizes and question types.

Method: Extract activations after question reading but before token generation, train linear probes to predict forthcoming answer correctness, test across 7B-70B parameter models on trivia and diverse knowledge datasets, compare with black-box baselines and verbal confidence.

Result: Linear probes trained on generic trivia successfully predict correctness in-distribution and out-of-distribution, outperforming baselines. Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers. Generalization fails on mathematical reasoning. Same direction captures confidence in "I don't know" responses.

Conclusion: LLMs develop internal self-assessment capabilities that emerge mid-computation, providing essential insights into model internals and complementing previous findings on truthfulness and behavior through probing techniques.

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly?
To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any
tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's
forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families
ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance
correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in
distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets,
outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence.
Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that
self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on
questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I
don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that
the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results
on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse
auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM
internals.

### [3] [Interdisciplinary Research in Conversation: A Case Study in Computational Morphology for Language Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10644)
*Enora Rice,Katharina von der Wense,Alexis Palmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Computational morphology tools like GlossLM show strong technical performance but fail to meet real-world usability needs in language documentation, requiring user-centered design integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the disconnect between computational morphology research and practical language documentation needs, where research outputs see limited real-world application despite technical advances.

Method: Position paper with case study of GlossLM (multilingual IGT generation model) and small-scale user study with three documentary linguists to evaluate usability in real documentation contexts.

Result: Despite strong metric-based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs, revealing issues with model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization.

Conclusion: User-centered design is essential for producing effective tools and surfacing richer research directions in computational morphology, preventing the field from becoming decontextualized and ineffectual.

Abstract: Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation
through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear
Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in
real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the
disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a
broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the
field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic
integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from
UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a
state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user
study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric
based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real
documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around
model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We
argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces
richer, more relevant research directions

### [4] [Context Copying Modulation: The Role of Entropy Neurons in Managing Parametric and Contextual Knowledge Conflicts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10663)
*Zineddine Tighidet,Andrea Mogini,Hedi Ben-younes,Jiali Mei,Patrick Gallinari,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Entropy neurons in LLMs suppress context copying behavior when contextual information conflicts with parametric knowledge, and ablating these neurons significantly alters generation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle conflicting information between context and internal knowledge, specifically investigating the role of entropy neurons in inhibiting context copying behavior.

Method: Analyzed entropy neurons across various LLMs, conducted ablation studies to observe changes in generation behavior when these neurons are removed.

Result: Entropy neurons are responsible for suppressing context copying in transformers, and their ablation leads to significant changes in the generation process during information conflicts.

Conclusion: These findings improve our understanding of LLM internal dynamics when processing conflicting information, revealing the specific role of entropy neurons in context suppression.

Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when facing contextual
information that conflicts with their internal parametric knowledge is
inconsistent, with no generally accepted explanation for the expected outcome
distribution. Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a
class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect
on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the
ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary
claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in
transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual
and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for
suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them
leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance
our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting
information.

### [5] [Pluralistic Alignment for Healthcare: A Role-Driven Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10685)
*Jiayou Zhong,Anudeex Shetty,Chao Jia,Xuanrui Lin,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EthosAgents is a lightweight pluralistic alignment approach that simulates diverse perspectives for language models in healthcare, showing improved alignment across various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment approaches fall short in healthcare where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism, requiring models to reflect diverse values and perspectives.

Method: Proposed EthosAgents - a lightweight, generalizable pluralistic alignment approach designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values.

Result: Empirically shown to advance pluralistic alignment for all three modes across seven varying-sized open and closed models.

Conclusion: Health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches, offering insights for better respecting diversity in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such
as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and
perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment
approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall
short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors
shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we
propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach,
EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We
empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes
across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that
health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches,
offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other
high-stakes domains.

### [6] [Struct-Bench: A Benchmark for Differentially Private Structured Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10696)
*Shuaiqi Wang,Vikas Raunak,Arturs Backurs,Victor Reis,Pei Zhou,Sihao Chen,Longqi Yang,Zinan Lin,Sergey Yekhanin,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Struct-Bench is a framework and benchmark for evaluating differentially private synthetic data generation methods on structured datasets containing natural language, using Context-Free Grammars to represent dataset structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques struggle to capture structural properties and correlations in structured datasets with natural language components, which are common in enterprise settings but lack proper evaluation standards.

Method: Proposes Struct-Bench framework requiring users to represent dataset structure as Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), includes 5 real-world and 2 synthetic datasets with CFG annotations, reference metric implementations, and a leaderboard.

Result: The benchmark datasets present significant challenges for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods, and the framework provides a standardized evaluation platform for researchers.

Conclusion: Struct-Bench offers a comprehensive evaluation framework that enables standardized benchmarking and improvement of privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods for structured data with natural language components.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising
technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for
model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused
on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings,
structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural
language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques
(e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of
such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark
for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain
natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a
representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our
benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each
annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great
challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods.
Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a
leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform
to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation
methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench
to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured
data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at
https://struct-bench.github.io.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning. However,
these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications,
including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain
expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these
limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured
knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms
including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external
knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy
construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that
transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate
how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based
methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also
identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and
knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal
retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This
comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights
into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.

### [8] [SearchInstruct: Enhancing Domain Adaptation via Retrieval-Based Instruction Dataset Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10708)
*Iman Barati,Mostafa Amiri,Heshaam Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SearchInstruct is a method that automatically constructs high-quality instruction datasets for supervised fine-tuning by expanding human-generated questions with LLMs and retrieving domain-specific resources to generate accurate answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating suitable training datasets for domain-specific SFT is challenging due to unique domain constraints and data scarcity, requiring an automated approach to generate diverse and high-quality instruction-response pairs.

Method: Starts with limited human-generated domain questions, systematically expands them using a large language model, then dynamically retrieves domain-relevant resources to generate accurate answers for each augmented question.

Result: Enhances both diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains, and also facilitates model editing tasks.

Conclusion: SearchInstruct provides an effective automated solution for constructing high-quality domain-specific instruction datasets, improving LLM fine-tuning while enabling additional applications like model editing, with full implementation made publicly available.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models
(LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction
following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training
datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain
constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an
innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction
datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific,
human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large
language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically
retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each
augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct
enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable
improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we
show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively
facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing
models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full
implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response
pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository:

### [9] [PolyTruth: Multilingual Disinformation Detection using Transformer-Based Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10737)
*Zaur Gouliev,Jennifer Waters,Chengqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of 5 multilingual transformer models for disinformation detection across 25 languages, revealing performance variations and limitations in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI models are benchmarked only on English despite disinformation spreading rapidly across linguistic boundaries, creating a gap in multilingual disinformation detection capabilities.

Method: Compared mBERT, XLM, XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on fake-vs-true classification using PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus - 60,486 statement pairs across 25 languages covering 5 language families and diverse topics.

Result: RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, especially in low-resource languages, while mBERT and XLM showed significant limitations when training data was scarce.

Conclusion: The study reveals both potential and current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation detection, with performance patterns varying by model and language resource availability.

Abstract: Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI
models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a
systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM,
XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning
classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated
notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in
multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we
introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs
(false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that
collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from
politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are
fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery
dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as
RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in
low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable
limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these
performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is
publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further
experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and
the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation
detection.

### [10] [Reasoning Under Uncertainty: Exploring Probabilistic Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10739)
*Mobina Pournemat,Keivan Rezaei,Gaurang Sriramanan,Arman Zarei,Jiaxiang Fu,Yang Wang,Hamid Eghbalzadeh,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent probabilistic reasoning abilities with performance gaps between small and large models, notable limitations in notation sensitivity, and context length degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively study LLMs' probabilistic reasoning capabilities over explicit discrete probability distributions, as their behavior in probabilistic tasks remains unclear and inconsistent despite success in other language tasks.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on three tasks (mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, sample generation) using prompts about joint distributions or conditionals, testing frequency analysis, marginalization, and generative behavior through empirical evaluations.

Result: Larger models show stronger inference and surprising sample generation capabilities, but all models exhibit sensitivity to probability notation variations and performance degradation over 60% with increasing context length.

Conclusion: The study provides detailed understanding of LLMs' probabilistic reasoning abilities and identifies key improvement directions, highlighting the need for better probabilistic reasoning in language models.

Abstract: Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large
language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when
faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over
explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a
probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks,
mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by
prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint
distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of
probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and
generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we
demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and
larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising
capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal
notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation
utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of
over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed
understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key
directions for future improvement.

*Ozan Gokdemir,Neil Getty,Robert Underwood,Sandeep Madireddy,Franck Cappello,Arvind Ramanathan,Ian T. Foster,Rick L. Stevens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable framework for generating multiple-choice question benchmarks from scientific papers, tested with 16,000+ questions from radiation/cancer biology papers, showing that reasoning-trace retrieval helps small models outperform GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific knowledge grows rapidly, requiring benchmarks to evolve and test language models on current, diverse literature rather than outdated datasets.

Method: Automated pipeline for MCQA creation including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and model evaluation. Uses retrieval-augmented generation with paper-derived semantic chunks and reasoning traces from GPT-4.1.

Result: Generated 16,000+ MCQs from 22,000 open-access articles. Reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improved performance, enabling small models (1.1B-14B parameters) to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

Conclusion: The framework successfully creates scalable scientific benchmarks, and reasoning-trace retrieval is an effective method for enhancing small language model performance on specialized scientific tasks.

Abstract: As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks
must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on
current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for
generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from
large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA
creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and
model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from
22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a
suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions,
comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from
paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.
We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on
both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models
to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

### [12] [RECAP: Transparent Inference-Time Emotion Alignment for Medical Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10746)
*Adarsh Srinivasan,Jacob Dineen,Muhammad Umar Afzal,Muhammad Uzair Sarfraz,Irbaz B. Riaz,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP is an inference-time framework that improves emotional reasoning in medical AI by 22-28% on smaller models and 10-13% on larger models through structured emotional reasoning without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models in healthcare often provide medically accurate but emotionally flat advice, which is problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable and require empathic communication for safety, adherence, and trust.

Method: RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce) framework that decomposes empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and uses per-dimension Likert signals to produce nuanced, auditable responses without retraining.

Result: 22-28% improvement in emotional reasoning on 8B models and 10-13% improvement on larger models over zero-shot baselines across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench. Clinician evaluations confirmed superior empathetic communication.

Conclusion: Modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability required for deployment.

Abstract: Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues,
delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. This is especially
problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable,
and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We
present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time
framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By
decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing
per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses.
Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by
22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines.
Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP
shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance
emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability
required for deployment.

### [13] [Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10798)
*Yijun Liu,Yixuan Wang,Yuzhuang Xu,Shiyu Ji,Yang Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Judge Q is a novel training method that uses soft tokens to improve KV cache eviction by capturing global information, reducing performance degradation while maintaining low training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KV cache eviction methods focus too much on local information from the last window, potentially missing crucial global context, which affects memory usage and decoding efficiency in large language models.

Method: Proposes Judge Q method that tunes only the embedding layer by concatenating a soft token list to input sequences. These soft tokens are trained to align their attention maps with actual decoded tokens, enabling them to capture global information for better KV importance evaluation.

Result: Under same eviction budget, shows less performance degradation than existing approaches. Improves LongBench by ~1 point and RULER by over 3 points. Validated on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 models.

Conclusion: The method effectively maintains decoding quality during KV cache eviction by capturing global information through soft tokens, with minimal training overhead and seamless integration into existing models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical
information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as
the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and
decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize
the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV
importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it
tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect
or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This
method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By
concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train
these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that
of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the
soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the
importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining
decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our
method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction
approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models
such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks
including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an
improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on
RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing
open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing
performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

### [14] [Towards Automated Error Discovery: A Study in Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10833)
*Dominic Petrak,Thy Thy Tran,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework called Automated Error Discovery with SEEED implementation that detects unknown errors in conversational AI using enhanced encoder-based methods, outperforming LLM baselines like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based conversational agents still produce errors that are hard to detect, especially those not explicitly specified in instructions or arising from model updates and user behavior shifts.

Method: Introduces SEEED (Soft Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection) with enhanced Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss (amplifying negative sample distance weighting) and Label-Based Sample Ranking for better representation learning.

Result: Outperforms adapted baselines including GPT-4o and Phi-4 across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving unknown error detection accuracy by up to 8 points with strong generalization to unknown intent detection.

Conclusion: The proposed Automated Error Discovery framework with SEEED implementation effectively detects and defines errors in conversational AI, demonstrating superior performance over current LLM approaches for identifying unknown errors.

Abstract: Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and
coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are
challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research
leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide
response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle
to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as
those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user
behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for
detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft
Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based
approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by

### [15] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Evidence-Based Clinical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10843)
*Can Wang,Yiqun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for clinical question answering but performance varies significantly based on source type (90% accuracy on structured guidelines vs 60-70% on narrative/systematic reviews), with retrieval-augmented prompting improving accuracy when using gold-standard sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate LLMs' ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based clinical questions from diverse sources including Cochrane reviews and clinical guidelines, given their growing use in biomedical applications.

Method: Curated multi-source benchmark from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, tested GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5 models, analyzed performance patterns across sources, and evaluated retrieval-augmented prompting with gold-source abstracts and PubMed search results.

Result: Structured guidelines achieved 90% accuracy while narrative guidelines and systematic reviews showed 60-70% accuracy. Citation count strongly correlated with accuracy (30% odds increase per doubling). Retrieval with gold-source abstracts improved accuracy to 0.79, while PubMed abstracts (top 3 relevant) reached 0.23 accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise but current limitations for evidence-based clinical QA. Source clarity and targeted retrieval drive performance more than model size. Retrieval-augmented prompting improves factual accuracy, and stratified evaluation by specialty/question type is essential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in
biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their
ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source
benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines,
including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and
narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe
consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy
is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative
guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong
correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying
systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly
a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to
reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we
incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract
raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed
abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while
random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These
effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and
targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our
results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for
evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting
emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with
source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type
remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize
model performance.

### [16] [GAPrune: Gradient-Alignment Pruning for Domain-Aware Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10844)
*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAPrune is a novel pruning framework that distinguishes domain-specific from general parameters using Fisher Information and gradient alignment, achieving near-original performance at 50% sparsity and even enhancing domain capabilities with retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific embedding models outperform general models but are too large for resource-constrained environments. Existing pruning methods treat all parameters uniformly, failing to preserve both domain-specific patterns and general linguistic foundation.

Method: Uses Fisher Information to measure importance and general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, combining these signals with Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring to identify parameters that are either less important for domain tasks or create conflicts between domain and general objectives.

Result: Maintains performance within 2.5% of dense models at 50% sparsity in one-shot pruning. With 100-step retraining, achieves +4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, outperforming all baselines.

Conclusion: Principled pruning strategies can achieve both model compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing a new approach for developing efficient domain-specific embedding models.

Abstract: Domain-specific embedding models have shown promise for applications that
require specialized semantic understanding, such as coding agents and financial
retrieval systems, often achieving higher performance gains than general
models. However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs,
which contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in
resource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a
promising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters
uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and
domain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we
propose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by
considering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic
foundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and
general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines
these signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI
scores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task
or creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two
domain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance
within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while
outperforming all baselines. With retraining in 100 steps, GAPrune achieves
+4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, demonstrating that our
pruning strategy not only preserves but enhances domain-specific capabilities.
Our findings demonstrate that principled pruning strategies can achieve model
compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing the research
community with a new approach for development.

*Liqian Feng,Lintao Wang,Kun Hu,Dehui Kong,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2SignDiff is a gloss-free sign language production method that uses diffusion models to directly translate spoken text to sign language sequences without intermediate gloss representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLP methods rely on gloss annotations which are often unavailable and language-specific, limiting flexibility and generalization. This creates a need for gloss-free approaches that can directly translate spoken language to sign language.

Method: Proposes a gloss-free latent diffusion model that generates sign language sequences from noisy latent sign codes and spoken text through non-autoregressive iterative denoising. Also designs a cross-modal signing aligner to learn a shared latent space bridging visual and textual content.

Result: Extensive experiments on PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing the method's effectiveness in accurate and contextually relevant sign language generation without gloss.

Conclusion: The proposed Text2SignDiff approach successfully eliminates the need for gloss annotations in SLP, providing a more flexible and generalizable solution that bridges communication gaps for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities through direct spoken-to-sign translation.

Abstract: Sign language production (SLP) aims to translate spoken language sentences
into a sequence of pose frames in a sign language, bridging the communication
gap and promoting digital inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
Existing methods typically rely on gloss, a symbolic representation of sign
language words or phrases that serves as an intermediate step in SLP. This
limits the flexibility and generalization of SLP, as gloss annotations are
often unavailable and language-specific. Therefore, we present a novel
diffusion-based generative approach - Text2Sign Diffusion (Text2SignDiff) for
gloss-free SLP. Specifically, a gloss-free latent diffusion model is proposed
to generate sign language sequences from noisy latent sign codes and spoken
text jointly, reducing the potential error accumulation through a
non-autoregressive iterative denoising process. We also design a cross-modal
signing aligner that learns a shared latent space to bridge visual and textual
content in sign and spoken languages. This alignment supports the conditioned
diffusion-based process, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant sign
language generation without gloss. Extensive experiments on the commonly used
PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

### [18] [A funny companion: Distinct neural responses to perceived AI- versus human- generated humor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10847)
*Xiaohui Rao,Hanlin Wu,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEG study shows AI humor elicits stronger emotional responses (larger LPP) with less cognitive effort (smaller N400) than human humor, challenging algorithm aversion and demonstrating brain's adaptive updating of AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI companions become capable of human-like communication including humor, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to AI humor becomes important for human-AI social interaction.

Method: Used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare neural processing of humor from AI versus human sources, analyzing N400 (cognitive effort) and LPP (emotional response) components, along with behavioral ratings.

Result: Behaviorally, AI and human humor rated equally funny. Neurophysiologically: AI humor showed smaller N400 (reduced cognitive effort), larger LPP (greater surprise/emotional response), and different temporal dynamics with increasing efficiency and emotional reward over time. Social attitudes modulated responses.

Conclusion: Brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and intense reactions, demonstrating cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to intensified emotional reward, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine engagement in human-AI interaction.

Abstract: As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including
telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to
AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography
(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.
Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as
comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor
elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the
processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive
Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional
response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial
expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal
dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an
increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor
demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a
decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain
can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of
cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it
demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an
intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes
toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI
trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings
indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and
intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine
engagement in human-AI social interaction.

*Sangyeop Kim,Yohan Lee,Sanghwa Kim,Hyunjong Kim,Sungzoon Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMem shifts complex reasoning from response generation to memory construction, creating enriched memory representations with explicit relationships across sessions, significantly improving performance across all model sizes while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems place excessive reasoning burden on response generation, making performance heavily dependent on model sizes. There's a need to improve long-term memory synthesis across multiple sessions without requiring large models.

Method: PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information. It establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions, capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and implications. This reasoning is performed during pre-storage rather than during response generation.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements across all model sizes. Smaller models achieve results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness even with constrained token budgets.

Conclusion: PREMem effectively reduces computational demands during interactions by shifting complex reasoning to memory construction, enabling better long-term memory synthesis and making conversational AI performance less dependent on model size.

Abstract: Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing
information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive
reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly
dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for
Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from
inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments
categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then
establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions,
capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and
implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when
generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing
computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant
performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving
results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness
even with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at

*Shaohua Fang,Yue Li,Yan Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show human-like preference for surface scope interpretations in English and Chinese quantifier sentences, with variability in inverse scope preferences influenced by model architecture, scale, and pre-training data language background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how large language models handle quantifier scope interpretation ambiguities across different languages (English and Chinese) and assess their alignment with human interpretive patterns.

Method: Cross-linguistic approach using probabilities to assess interpretive likelihood, with Human Similarity (HS) scores to quantify how closely LLMs emulate human performance across language groups.

Result: Most LLMs prefer surface scope interpretations (aligning with human tendencies), while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in inverse scope preferences. HS scores show variability but overall notable potential for human alignment.

Conclusion: Model architecture, scale, and particularly pre-training data language background significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human quantifier scope interpretations across languages.

Abstract: Sentences with multiple quantifiers often lead to interpretive ambiguities,
which can vary across languages. This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach
to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope
interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess
interpretive likelihood. Human similarity (HS) scores were used to quantify the
extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results
reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with
human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in
the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores
highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their
overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model
architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language
background, significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human
quantifier scope interpretations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Term2Note is a differentially private method for synthesizing clinical notes that separates content and form generation, achieving strong privacy protection while maintaining high data utility comparable to real clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in healthcare limit the use of real clinical data for ML training. Differentially private synthetic data offers privacy guarantees but struggles with balancing privacy and utility in complex clinical note generation.

Method: Term2Note structurally separates content and form generation, creating section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms with separate privacy constraints, and uses a DP quality maximizer to select high-quality outputs.

Result: The method produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely matching real clinical notes and enables classification models to perform comparably to those trained on real data, with substantial improvements over existing DP baselines.

Conclusion: Term2Note demonstrates potential as a viable privacy-preserving alternative for clinical note synthesis, operating under fewer assumptions while achieving strong fidelity and utility under strong DP constraints.

Abstract: Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning
models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world
training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A
promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP)
synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data
utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and
utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain
specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we
present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong
DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note
generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each
governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances
synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show
that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely
aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition,
multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform
comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility.
Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves
substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under
fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving
alternative to using sensitive clinical notes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CultureSynth is a new framework that creates a comprehensive multilingual cultural benchmark using RAG to automatically generate culturally relevant questions, addressing limitations of existing manual evaluation methods for LLM cultural competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cultural competence evaluations for LLMs suffer from fragmented taxonomies, domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation, limiting scalability and comprehensiveness.

Method: Developed CultureSynth framework with (1) hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary/130 secondary topics, and (2) RAG-based methodology using factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant question-answer pairs.

Result: Created CultureSynth-7 benchmark with 19,360 entries (4,149 manually verified) across 7 languages. Evaluation of 14 LLMs showed performance stratification with ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct leading, revealed 3B-parameter threshold for basic competence, architectural biases, and geographic disparities.

Conclusion: CultureSynth provides a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI systems while reducing manual annotation reliance, enabling better assessment of LLM cultural competence across diverse contexts.

Abstract: Cultural competence, defined as the ability to understand and adapt to
multicultural contexts, is increasingly vital for large language models (LLMs)
in global environments. While several cultural benchmarks exist to assess LLMs'
cultural competence, current evaluations suffer from fragmented taxonomies,
domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address
these limitations, we introduce CultureSynth, a novel framework comprising (1)
a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary
and 130 secondary topics, and (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based
methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant
question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360
entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of
14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification
led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that
a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence,
models display varying architectural biases in knowledge processing, and
significant geographic disparities exist across models. We believe that
CultureSynth offers a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI
systems while reducing reliance on manual annotation\footnote{Benchmark is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A semi-automatic method using ontology design, pattern modeling, and LLMs to convert ESG principles into RDF templates for extracting structured knowledge from news to identify non-compliance with sustainability frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for accurate ESG data alignment with international frameworks like UN Global Compact and SDGs, but challenges exist due to abstract language, lack of standardized taxonomies, and proprietary classification systems.

Method: Uses lightweight ontology design, formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative principles into reusable RDF templates for extracting information from news content to populate structured knowledge graphs.

Result: Creates a scalable and transparent framework for identifying and interpreting non-compliance with international sustainability guidelines by linking reported incidents to specific framework principles.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective solution for aligning unstructured ESG controversy data with principle-based normative frameworks through structured knowledge representation.

Abstract: The growing importance of environmental, social, and governance data in
regulatory and investment contexts has increased the need for accurate,
interpretable, and internationally aligned representations of non-financial
risks, particularly those reported in unstructured news sources. However,
aligning such controversy-related data with principle-based normative
frameworks, such as the United Nations Global Compact or Sustainable
Development Goals, presents significant challenges. These frameworks are
typically expressed in abstract language, lack standardized taxonomies, and
differ from the proprietary classification systems used by commercial data
providers. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for constructing
structured knowledge representations of environmental, social, and governance
events reported in the news. Our approach uses lightweight ontology design,
formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative
principles into reusable templates expressed in the Resource Description
Framework. These templates are used to extract relevant information from news
content and populate a structured knowledge graph that links reported incidents
to specific framework principles. The result is a scalable and transparent
framework for identifying and interpreting non-compliance with international
sustainability guidelines.

Motivation: Traditional summaries prioritize comprehensive coverage but often lack engagement. The authors aim to create narratives that selectively emphasize intriguing content to foster deeper reader engagement with source material.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fine-tuning a large language model on benchmark datasets curated for spotlight generation, 2) Alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance quality.

Result: The model demonstrates precise identification of key elements, enhanced readability, and significantly boosted engagement value of original documents compared to traditional summarization approaches.

Conclusion: Spotlight represents an effective paradigm shift from comprehensive summarization to engaging narrative generation, successfully balancing precision, readability, and engagement through fine-tuned LLM with DPO alignment.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information
extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most
compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which
prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing
content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We
formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our
analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this
work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach:
fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment
via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation
demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with
precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for explainable clickbait detection that identifies clickbait headlines and attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation strategies using synthetic data and BERT/LLM classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clickbait headlines threaten information credibility and user trust, but current ML detection methods lack explainability, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Created synthetic dataset by augmenting real headlines with predefined clickbait strategies. Two-stage framework: 1) Detection using fine-tuned BERT vs LLMs (GPT-4.0, Gemini 2.4 Flash) with zero/few-shot prompting, 2) BERT-based classifier for tactic attribution.

Result: Developed an explainable clickbait detection system that not only identifies manipulative content but also explains the specific linguistic strategies used, enabling transparent analysis.

Conclusion: This work advances transparent AI systems for combating manipulative media by providing both detection and explanation capabilities, with the dataset shared for community research.

Abstract: The proliferation of clickbait headlines poses significant challenges to the
credibility of information and user trust in digital media. While recent
advances in machine learning have improved the detection of manipulative
content, the lack of explainability limits their practical adoption. This paper
presents a model for explainable clickbait detection that not only identifies
clickbait titles but also attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation
strategies. We introduce a synthetic dataset generated by systematically
augmenting real news headlines using a predefined catalogue of clickbait
strategies. This dataset enables controlled experimentation and detailed
analysis of model behaviour. We present a two-stage framework for automatic
clickbait analysis comprising detection and tactic attribution. In the first
stage, we compare a fine-tuned BERT classifier with large language models
(LLMs), specifically GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash, under both zero-shot
prompting and few-shot prompting enriched with illustrative clickbait headlines
and their associated persuasive tactics. In the second stage, a dedicated
BERT-based classifier predicts the specific clickbait strategies present in
each headline. This work advances the development of transparent and
trustworthy AI systems for combating manipulative media content. We share the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoBench-Reddit is a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating multimodal emotion understanding in MLLMs, featuring 350 curated Reddit samples with images, text, and emotion categories, progressing from basic perception to advanced cognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluation benchmarks focus on objective tasks like visual QA and captioning, but fail to assess models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions, creating a gap in comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Created a dataset of 350 Reddit samples with images, user text, and emotion categories (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy). Designed hierarchical tasks with 6 multiple-choice and 1 open-ended question per sample, progressing from perception (visual elements) to cognition (scene reasoning, intent understanding, empathy). Used AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification for annotation quality.

Result: The paper introduces EmoBench-Reddit as a comprehensive benchmark that addresses the gap in evaluating multimodal emotion understanding capabilities, providing a structured framework for assessing MLLMs' emotional intelligence across different difficulty levels.

Conclusion: EmoBench-Reddit fills a critical gap in MLLM evaluation by providing a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to test multimodal emotion understanding, enabling more comprehensive assessment of models' ability to comprehend complex human emotions through both visual and textual cues.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they
have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language
tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective
visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models'
ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for
multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously
curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an
image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor,
sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task
framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with
each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended
question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's
ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while
cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy
integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a
combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fluid Benchmarking is a new adaptive evaluation approach for language models that uses item response theory and dynamic item selection to improve benchmarking efficiency, validity, and reduce variance compared to traditional static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM benchmarking faces challenges including high evaluation costs, poor measurement of intended capabilities, labeling errors, and benchmark saturation. Existing solutions address these issues in isolation rather than holistically.

Method: Fluid Benchmarking uses item response theory to estimate a model based on existing evaluation results, then dynamically selects evaluation items similar to computerized adaptive testing in education, adapting to each LM's capability level.

Result: The method outperforms random sampling and other IRT-based baselines across four dimensions - achieving higher validity and less variance on MMLU with 50x fewer items. IRT mapping increases validity while dynamic selection reduces variance.

Conclusion: LM benchmarking can be substantially improved by moving beyond static evaluation to adaptive approaches like Fluid Benchmarking that tailor evaluation to each model's capability level.

Abstract: Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive
evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended
capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and
benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to
mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation,
neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we
introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM
benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid
Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items
depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to
each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model
based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to
select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing
in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the
common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated
baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We
examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --
and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them
(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).
Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct
effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability
space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.
Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved
by moving beyond static evaluation.

Method: Created PACT dataset using LLMs with three personality profiles (Argumentation, Preference, Buying Style) for tourism negotiations. Conducted comparative experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task with multi-dimensional evaluation.

Result: Automatic and manual evaluations confirmed high-quality dialogues in PACT dataset. Fine-tuned LLMs effectively generated personality-driven rational responses during negotiations, outperforming pre-trained models.

Conclusion: PACT dataset successfully enhances personalization and reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, establishing a foundation for future research in personality-driven argumentation-based negotiation.

Abstract: Integrating argumentation mechanisms into negotiation dialogue systems
improves conflict resolution through exchanges of arguments and critiques.
Moreover, incorporating personality attributes enhances adaptability by
aligning interactions with individuals' preferences and styles. To advance
these capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, we propose a novel
Personality-driven Argumentation-based Negotiation Dialogue Generation (PAN-DG)
task. To support this task, we introduce PACT, a dataset of Personality-driven
Argumentation-based negotiation Conversations for Tourism sector. This dataset,
generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), features three distinct
personality profiles, viz. Argumentation Profile, Preference Profile, and
Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving
diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that
the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative
experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task.
Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively
generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This
underscores the effectiveness of PACT in enhancing personalization and
reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, thereby establishing a
foundation for future research in this domain.

*Hongxu Zhou,Hylke Westerdijk,Khondoker Ittehadul Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context and emotional tone metadata negatively impact LLM fallacy classification in political debates, with basic prompts often outperforming enhanced ones using theoretical frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how contextual information and emotional tone metadata affect LLM reasoning and performance in fallacy classification tasks within political debate settings.

Method: Used Qwen-3 (8B) model with U.S. presidential debate data, testing various prompting strategies including Pragma-Dialectics and Periodic Table of Arguments frameworks. Evaluated three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with context plus audio-based emotional tone metadata.

Result: Theoretical prompting improved interpretability but context and emotional tone metadata often lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biased the model toward labeling statements as Appeal to Emotion, worsening logical reasoning. Basic prompts frequently outperformed enhanced ones.

Conclusion: Attention dilution from added contextual inputs may worsen fallacy classification in LLMs rather than improve it, suggesting simpler approaches may be more effective for logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence
large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification
tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S.
presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting
strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically
grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table
of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under
three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context
and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical
prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the
addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to
lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling
statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall,
basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention
dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy
classification in LLMs.

*Shiyao Cui,Xijia Feng,Yingkang Wang,Junxiao Yang,Zhexin Zhang,Biplab Sikdar,Hongning Wang,Han Qiu,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emojis can trigger toxic content generation in LLMs across multiple languages and models, bypassing safety mechanisms through heterogeneous semantic channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observation that emojis, typically associated with friendliness, may unexpectedly induce toxic content generation in large language models, prompting investigation into the extent and mechanisms of this phenomenon.

Method: Automated construction of prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent, tested across 5 languages and 7 LLMs, with model-level interpretations including semantic cognition, sequence generation, and tokenization analysis, plus pre-training corpus probing.

Result: Prompts containing emojis easily induce toxicity generation in LLMs, with emojis acting as heterogeneous semantic channels that bypass safety mechanisms, potentially linked to emoji-related data pollution in pre-training corpora.

Conclusion: Emojis present a significant vulnerability in LLM safety mechanisms, requiring attention to mitigate their potential for triggering toxic content generation through improved safety protocols and training data curation.

Abstract: Emojis are globally used non-verbal cues in digital communication, and
extensive research has examined how large language models (LLMs) understand and
utilize emojis across contexts. While usually associated with friendliness or
playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in
LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether
emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to
interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of
emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of
prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5
mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate
that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand
this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic
cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act
as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue
deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential
correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity
generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code
and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)

*Felix Wang,Boyu Chen,Kerun Xu,Bo Tang,Feiyu Xiong,Zhiyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Mem is a unified memory operation language that provides standardized natural language to execution pathway for LLM agent memory systems, addressing limitations of existing frameworks with a formal specification and comprehensive operation set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory frameworks for LLM agents are limited, exposing only basic primitives while lacking higher-order operations and formal specifications, leading to unpredictable behavior across systems.

Method: Text2Mem defines a compact yet expressive JSON-based operation schema with required fields and semantic invariants, includes parser, validator, and adapters for SQL backends or real memory frameworks, and integrates model-based services like embeddings and summarization.

Result: The design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends through a unified execution contract, establishing standardized foundation for memory control in agents.

Conclusion: Text2Mem provides the first standardized foundation for memory operations in LLM agents, with planned Text2Mem Bench benchmark to enable systematic evaluation of memory systems.

Abstract: Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long
horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a
few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order
operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or
inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable
specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit
and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a
unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from
natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet
expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each
instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields
and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects
with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,
while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real
memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are
integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution
contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across
heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark
that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic
evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized
foundation for memory control in agents.

*Erion Çano,Ivan Habernal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP fine-tuned LLMs produce shorter, less grammatical, and less diverse texts with reduced utility in downstream tasks as privacy constraints increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of differential privacy fine-tuning on LLM output quality and utility, as this hasn't been studied despite the popularity of DP for privacy protection.

Method: Fine-tuned five LLMs with three corpora under four privacy levels, then assessed text length, grammatical correctness, lexical diversity, and utility in downstream classification tasks.

Result: Stronger privacy constraints led to texts that are 77% shorter, 9% less grammatically correct, 10% less diverse in bi-gram diversity, and reduced accuracy in classification tasks.

Conclusion: Differential privacy fine-tuning significantly degrades text quality and utility, which may limit the usefulness of synthetic data generated for privacy protection.

Abstract: Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs)
tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the
impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of
the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five
LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the
grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they
produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream
classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions
and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate
that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are
shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %,
and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the
accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might
be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.

*Hang Guo,Yawei Li,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBR is a training-free framework that combines quantization and sparsity for LLM compression by aligning their conflicting requirements through error compensation, achieving 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single compression methods (quantization/pruning) are reaching their limits, but combining them introduces conflicts - quantization prefers compact weight ranges while pruning benefits from high variance distributions.

Method: Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR) uses second-order Hessian objective with surrogate approximation and group error compensation to align pruning and quantization without training.

Result: Enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity, achieving up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to FP16-dense baseline.

Conclusion: OBR provides an effective training-free solution for joint quantization-sparsity compression, overcoming the inherent conflicts between these techniques through mathematical alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as
quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these
techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single
method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this
work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and
sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties
due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions:
quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance.
To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general
and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error
compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream
tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then
reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and
ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation.
Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50%
sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory
reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional adversarial training improves BioIE performance but introduces significant computational overhead, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Built on PubMedBERT, RAT integrates random sampling mechanisms with adversarial training principles to enhance generalization and robustness while reducing computational requirements.

Result: RAT demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: RAT offers a transformative framework for biomedical NLP that balances model performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce random adversarial training (RAT), a novel framework
successfully applied to biomedical information extraction (BioIE) tasks.
Building on PubMedBERT as the foundational architecture, our study first
validates the effectiveness of conventional adversarial training in enhancing
pre-trained language models' performance on BioIE tasks. While adversarial
training yields significant improvements across various performance metrics, it
also introduces considerable computational overhead. To address this
limitation, we propose RAT as an efficiency solution for biomedical information
extraction. This framework strategically integrates random sampling mechanisms
with adversarial training principles, achieving dual objectives: enhanced model
generalization and robustness while significantly reducing computational costs.
Through comprehensive evaluations, RAT demonstrates superior performance
compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks. The results highlight RAT's
potential as a transformative framework for biomedical natural language
processing, offering a balanced solution to the model performance and
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper distills 58 prompt engineering techniques into 6 core methods for life sciences workflows, providing actionable guidelines to improve research efficiency and quality through systematic prompting practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt engineering requires significant cognitive effort, and researchers need streamlined approaches to achieve efficiency gains in life sciences workflows that exceed the initial learning investment.

Method: The authors analyze and distill 58 text-based prompt engineering techniques to focus on 6 core methods: zero-shot, few-shot approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition. They provide detailed recommendations and address common pitfalls.

Result: The paper provides actionable guidance on prompt structuring, addresses limitations of current tools, and demonstrates how prompt engineering can augment existing data processing and document editing practices in life sciences research.

Conclusion: The research facilitates the transition from opportunistic prompting to an effective, systematic practice that contributes to higher quality research outcomes in life sciences through core prompt engineering principles.

Abstract: Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to
generate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By
deploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline
frequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve
substantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment
required to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025
outlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting
the numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable
guidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we
distil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot
approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition.
We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases
relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to
editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and
shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn
conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning
and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools
like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools
across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current
limitations. We demonstrate how prompt engineering can augment rather than
replace existing established individual practices around data processing and
document editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt
engineering principles, and to facilitate the transition from opportunistic
prompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to
higher quality research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly English-centric and lack cultural diversity, creating a need for culturally diverse benchmarks.

Method: Multi-stage filtering approach using three language models on 3.01 million web-crawled questions, followed by GPT-4o refinement and human validation to create 441 high-quality question-answer pairs with cultural grounding.

Result: Best model achieved 83.22% accuracy while weakest reached only 59.86%, with models particularly struggling with culturally specific scenarios containing traditional Korean elements.

Conclusion: Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning research, highlighting the importance of culturally diverse datasets.

Abstract: Physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly
English-centric and lack cultural diversity. We introduce Ko-PIQA, a Korean
physical commonsense reasoning dataset that incorporates cultural context.
Starting from 3.01 million web-crawled questions, we employed a multi-stage
filtering approach using three language models to identify 11,553 PIQA-style
questions. Through GPT-4o refinement and human validation, we obtained 441
high-quality question-answer pairs. A key feature of Ko-PIQA is its cultural
grounding: 19.7\% of questions contain culturally specific elements like
traditional Korean foods (kimchi), clothing (hanbok), and specialized
appliances (kimchi refrigerators) that require culturally-aware reasoning
beyond direct translation. We evaluate seven language models on Ko-PIQA, with
the best model achieving 83.22\% accuracy while the weakest reaches only
59.86\%, demonstrating significant room for improvement. Models particularly
struggle with culturally specific scenarios, highlighting the importance of
culturally diverse datasets. Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean
language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning
research. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

the Gemini 2.5 Flash model with few-shot prompting, dataset preprocessing, and
an ensemble of three prompt configurations to improve classification accuracy
on standard, biased, and fill-in-the-blank questions. For Sub-Task 2, we employ
a unified prompt with the same model, incorporating role-playing as an Arabic
medical expert, few-shot examples, and post-processing to generate concise

Motivation: To systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning approaches with and without transformers for relation extraction, and understand the impact of transformer architectures in this domain.

Method: Conducted experiments using non-transformer architectures (PA-LSTM, C-GCN, AGGCN) and transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, R-BERT) on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED datasets. Evaluated performance with micro F1 scores across different scenarios, sentence lengths, and training dataset percentages.

Result: Transformer-based models achieved significantly higher micro F1 scores (80-90%) compared to non-transformer models (64-67%), demonstrating superior performance in relation extraction tasks.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures provide substantial performance improvements over traditional non-transformer approaches in relation extraction, highlighting the importance of transformer-based models in modern NLP tasks and their dominant role in the current landscape of large language models for information extraction.

Abstract: In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an
important role in information extraction through the transformation of
unstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this
paper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning
approaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series
of non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017),
C-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019),
and a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu
and He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as
well as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and
different percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were
conducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that
transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1
scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally,
we briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification
and discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in

*Abraham Toluwase Owodunni,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA) enables adding new languages to multilingual models without retraining from scratch, using selective layer adaptation to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining existing language capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual models need expensive retraining to add new languages, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Existing mitigation strategies require original pretraining data which is often unavailable.

Method: Proposes Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA) that adds Low-Rank Adapters to selected initial and final layers while keeping intermediate layers frozen, based on insights about how multilingual models process languages across different layers.

Result: LayRA provides the best tradeoff between preserving existing language capabilities and learning new languages, outperforming approaches like standard LoRA. Also enables instruction following in target languages without instruction tuning data via model arithmetic.

Conclusion: LayRA is an effective solution for continually adding languages to multilingual models without access to original pretraining data, addressing catastrophic forgetting through selective layer adaptation.

Abstract: Multilingual language models are trained on a fixed set of languages, and to
support new languages, the models need to be retrained from scratch. This is an
expensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to
release their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued
pretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation
strategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original
pretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually
adding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining
data in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address
this problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank
Adapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of
the model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,
and (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial
layers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the
source language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple
combinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and
evaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides
the overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously
supported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as
LoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model
arithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction
following abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target
languages.

*Amirhossein Abaskohi,Raymond Li,Chuyuan Li,Shafiq Joty,Giuseppe Carenini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CEMTM is a context-enhanced multimodal topic model that processes text and images using fine-tuned LVLMs, distributional attention, and reconstruction objectives to achieve superior topic coherence and performance across six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal topic models struggle with processing multiple images efficiently while maintaining interpretability and semantic consistency across modalities, particularly for both short and long documents.

Method: Uses fine-tuned large vision language models for contextualized embeddings, distributional attention mechanism for token weighting, and reconstruction objective to align topic representations with document embeddings.

Result: Outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines on six benchmarks with average LLM score of 2.61, effective in few-shot retrieval, and captures visually grounded semantics in complex domains like scientific articles.

Conclusion: CEMTM provides an effective framework for multimodal topic modeling that handles multiple images efficiently while maintaining interpretability and achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse document types.

Abstract: We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to
infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long
documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision
language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a
distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic
inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with
the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities.
Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document
without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit
word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six
multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and
multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further
analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its
ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as
scientific articles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with hallucination and under-performance in coreference resolution tasks, particularly with QA Template and Document Template methods.

Method: Proposed two techniques: 1) Reversed Training with Joint Inference to improve QA Template method, and 2) Iterative Document Generation to eliminate hallucinations in source text generation.

Result: Reversed Training improves QA Template performance, while Iterative Document Generation eliminates hallucinations and boosts coreference resolution accuracy.

Conclusion: Integration of these methods provides an effective and robust solution for LLM-based coreference resolution.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is crucial for many NLP tasks, but existing LLMs
struggle with hallucination and under-performance. In this paper, we
investigate the limitations of existing LLM-based approaches to CR-specifically
the Question-Answering (QA) Template and Document Template methods and propose
two novel techniques: Reversed Training with Joint Inference and Iterative
Document Generation. Our experiments show that Reversed Training improves the
QA Template method, while Iterative Document Generation eliminates
hallucinations in the generated source text and boosts coreference resolution.
Integrating these methods and techniques offers an effective and robust
solution to LLM-based coreference resolution.

Result: Best-performing LLaMA model fine-tuned with LoRA achieved strong performance on English validation set but showed notable performance drop on test set, indicating generalization challenges.

Conclusion: Evidence granularity and model adaptation are crucial for robust numerical fact verification, highlighting the need for better generalization approaches in fact-checking systems.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Task 3 of the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab,
which focuses on verifying numerical and temporal claims using retrieved
evidence. We explore two complementary approaches: zero-shot prompting with
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and supervised fine-tuning using
parameter-efficient LoRA. To enhance evidence quality, we investigate several
selection strategies, including full-document input and top-k sentence
filtering using BM25 and MiniLM. Our best-performing model LLaMA fine-tuned
with LoRA achieves strong performance on the English validation set. However, a
notable drop in the test set highlights a generalization challenge. These
findings underscore the importance of evidence granularity and model adaptation

*Zhongyang Hu,Naijie Gu,Xiangzhi Tao,Tianhui Gu,Yibing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two novel approaches for ranking candidate words in lexical substitution tasks using attention weights and integrated gradients to measure bidirectional semantic influence between target words and context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for lexical substitution ranking focus only on semantic changes at target positions or require parameter tuning across multiple metrics, failing to effectively model the bidirectional influence between candidate substitutions and their context.

Method: Proposes two approaches: 1) using attention weights to measure context influence on target tokens, and 2) leveraging integrated gradients method for more interpretable measurement. Both incorporate semantic similarity between original and substituted sentences for candidate ranking.

Result: Experiments on LS07 and SWORDS datasets show that both approaches improve ranking performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The attention-based and integrated gradients approaches effectively capture bidirectional semantic influence in lexical substitution, leading to improved candidate ranking performance without extensive parameter tuning.

Abstract: A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A
common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original
sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic
differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the
bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and
its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on
semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over
multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize
semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based
on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated
gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on
the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity
between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and
SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle as overhearers in collaborative object-matching conversations, failing to improve performance across multiple rounds despite exposure to repeated interactions between the same participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding referring expressions in spontaneous conversations is crucial for embodied agents to perform real-world tasks, requiring integration of language, vision, and conversational interaction.

Method: Evaluated seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to human conversations in a collaborative object-matching task, analyzing performance across multiple rounds of the same task with the same participants.

Result: Current LVLMs find the task challenging and show no consistent performance improvement even after overhearing more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the same task.

Conclusion: The study reveals limitations in current LVLMs' ability to learn from conversational context over time, highlighting the need for improved models that can better integrate and understand language, vision, and conversational dynamics.

Abstract: During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring
expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations.
Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an
embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires
integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction.
We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between
pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative
object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current
LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they
overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the
same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for
reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates medical LLMs on Spanish medical exam questions from Peru, finding that larger models like medgemma-27b-text-it perform best (>90% accuracy), while smaller models (<10B parameters) struggle (<60%). Fine-tuning medgemma-4b-it significantly improves performance to rival much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether high-performing medical LLMs can effectively handle medical questions in Spanish from Latin America, particularly Peru, as LLM-based medical applications become more prevalent in the region.

Method: Created PeruMedQA dataset with 8,380 Spanish medical exam questions from Peru (2018-2025), tested 8 medical LLMs using zero-shot prompts, and fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it using PEFT and LoRA techniques.

Result: medgemma-27b-text-it (27B parameters) achieved >90% accuracy, while smaller models (<10B parameters) scored <60%. Fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it outperformed all smaller models and rivaled a 70B parameter model.

Conclusion: For Spanish medical AI applications in countries with similar epidemiological profiles to Peru, medgemma-27b-text-it or fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it should be used due to their superior performance on Latin American medical content.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which
this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from
a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as
LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a
dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians
pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate
and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the
fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice
question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12
medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including
medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific
prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient
fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it
utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:
medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of
correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion
parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results
<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all
LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters
across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and
research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those
exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties
should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.

*Zhihan Cao,Hiroaki Yamada,Takenobu Tokunaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Antonymy shows distinctive co-occurrence patterns with high strength, preferred linear order, and short spans compared to other semantic relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text, but it was unclear if this pattern is distinctive to antonymy due to lack of comparison with other semantic relations.

Method: Compared antonymy with three other semantic relations across parts of speech using robust co-occurrence metrics.

Result: Antonymy is distinctive in three respects: high co-occurrence strength, preferred linear order, and short span distances.

Conclusion: Antonymy has unique co-occurrence characteristics that distinguish it from other semantic relations, with all results available online.

Abstract: Antonymy has long received particular attention in lexical semantics.
Previous studies have shown that antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text,
across genres and parts of speech, more often than would be expected by chance.
However, whether this co-occurrence pattern is distinctive of antonymy remains
unclear, due to a lack of comparison with other semantic relations. This work
fills the gap by comparing antonymy with three other relations across parts of
speech using robust co-occurrence metrics. We find that antonymy is distinctive
in three respects: antonym pairs co-occur with high strength, in a preferred
linear order, and within short spans. All results are available online.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HARP is a novel hallucination detection framework that decomposes LLM hidden states into semantic and reasoning subspaces using SVD on the unembedding layer, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 92.8% AUROC on TriviaQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness, posing barriers to reliable LLM use in critical decision-making.

Method: HARP decomposes LLM hidden state space into semantic and reasoning subspaces, uses SVD on unembedding layer parameters to obtain basis vectors, and projects hidden states onto reasoning subspace for detection features.

Result: HARP reduces feature dimension to ~5% of original, filters noise, and achieves 92.8% AUROC on TriviaQA, outperforming previous best method by 7.5% across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: HARP provides an effective framework for hallucination detection by leveraging reasoning subspace projection, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their
reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination
detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with
disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To
address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via
reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP
establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct
sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes
linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these
subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its
parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are
obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the
reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input
features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP
reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,
filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on
TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality due to evidence sparsity, creating a need for better evaluation tools.

Method: Proposed HiCBench with manually annotated multi-level chunking points and synthesized evidence-dense QA pairs, plus HiChunk framework using fine-tuned LLMs and Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm.

Result: HiCBench effectively evaluates different chunking methods across the RAG pipeline, and HiChunk achieves better chunking quality with reasonable time consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and framework successfully address document chunking evaluation challenges and improve overall RAG system performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of
language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document
chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation
tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are
inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to
evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which
includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized
evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence
sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level
document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the
Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments
demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different
chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves
better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing
the overall performance of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D²HScore is a training-free hallucination detection framework that analyzes intra-layer dispersion and inter-layer drift of token representations during LLM inference, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM hallucination hinders practical applications in high-stakes domains. Existing approaches lack comprehensive analysis of model architecture and generation dynamics for reliable detection.

Method: Proposes D²HScore framework that measures: 1) Intra-Layer Dispersion - semantic diversity within each layer, 2) Inter-Layer Drift - progressive transformation of key tokens across layers using attention-guided token selection.

Result: Extensive experiments across five open-source LLMs and five benchmarks show D²HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides an interpretable, lightweight proxy for hallucination detection by capturing both horizontal and vertical representation dynamics during inference.

Abstract: Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual
content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'
outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as
finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination
detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.
Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of
LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the
semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic
depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we
propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},
a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)
\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of
token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},
which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across
layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather
than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention
signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of
representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and
lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across
five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have advanced English NLP but overlooked low-resource South Asian languages (650+ languages), creating a need to assess current capabilities and challenges to inform the community and facilitate development.

Method: Comprehensive examination of studies since 2020, focusing on transformer-based models (BERT, T5, GPT) across three aspects: data, models, and tasks including data sources, fine-tuning strategies, and domain applications.

Result: Identified substantial issues including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing challenges, and lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks tailored to South Asian linguistic and cultural nuances.

Conclusion: The survey aims to raise awareness for targeted data curation, unify benchmarks, and encourage equitable representation of South Asian languages in NLP development to address current gaps and limitations.

Abstract: Rapid developments of large language models have revolutionized many NLP
tasks for English data. Unfortunately, the models and their evaluations for
low-resource languages are being overlooked, especially for languages in South
Asia. Although there are more than 650 languages in South Asia, many of them
either have very limited computational resources or are missing from existing
language models. Thus, a concrete question to be answered is: Can we assess the
current stage and challenges to inform our NLP community and facilitate model
developments for South Asian languages? In this survey, we have comprehensively
examined current efforts and challenges of NLP models for South Asian languages
by retrieving studies since 2020, with a focus on transformer-based models,
such as BERT, T5, & GPT. We present advances and gaps across 3 essential
aspects: data, models, & tasks, such as available data sources, fine-tuning
strategies, & domain applications. Our findings highlight substantial issues,
including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing, and
lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Our survey aims to raise awareness
within the NLP community for more targeted data curation, unify benchmarks
tailored to cultural and linguistic nuances of South Asia, and encourage an
equitable representation of South Asian languages. The complete list of

TL;DR: Analysis of 7,077 user interactions with TALKA AI chatbot shows how generative AI supports Hakka language learning through cognitive engagement and dialogue acts, aiding language preservation and cultural connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address endangered language preservation by examining how generative AI chatbots can support language learning and cultural engagement, particularly for low-resource languages like Hakka.

Method: Dual-layered analytical framework combining Bloom's Taxonomy (6 cognitive levels) and dialogue act categorization (11 types) applied to 7,077 annotated user utterances from TALKA chatbot interactions.

Result: Generative AI chatbots effectively support language learning by facilitating various cognitive processes and dialogue functions including information requests, translations, cultural inquiries, and creative language use, while promoting confidence and cultural identity.

Conclusion: AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive development, pragmatic negotiation, and socio-cultural affiliation in language learners, offering valuable insights for technology-supported language preservation and educational practices.

Abstract: With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve
them now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed
teaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative
AI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a
dual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive
processes and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,
each carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue
act types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for
information, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using
language creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different
types of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social
greetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that
generative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful
ways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users
think and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more
confidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides
empirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive
development in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation
and socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning,
this study offers new insights into how technology can support language
preservation and educational practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpanEIT is a novel framework for entity-level sentiment classification that integrates dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms to better model entity-sentiment relationships and ensure consistency across document mentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity-level sentiment classification faces challenges in modeling complex entity-sentiment interactions, capturing cross-sentence dependencies, ensuring consistency across entity mentions, and handling linguistic phenomena like negation and ambiguity in noisy real-world text.

Method: Proposes SpanEIT framework with span-based representations for entities and sentiment phrases, bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, graph attention network for syntactic and co-occurrence relations, and coreference-aware memory module for entity-level consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets in both accuracy and F1 scores. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: SpanEIT demonstrates strong potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis, with validated effectiveness through interpretability analyses.

Abstract: Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment
polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several
challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between
entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies
that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions
for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution.
Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping
opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level
sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy
textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework
integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for
enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based
representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs
bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph
attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A
coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across
documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT
outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and
F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of
our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in
applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

Result: HalluDetect achieved 69% F1 score (25.44% improvement over baselines). AgentBot minimized hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn with 96.13% token accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy in LLMs, providing a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation that generalizes to high-risk domains beyond consumer law.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in industry but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting their reliability in critical applications. This work
addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using
LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop
HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1
score of 69% outperforming baseline detectors by 25.44%. Benchmarking five
chatbot architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes
hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy
(96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings
provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that
optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy.
While applied to consumer law, our approach generalizes to other high-risk
domains, enhancing trust in LLM-driven assistants. We will release the code and
dataset

### [58] [AesBiasBench: Evaluating Bias and Alignment in Multimodal Language Models for Personalized Image Aesthetic Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11620)
*Kun Li,Lai-Man Po,Hongzheng Yang,Xuyuan Xu,Kangcheng Liu,Yuzhi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AesBiasBench benchmark evaluates MLLMs for stereotype bias and human alignment in personalized image aesthetic assessment, finding smaller models show more bias while larger models align better with humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are increasingly used for personalized image aesthetic assessment but may reflect demographic biases in gender, age, and education that need systematic evaluation.

Method: Proposed AesBiasBench benchmark with three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to evaluate 19 MLLMs including proprietary and open-source models.

Result: Smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases, larger models align more closely with human preferences, and incorporating identity information often exacerbates bias, especially in emotional judgments.

Conclusion: Identity-aware evaluation frameworks are crucial for subjective vision-language tasks to address demographic biases in MLLM aesthetic assessments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
Personalized Image Aesthetic Assessment (PIAA) as a scalable alternative to
expert evaluations. However, their predictions may reflect subtle biases
influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, and education. In this
work, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two
complementary dimensions: (1) stereotype bias, quantified by measuring
variations in aesthetic evaluations across demographic groups; and (2)
alignment between model outputs and genuine human aesthetic preferences. Our
benchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and
introduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and
alignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).
Results indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,
whereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating
identity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional
judgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware
evaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks.

*Sai Kartheek Reddy Kasu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EthicsMH is a new 125-scenario dataset for evaluating AI ethical reasoning in mental health contexts, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks for sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas in mental health practice where confidentiality, autonomy, beneficence, and bias intersect.

Method: Created a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios with structured fields including decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints.

Result: Developed EthicsMH dataset that enables evaluation of decision accuracy, explanation quality, and alignment with professional norms in mental health contexts.

Conclusion: EthicsMH provides a foundational resource for community expansion to foster development of AI systems capable of handling sensitive mental health decisions responsibly.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other
sensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness,
and responsible alignment. Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical
decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas
encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy,
beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce
Ethical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios
designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in
therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured
fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected
model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This
structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of
explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in
scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task
framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By
releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded
through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI
systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate
decisions.

*Di Jin,Jun Yang,Xiaobao Wang,Junwei Zhang,Shuqi Li,Dongxiao He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DYNAMO is a fake news detection model that uses knowledge graphs and Monte Carlo Tree Search to dynamically update knowledge and verify news authenticity through step-by-step decomposition and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of internet and social media makes distinguishing credible news challenging. News authenticity labels can shift as events develop, requiring latest event updates. Existing retrieval-augmented methods suffer from insufficient credibility of retrieved content and noise interference.

Method: Constructs news-domain-specific knowledge graph, uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify step by step, extracts and updates new knowledge from verified real news texts and reasoning paths, integrates with large language models for dual functions of detection and verification.

Result: DYNAMO achieves the best performance on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses key problems of ensuring new knowledge authenticity and deeply mining news semantics through dynamic knowledge updates and verification mechanisms.

Abstract: As the Internet and social media evolve rapidly, distinguishing credible news
from a vast amount of complex information poses a significant challenge. Due to
the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news
can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news
detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ
retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from
issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference
from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for
fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve
continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models
to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new
knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the
authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,
we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte
Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.
Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and
reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best
performance on two real-world datasets.

*Wei-Hsin Yeh,Yu-An Su,Chih-Ning Chen,Yi-Hsueh Lin,Calvin Ku,Wen-Hsin Chiu,Min-Chun Hu,Lun-Wei Ku*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoachMe is a reference-based model that analyzes differences between learner's motion and reference motions to provide precise sport-specific instructions, outperforming GPT-4o by significant margins in figure skating and boxing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion instruction is crucial for athletes to refine techniques, but generating precise sport-specific guidance remains challenging due to the domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative feedback.

Method: CoachMe analyzes differences between learner's motion and reference motions under temporal and physical aspects, enabling domain-knowledge learning and coach-like thinking process to identify movement errors effectively.

Result: CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on boxing, providing high-quality instructions that elaborate on errors and improvement methods.

Conclusion: CoachMe effectively adapts to specific sports by learning from general movements and leveraging limited data, providing precise sport-specific motion instructions with detailed error analysis and improvement guidance.

Abstract: Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their
technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although
recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,
generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to
the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative
guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the
differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and
physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the
acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors
effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we
illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and
boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.
Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of
directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.
CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on
boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their
corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find

*Robert Einig,Stefan Janscha,Jonas Schuster,Julian Koch,Martin Hagmueller,Barbara Schuppler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This pilot study examines whether acoustic improvements in a seminar room enhance communication quality in hybrid meetings, finding positive results despite small sample size limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of hybrid meetings since COVID-19, room acoustics are often overlooked despite their critical impact on communication quality, speech intelligibility, and participant fatigue.

Method: Recorded two groups of participants twice - before and after acoustic improvements in a seminar room at Graz University of Technology, comparing communication outcomes.

Result: Findings indicate that room acoustic interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings, though results did not reach statistical significance due to small sample size.

Conclusion: Acoustic design interventions support better communication in hybrid meeting spaces, highlighting the importance of considering room acoustics alongside technical infrastructure like internet connectivity.

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities and companies have
increasingly integrated hybrid features into their meeting spaces, or even
created dedicated rooms for this purpose. While the importance of a fast and
stable internet connection is often prioritized, the acoustic design of seminar
rooms is frequently overlooked. Poor acoustics, particularly excessive
reverberation, can lead to issues such as misunderstandings, reduced speech
intelligibility or cognitive and vocal fatigue. This pilot study investigates
whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of
Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose,
we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving
the acoustics of the room. Our findings -- despite not reaching statistical
significance due to the small sample size - indicate clearly that our spatial
interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings. To make the
paper accessible also for readers from the speech communication community, we
explain room acoustics background, relevant for the interpretation of our
results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A stateful agentic system for extracting key-value pairs from diverse Declaration of Performance documents using planner-executor-responder architecture to handle structural variations and prevent hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Declaration of Performance documents vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format, making automated extraction challenging. Existing static or LLM-only pipelines often hallucinate and fail to adapt to this structural diversity.

Method: Domain-specific stateful agentic system with planner-executor-responder architecture that infers user intent, detects document modality, and orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding tool misuse or execution loops.

Result: Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages.

Conclusion: The system offers a scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows, addressing challenges of diverse document structures in construction product certification.

Abstract: Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents, mandated by EU regulation,
certify the performance of construction products. While some of their content
is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format,
posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question
answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and
fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful
agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder
architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and
orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding
tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset
demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a
scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UXPID dataset provides 7130 synthetic user feedback threads from industrial forums, annotated with UX insights using LLMs to enable AI-driven analysis of technical customer feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial forums contain valuable but unstructured customer feedback that traditional methods struggle to analyze due to domain-specific vocabulary and lack of structure, limiting insights for product development.

Method: Created UXPID dataset with 7130 artificially synthesized user feedback threads from industrial automation forums, using LLMs to systematically annotate each JSON record for UX insights, sentiment, severity, and topic classifications.

Result: A structured dataset enabling research in user requirements analysis, UX evaluation, and AI-driven feedback processing, particularly useful where privacy restrictions limit real data access.

Conclusion: UXPID facilitates training transformer models for technical forum analysis tasks like issue detection and sentiment analysis, addressing the challenge of unstructured domain-specific customer feedback.

Abstract: Customer feedback in industrial forums reflect a rich but underexplored
source of insight into real-world product experience. These publicly shared
discussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and
success stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this
information for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured
and domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and
specialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis
techniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,
thereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support
strategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User
eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130
artificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a
public industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)
record contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software
products, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a
large language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and
annotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,
and topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research
in user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback
processing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access
to real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of
transformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis,
and requirements extraction in the context of technical forums.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions from online forums, labeled for clinical criticality, and benchmarks both traditional ML classifiers and LLM-based approaches for detecting critical health questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online medical forums contain valuable but underutilized patient insights about medication concerns. Detecting critical questions that may signal confusion, misuse, or early warning signs of health crises is vital for timely intervention and patient safety.

Method: Created a manually annotated dataset of medication-related questions labeled by clinical risk factors. Benchmarked six traditional ML classifiers using TF-IDF representations against three state-of-the-art LLM-based classification approaches leveraging deep contextual understanding.

Result: The study demonstrates the potential of both classical machine learning methods and modern LLM approaches to support real-time triage and alert systems in digital health spaces for detecting critical medication-related questions.

Conclusion: The curated dataset is made publicly available to encourage further research at the intersection of patient-generated data, NLP, and early warning systems for critical health events, highlighting the value of automated detection systems for medication safety.

Abstract: Online medical forums are a rich and underutilized source of insight into
patient concerns, especially regarding medication use. Some of the many
questions users pose may signal confusion, misuse, or even the early warning
signs of a developing health crisis. Detecting these critical questions that
may precede severe adverse events or life-threatening complications is vital
for timely intervention and improving patient safety. This study introduces a
novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions extracted from online
forums. Each entry is manually labelled for criticality based on clinical risk
factors. We benchmark the performance of six traditional machine learning
classifiers using TF-IDF textual representations, alongside three
state-of-the-art large language model (LLM)-based classification approaches
that leverage deep contextual understanding. Our results highlight the
potential of classical and modern methods to support real-time triage and alert
systems in digital health spaces. The curated dataset is made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks use clean clinical text, but real patient descriptions are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy, raising concerns about LLMs' diagnostic capabilities in realistic healthcare settings.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset with clinically consistent scenarios annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, featuring varying levels of linguistic noise. Fine-tuned and evaluated BERT-based and T5 models on this benchmark.

Result: Developed the NDB benchmark to stress-test LLM diagnostic capabilities under realistic linguistic conditions. The dataset spans communication clarity spectrum to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles.

Conclusion: The NDB benchmark addresses the gap in evaluating LLMs on noisy patient narratives and is released to support reproducibility and future research in healthcare AI diagnostics.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare raises
critical questions about their ability to interpret patient-generated
narratives, which are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy. Existing benchmarks
typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight
into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a
novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions
characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and
layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios
annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication
clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark,
we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including
BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future
research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify pledge verification as document classification, ignoring its dynamic, temporal and multi-document characteristics that require reasoning over incremental evidence from multiple updated sources.

Method: Three core components: (1) multi-step evidence retrieval module, (2) timeline construction module, and (3) fulfilment filtering module, which together capture the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and produce interpretable structured timelines.

Result: Evaluated in collaboration with professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification effort.

Conclusion: PledgeTracker successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a structured approach to pledge verification that accounts for temporal evolution and multiple evidence sources, making it practical for real-world fact-checking applications.

Abstract: Political pledges reflect candidates' policy commitments, but tracking their
fulfilment requires reasoning over incremental evidence distributed across
multiple, dynamically updated sources. Existing methods simplify this task into
a document classification task, overlooking its dynamic, temporal and
multi-document nature. To address this issue, we introduce
\textsc{PledgeTracker}, a system that reformulates pledge verification into
structured event timeline construction. PledgeTracker consists of three core
components: (1) a multi-step evidence retrieval module; (2) a timeline
construction module and; (3) a fulfilment filtering module, allowing the
capture of the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and producing interpretable
and structured timelines. We evaluate PledgeTracker in collaboration with
professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating its
effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification
effort.

*Taichi Aida,Danushka Bollegala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCDTour is a method that orders and merges interpretable axes to maintain both high interpretability and performance in semantic change detection, achieving comparable results to full-dimensional embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a trade-off problem in Semantic Change Detection where improving interpretability reduces performance and vice versa. Current methods struggle to balance both aspects effectively.

Method: SCDTour orders and merges interpretable axes based on (a) semantic similarity between axes in embedding space and (b) each axis's contribution to semantic change. It agglomerates sorted axes to produce refined word senses.

Result: Experimental results show SCDTour preserves semantic change detection performance while maintaining high interpretability. The refined axes achieve comparable or improved performance against original full-dimensional embeddings.

Conclusion: SCDTour effectively balances interpretability and performance in semantic change detection, enabling meaningful interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

Abstract: In Semantic Change Detection (SCD), it is a common problem to obtain
embeddings that are both interpretable and high-performing. However, improving
interpretability often leads to a loss in the SCD performance, and vice versa.
To address this problem, we propose SCDTour, a method that orders and merges
interpretable axes to alleviate the performance degradation of SCD. SCDTour
considers both (a) semantic similarity between axes in the embedding space, as
well as (b) the degree to which each axis contributes to semantic change.
Experimental results show that SCDTour preserves performance in semantic change
detection while maintaining high interpretability. Moreover, agglomerating the
sorted axes produces a more refined set of word senses, which achieves
comparable or improved performance against the original full-dimensional
embeddings in the SCD task. These findings demonstrate that SCDTour effectively
balances interpretability and SCD performance, enabling meaningful
interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

TL;DR: MOOM is a dual-branch memory plugin for ultra-long dialogues that models plot development and character portrayal with a forgetting mechanism to control memory growth, outperforming existing methods with fewer LLM calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory extraction methods for human-robot role-playing dialogues suffer from uncontrolled memory growth, which hinders coherent ultra-long dialogue maintenance.

Method: Proposes MOOM - a dual-branch memory plugin using literary theory: one branch summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales, another extracts user's character profile, plus a forgetting mechanism based on competition-inhibition memory theory.

Result: MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction methods, requires fewer large language model invocations, and maintains controllable memory capacity. Also presents ZH-4O dataset with 600-turn average dialogues and manual memory annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed MOOM framework effectively addresses uncontrolled memory growth in ultra-long role-playing dialogues through literary theory-inspired dual-branch modeling and forgetting mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Memory extraction is crucial for maintaining coherent ultra-long dialogues in
human-robot role-playing scenarios. However, existing methods often exhibit
uncontrolled memory growth. To address this, we propose MOOM, the first
dual-branch memory plugin that leverages literary theory by modeling plot
development and character portrayal as core storytelling elements.
Specifically, one branch summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales,
while the other extracts the user's character profile. MOOM further integrates
a forgetting mechanism, inspired by the ``competition-inhibition'' memory
theory, to constrain memory capacity and mitigate uncontrolled growth.
Furthermore, we present ZH-4O, a Chinese ultra-long dialogue dataset
specifically designed for role-playing, featuring dialogues that average 600
turns and include manually annotated memory information. Experimental results
demonstrate that MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction
methods, requiring fewer large language model invocations while maintaining a
controllable memory capacity.

TL;DR: PerspAct system integrates ReAct paradigm with LLMs to simulate developmental perspective taking stages. GPT produces developmentally-consistent narratives but shifts to advanced stages during interaction, with higher stages improving collaborative effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few computational models address both language and embodied perspective taking simultaneously, which are essential for human collaboration. The work aims to integrate these aspects using LLMs to model developmental dynamics.

Method: Uses PerspAct system combining ReAct paradigm with LLMs, evaluated through extended director task. Assesses GPT's ability to generate developmentally-aligned narratives and their impact on collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and quantitatively (task efficiency).

Result: GPT reliably produces developmentally-consistent narratives before execution but often shifts towards more advanced stages during interaction. Higher developmental stages generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more variable outcomes in complex contexts.

Conclusion: Language exchanges help refine internal representations in LLMs. Integrating embodied perspective taking and language shows potential for better modeling developmental dynamics, emphasizing the importance of evaluating internal speech during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

Abstract: Language and embodied perspective taking are essential for human
collaboration, yet few computational models address both simultaneously. This
work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason
and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental
stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an
extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal
narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these
influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and
quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces
developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts
towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language
exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages
generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more
variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential
of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model
developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech
during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

### [71] [Uncertainty in Authorship: Why Perfect AI Detection Is Mathematically Impossible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11915)
*Aadil Gani Ganie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper draws a quantum uncertainty parallel to AI-text detection, arguing that perfect detection is theoretically impossible when AI mimics human writing well, due to inherent trade-offs between detection accuracy and text authenticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs advance and AI-generated text becomes indistinguishable from human writing, there's a growing need to understand the fundamental limits of authorship detection methods and the inherent tensions in this process.

Method: The paper establishes a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty principles and authorship detection, analyzing current methods (stylometry, watermarking, neural classifiers) and their inherent limitations through theoretical analysis.

Result: Analysis shows that enhancing detection accuracy often alters AI output, making other features unreliable, and perfect detection becomes theoretically impossible when AI text closely mimics human writing.

Conclusion: The AI-text detection challenge reflects a deeper, unavoidable tension in language nature itself, not just a technological problem requiring better tools, with significant implications for authorship, ethics, and policy.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly
difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This
paper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of
authorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental
trade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was
written by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural
flow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and
disturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection
methods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face
inherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in
the AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act
of trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text.
Our analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing,
perfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically
impossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications
for authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge
of AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a
deeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in multilingual communication, it's important to understand whether they can support culturally appropriate communication beyond literal translation accuracy.

Method: Mixed-methods study analyzing English-Japanese workplace email translations with three prompting strategies: naive translation, audience-targeted prompts, and instructional prompts with explicit cultural guidance. Evaluated culture-specific language patterns and native speaker perceptions of tone appropriateness.

Result: Culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit in translations, suggesting that explicit cultural guidance helps LLMs produce more culturally appropriate communication.

Conclusion: The study provides recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual settings, emphasizing the importance of culturally-aware prompting strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday communication,
including multilingual interactions across different cultural contexts. While
LLMs can now generate near-perfect literal translations, it remains unclear
whether LLMs support culturally appropriate communication. In this paper, we
analyze the cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs when applied to
English-Japanese translations of workplace e-mails. Here, we vary the prompting
strategies: (1) naive "just translate" prompts, (2) audience-targeted prompts
specifying the recipient's cultural background, and (3) instructional prompts
with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Using a mixed-methods
study, we then analyze culture-specific language patterns to evaluate how well
translations adapt to cultural norms. Further, we examine the appropriateness
of the tone of the translations as perceived by native speakers. We find that
culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit, based on which we offer
recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual
settings.

*Mingxiao Huo,Jiayi Zhang,Hewei Wang,Jinfeng Xu,Zheyu Chen,Huilin Tai,Yijun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spec-LLaVA accelerates vision-language models using speculative decoding with a lightweight draft model and dynamic tree-based verification, achieving 3.28× faster inference without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from slow autoregressive inference, limiting real-time deployment in practical applications.

Method: Uses speculative decoding with a lightweight draft VLM and large target model, employing dynamic tree-based verification that adaptively expands/prunes speculative branches based on draft confidence.

Result: Achieves up to 3.28× faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5 (7B, 13B) models on MS COCO out-of-domain images with no generation quality loss.

Conclusion: Presents a lossless acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative decoding, enabling practical real-time multimodal assistants with resource-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multimodal reasoning but suffer
from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time
applications. We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative
decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA
pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates
future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens
to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic
tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes
speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain
images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5
(7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless
acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative
decoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants.
Importantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to
resource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FC-RewardBench benchmark reveals current reward models fail to properly evaluate tool use in LLMs. Proposed outcome-based training framework using open-weight LLM data produces models that outperform general baselines by up to 25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models trained on natural language outputs struggle to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution, creating a critical gap as LLMs increasingly interact with external tools.

Method: Introduce FC-RewardBench benchmark, then propose training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized from permissively licensed open-weight LLMs. Train models from 1.7B to 14B parameters.

Result: Trained models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines across seven out-of-domain benchmarks, achieving up to 25% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

Conclusion: Domain-specific reward modeling is essential for effective tool use evaluation, and the proposed outcome-based approach significantly improves performance over general-purpose reward models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with external tools,
reward modeling for tool use has become a critical yet underexplored area.
Existing reward models, trained primarily on natural language outputs, struggle
to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. To quantify this gap, we
introduce FC-RewardBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically assess
reward models' performance in tool-calling scenarios. Our analysis shows that
current reward models often miss key signals of effective tool use,
highlighting the need for domain-specific modeling. To address this, we propose
a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized
from permissively licensed, open-weight LLMs. We train models ranging from 1.7B
to 14B parameters and evaluate them across seven out-of-domain benchmarks.
These models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to
25\% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling
data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

TL;DR: A multi-bias framework for query-focused summarization that bridges linguistic gaps between queries and documents, with specialized approaches for sentiment explanation through sentiment biases and query expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve productivity in analyzing client feedback by automatically determining causes of sentiment from large text documents through better query-focused summarization.

Method: Proposed a multi-bias framework to address linguistic dissonance between queries and source documents, with specialized sentiment-based biases and query expansion techniques for sentiment explanation tasks.

Result: Achieved experimental results that outperform baseline models on a real-world proprietary sentiment-aware query-focused summarization dataset.

Conclusion: The multi-bias framework effectively bridges the gap between queries and documents in query-focused summarization, particularly for sentiment analysis tasks, demonstrating improved performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Constructive analysis of feedback from clients often requires determining the
cause of their sentiment from a substantial amount of text documents. To assist
and improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of
Query-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the
linguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose
and substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a
domain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for
the problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query
expansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a
real-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset.

*Alina Klerings,Jannik Brinkmann,Daniel Ruffinelli,Simone Ponzetto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs internally encode syntactic knowledge of verb tense and aspect, identifies orthogonal control directions for these features, and explores effective steering parameters to minimize side effects during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models internally represent multidimensional hierarchical grammar phenomena like verb tense and aspect, moving beyond binary grammatical contrasts studied in prior work.

Method: Used linear discriminant analysis to identify distinct, orthogonal directions in residual space for verb tense and aspect. Demonstrated causal control through concept steering across three generation tasks, and investigated steering parameters (strength, location, duration) in multi-token generation.

Result: Found that models encode tense and aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways. Identified that steering strength, location, and duration are crucial parameters for reducing undesirable side effects such as topic shift and degeneration during generation.

Conclusion: While LLMs encode grammatical features in human-like structural patterns, effective control of these features during generation requires careful parameter tuning (either manual or automated optimization) due to sensitivity to multiple factors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are able to generate grammatically well-formed
text, but how do they encode their syntactic knowledge internally? While prior
work has focused largely on binary grammatical contrasts, in this work, we
study the representation and control of two multidimensional hierarchical
grammar phenomena - verb tense and aspect - and for each, identify distinct,
orthogonal directions in residual space using linear discriminant analysis.
Next, we demonstrate causal control over both grammatical features through
concept steering across three generation tasks. Then, we use these identified
features in a case study to investigate factors influencing effective steering
in multi-token generation. We find that steering strength, location, and
duration are crucial parameters for reducing undesirable side effects such as
topic shift and degeneration. Our findings suggest that models encode tense and
aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways, but effective control of
such features during generation is sensitive to multiple factors and requires
manual tuning or automated optimization.

TL;DR: SENSE is an open-source multilingual speech-text alignment model that improves upon SAMU-XLSR with better teacher models and speech encoders, achieving competitive performance on semantic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an improved multilingual speech-text alignment framework that can capture semantics across different languages and modalities, building upon existing teacher-student approaches like SAMU-XLSR.

Method: Uses a teacher-student framework to align self-supervised speech encoder with language-agnostic text encoder representations. Updated SAMU-XLSR by selecting stronger teacher text model and better initial speech encoder.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance on multilingual and multimodal semantic tasks. The model has been integrated into SpeechBrain toolkit and publicly released.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into how semantics are captured in semantically aligned speech encoders and offers an open-source solution for multilingual speech-text alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt),
an open-source solution inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and conceptually
similar to Meta AI's SONAR models. These approaches rely on a teacher-student
framework to align a self-supervised speech encoder with the language-agnostic
continuous representations of a text encoder at the utterance level. We
describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a
stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source
code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the
SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly
released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal
semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance.
Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such
semantically aligned speech encoders.

*Payam Latifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform traditional NLP tools in NER tasks, especially for context-sensitive entities like person names, with Gemini achieving the highest F1-score, while traditional tools like Stanza show better consistency for structured tags like locations and dates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of traditional NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) versus large language models (Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen) in Named Entity Recognition tasks across different entity types.

Method: Created a manually annotated benchmark dataset of 119 tokens covering 5 entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME), evaluated six systems using F1-score against gold standard annotations.

Result: LLMs generally outperformed conventional tools, particularly for context-sensitive entities like person names. Gemini achieved the highest average F1-score. Traditional systems like Stanza showed greater consistency for structured tags (LOCATION, DATE). Variability observed among LLMs in handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations.

Conclusion: While LLMs offer improved contextual understanding in NER tasks, traditional NLP tools remain competitive for specific structured entity types, providing valuable insights for model selection based on task requirements.

Abstract: This pilot study presents a small-scale but carefully annotated benchmark of
Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance across six systems: three non-LLM
NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three general-purpose large language models
(LLMs: Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B). The dataset contains 119
tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME).
We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard
dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform
conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names,
with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional
systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as
LOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in
handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings
highlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional
tools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.

TL;DR: Domain-specific self-supervised pre-training on ATC data significantly improves ASR performance over general speech models, with streaming approaches enabling low-latency real-time processing for aviation safety applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy and efficiency in Air Traffic Control environments by leveraging domain-specific self-supervised learning rather than relying on general-purpose speech models.

Method: Train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then fine-tune on supervised ATC data. Implement chunked attention and dynamic convolutions for real-time streaming ASR with low latency.

Result: Domain-adapted pre-training substantially reduces word error rates on ATC benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art general speech encoders (w2v-BERT 2.0, HuBERT). Streaming approach further improves performance under tight latency constraints.

Conclusion: Specializing SSL representations for ATC data is an effective approach for developing more accurate and efficient ASR systems suitable for safety-critical aviation operational settings.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised
pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC)
environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then
fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we
propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency
inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art,
general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show
that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard
ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models
trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach
further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it
particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings
highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical
path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational
settings.

TL;DR: GTA framework combines supervised fine-tuning efficiency with reinforcement learning capabilities through a guess-think-answer process, achieving faster convergence and higher performance than pure SFT or RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the efficiency-capability trade-off between pure RL methods (slow convergence, inefficient exploration) and SFT methods (limited performance ceiling, weaker theoretical foundation) in NLP tasks.

Method: Proposes Guess-Think-Answer framework: model produces provisional guess (optimized via cross-entropy loss), reflects on it, then generates final answer with RL rewards shaping both output and structure format. Uses loss masking and gradient constraints to mitigate training signal conflicts.

Result: Substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming both standalone SFT and RL baselines on four text classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTA successfully combines the efficiency of supervised learning with the capability gains of reinforcement learning in a unified training paradigm, achieving superior performance and faster training convergence.

Abstract: In natural language processing tasks, pure reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and slow
convergence; while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, although efficient in
training, have limited performance ceiling and less solid theoretical
foundation compared to RL. To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we
propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of
SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works
by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via
cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final
answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the
entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence
than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient
conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient
constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks
demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming
both standalone SFT and RL baselines.

TL;DR: CBP-Tuning enables efficient local customization of black-box LLMs without exposing sensitive data or requiring model weights, using server-trained prompt generation and client-side gradient-free optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high costs and privacy limitations of customizing cloud-based LLMs, enabling personalized adaptation while preserving bidirectional privacy.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) server-side prompt generator for domain-specific capabilities, (2) client-side gradient-free optimization to tailor soft prompts for individual tasks using only a single customized vector.

Result: Superior performance in commonsense reasoning, medical and financial domains compared to baselines, demonstrating effective task-agnostic processing and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: CBP-Tuning provides an effective solution for privacy-preserving LLM customization that eliminates the need for model weight access or data upload while achieving strong adaptation performance.

Abstract: The high costs of customizing large language models (LLMs) fundamentally
limit their adaptability to user-specific needs. Consequently, LLMs are
increasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces
critical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization
at scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To
address this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning
(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization
while preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage
framework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture
domain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free
optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach
eliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,
requiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective
adaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense
reasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior
performance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic
processing and privacy preservation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XplaiNLP's submission to CheckThat! 2025 used supervised fine-tuning of transformer models and zero-shot LLM prompting for multilingual subjectivity detection, achieving top results in Italian and competitive performance in several languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective approaches for multilingual subjectivity detection across different languages, addressing challenges in cross-lingual generalization particularly for low-resource scenarios.

Method: Two main approaches: (1) Supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders (EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, German-BERT) on monolingual and machine-translated data; (2) Zero-shot prompting using LLMs (o3-mini for rule-based labeling, gpt-4.1-mini for contrastive rewriting and comparative reasoning).

Result: Achieved 1st place in Italian monolingual subtask (F1=0.8104 vs baseline 0.6941). XLM-RoBERTa ranked 3rd in Romanian zero-shot (F1=0.7917 vs baseline 0.6461). Reliable multilingual performance with improvements in Greek. Competitive German performance using translated data. Performance below baseline in Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: Transformer fine-tuning and LLM prompting are effective for multilingual subjectivity detection, though cross-lingual generalization remains challenging for low-resource languages. The approaches show strong performance in several languages while highlighting limitations in zero-shot scenarios for certain linguistic contexts.

Abstract: This notebook reports the XplaiNLP submission to the CheckThat! 2025 shared
task on multilingual subjectivity detection. We evaluate two approaches: (1)
supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders, EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and
German-BERT, on monolingual and machine-translated training data; and (2)
zero-shot prompting using two LLMs: o3-mini for Annotation (rule-based
labelling) and gpt-4.1-mini for DoubleDown (contrastive rewriting) and
Perspective (comparative reasoning). The Annotation Approach achieves 1st place
in the Italian monolingual subtask with an F_1 score of 0.8104, outperforming
the baseline of 0.6941. In the Romanian zero-shot setting, the fine-tuned
XLM-RoBERTa model obtains an F_1 score of 0.7917, ranking 3rd and exceeding the
baseline of 0.6461. The same model also performs reliably in the multilingual
task and improves over the baseline in Greek. For German, a German-BERT model
fine-tuned on translated training data from typologically related languages
yields competitive performance over the baseline. In contrast, performance in
the Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings falls slightly below the respective
baselines, reflecting the challenge of generalization in low-resource
cross-lingual scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs have shallow understanding of puns and can be easily misled by subtle changes, despite showing promise in pun detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the depth of LLM understanding of puns and demonstrate their vulnerability to nuanced changes in wordplay.

Method: Systematic analysis and reformulation of existing pun benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and robustness analysis.

Result: Subtle changes in puns are sufficient to mislead LLMs, revealing their shallow understanding compared to human interpretation.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant robustness challenges in processing puns and lack the nuanced grasp that humans possess for this form of wordplay.

Abstract: Puns are a form of humorous wordplay that exploits polysemy and phonetic
similarity. While LLMs have shown promise in detecting puns, we show in this
paper that their understanding often remains shallow, lacking the nuanced grasp
typical of human interpretation. By systematically analyzing and reformulating
existing pun benchmarks, we demonstrate how subtle changes in puns are
sufficient to mislead LLMs. Our contributions include comprehensive and nuanced
pun detection benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and an analysis
of the robustness challenges these models face in processing puns.

TL;DR: RAGs-to-Riches is a prompting framework that reformulates LLM role-playing as a text retrieval problem, using curated reference demonstrations to improve character consistency and reduce harmful improvisation when interacting with hostile users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed in high-stakes domains often break character in harmful ways during few-shot role-playing, especially with hostile users, which can impact user trust and well-being.

Method: Inspired by RAG, the approach reformulates role-playing as a text retrieval problem and uses curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses, with novel token-level ROUGE metrics (IOO and IOR) for evaluation.

Result: The method incorporates 35% more tokens from reference demonstrations during hostile interactions, and across 453 interactions, models were consistently judged as more authentic and in-character compared to zero-shot and ICL methods.

Conclusion: RAGs-to-Riches provides a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks that maintain character consistency in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where
failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective
paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches
often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful
ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a
text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called
RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition
LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting
and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output
(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References
(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation
tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy
incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens
from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing
interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and
remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)
methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,
human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether speech-aware large language models maintain their language understanding capabilities when accessed through speech input rather than text, and to quantify fairness across different speaker demographics.

Method: Uses textual tasks combined with a voice cloning text-to-speech model to convert text inputs to speech, then measures model performance to quantify capability preservation across modalities.

Result: The benchmark provides quantitative assessment of cross-modal capability conservation, fairness across speaker categories, and robustness between text and speech modalities.

Conclusion: C3T serves as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating speech-aware LLMs' ability to maintain language understanding when switching from text to speech input, addressing both performance preservation and fairness concerns.

Abstract: The paper presents C3T (Cross-modal Capabilities Conservation Test), a new
benchmark for assessing the performance of speech-aware large language models.
The benchmark utilizes textual tasks and a voice cloning text-to-speech model
to quantify the extent to which language understanding capabilities are
preserved when the model is accessed via speech input. C3T quantifies the
fairness of the model for different categories of speakers and its robustness
across text and speech modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable privacy control in shared-space mixed reality meetings by allowing primary users to selectively remove personal/sensitive items from other participants' view.

Method: Uses semantic segmentation with YOLOv11 for object detection and modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for real-time video inpainting from secondary viewpoint via mobile ZED 2i depth camera.

Result: System achieves real-time performance at 720p resolution with frame rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating portable and robust operation without fixed secondary viewpoint or prior 3D scanning.

Conclusion: Feasible real-time diminished reality solution for practical privacy-preserving MR applications, providing selective object removal while maintaining high-quality video output.

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

*Alejandra Perez,Chinedu Nwoye,Ramtin Raji Kermani,Omid Mohareri,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgLaVi is the largest surgical vision-language dataset with 240k clip-caption pairs from 200+ procedures, featuring hierarchical annotations and automated quality filtering. It enables SurgCLIP model to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple surgical recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in surgical vision-language pre-training is limited by small, low-quality datasets lacking procedural diversity and hierarchical structure. Existing datasets constrain the development of effective surgical foundation models.

Method: Created SurgLaVi dataset using automated pipeline that generates fine-grained transcriptions, segments videos into procedural units, and applies dual-modality filtering to remove noisy samples. Introduced SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders.

Result: SurgCLIP achieved consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition tasks, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The open-source SurgLaVi-beta contains 113k pairs (4x larger than existing datasets).

Conclusion: Large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

*Emily Kaczmarek,Justin Szeto,Brennan Nichyporuk,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-resolution SimCLR-based self-supervised learning foundation model for 3D brain MRI that outperforms other methods across multiple neurological disease prediction tasks, even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for 3D MRI brain analysis are task-specific with limited generalization. While SSL has shown success in 2D medical imaging, few accessible foundation models exist for 3D brain MRI that can handle diverse neurological conditions.

Method: Developed a general SimCLR-based SSL foundation model pre-trained on 18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 public datasets spanning diverse neurological diseases. Compared against Masked Autoencoders and supervised baselines on four downstream prediction tasks.

Result: The fine-tuned SimCLR model outperformed all other models across all tasks. Notably achieved superior performance using only 20% of labeled training samples for Alzheimer's disease prediction. Performed well in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: The model provides a broadly applicable and accessible foundation for clinical brain MRI analysis, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse neurological conditions and data efficiency with limited labeled samples.

Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

*Xiaoyang Ma,Yiyang Chai,Xinran Qu,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USCTNet reconstructs hyperspectral images from RGB using physics-grounded optimization with learnable CSS/illumination estimation and efficient low-rank subspace SVD for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-to-HSI reconstruction is ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when camera spectral sensitivity and scene illumination are misspecified, requiring a physics-aware approach.

Method: Formulate as physics-grounded inverse problem with nuclear norm regularization in learnable transform domain. Introduce data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT to avoid full SVD costs. Develop USCTNet deep unfolding solver with parameter estimation module and learnable proximal updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-grounded approach with explicit CSS/illumination estimation and efficient low-rank subspace optimization enables more accurate and physically consistent hyperspectral image reconstruction from single RGB images.

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

*Felicia Liu,Jay J. Yoo,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs underperform CNNs in medical imaging tasks (glioma classification and segmentation), showing limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks compared to traditional CNNs, as LLMs have shown strong performance in text-based healthcare but remain unexplored in image-based applications.

Method: Evaluated general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) before and after fine-tuning on BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, compared against custom 3D CNNs for glioma classification and segmentation using three methods (center point, bounding box, polygon extraction).

Result: CNNs achieved 80% accuracy in classification with balanced precision/recall, while LLMs reached 76% accuracy but suffered from poor specificity (18%). Fine-tuning improved LLM specificity to 55% but reduced overall accuracy to 72%. For segmentation, CNNs accurately localized tumors while LLMs clustered predictions near image center without distinguishing tumor characteristics.

Conclusion: CNNs significantly outperform LLMs in both tasks. LLMs show limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating they are not currently well-suited for image-based medical tasks without more rigorous training strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based
healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains
unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,
specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their
performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using
the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

*Hao Zhang,Chun-Han Yao,Simon Donné,Narendra Ahuja,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP4D is a dual-branch diffusion framework that generates paired RGB videos and kinematic part segmentation maps from monocular inputs, enabling 3D skeletal structure extraction with minimal manual adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional part segmentation methods rely on appearance-based semantic cues rather than structural components aligned with object articulation. There's a need for kinematic parts that are consistent across views and time for animation and motion-related tasks.

Method: Uses a dual-branch diffusion model with spatial color encoding to map part masks to RGB-like images, sharing the latent VAE with RGB branch. Includes Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion module and contrastive part consistency loss for cross-branch consistency. Trained on KinematicParts20K dataset of 20K rigged objects.

Result: SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse scenarios including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare articulated poses. Generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D to derive skeletal structures and skinning weights with few manual adjustments.

Conclusion: The framework produces kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion tasks, demonstrating strong generalization across various scenarios while maintaining view and temporal consistency.

Abstract: We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

*Sven Schreiber,Noha Sarhan,Simone Frintrop,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegSLR combines RGB and pose data using promptable zero-shot video segmentation to preserve hand shape details in sign language recognition, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on ChaLearn249 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISLR approaches lose crucial hand shape and orientation details when combining RGB and pose modalities due to imprecise representations like bounding boxes.

Method: Uses pose information for rough localization of hands and body, then segments these parts through zero-shot video segmentation to maintain shape details, focusing RGB processing on relevant body parts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset, with ablation studies showing strong benefits from focusing on signer's body and hands.

Conclusion: SegSLR effectively combines RGB and pose information through segmentation, preserving crucial details and improving ISLR performance, validating the design approach.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE framework integrates speech commands with vision foundation models for real-time surgical scene segmentation and tracking without manual cues or labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical segmentation methods require domain-specific labeled data and manual cues, limiting adaptability in dynamic operating room environments.

Method: Speech-guided collaborative perception framework combining LLM reasoning with open-set VFMs, using clinician speech feedback to guide segmentation and instrument tracking.

Result: Evaluated on Cataract1k and in-house skull-base datasets, demonstrating real-time segmentation and tracking capabilities in live mock experiments.

Conclusion: The human-AI collaboration paradigm enables adaptable, hands-free surgical tools for dynamic operating room environments.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-GRT is a two-stage pipeline combining 4D Gaussian Splatting with ray tracing to generate videos with realistic camera effects like fisheye distortion and rolling shutter, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision systems fail with real-world camera effects due to lack of training data. Existing data generation methods are costly, have sim-to-real gaps, or fail to accurately model camera effects.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Reconstruct dynamic scenes from multi-view videos using 4D Gaussian Splatting, 2) Apply physically-based ray tracing to generate videos with controllable camera effects.

Result: Achieves fastest rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality compared to baselines. Created benchmark with eight synthetic dynamic scenes across four camera effects.

Conclusion: 4D-GRT provides an effective solution for generating realistic camera effect data, addressing the bottleneck in training computer vision systems for real-world camera distortions.

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

TL;DR: A multi-agent system for automated video editing using an Editor agent that processes video clips with natural language instructions and a Critic agent that provides feedback, outperforming existing methods in human preference and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate the core video editing task as current tools focus mainly on retrieval and UI, leaving actual editing to users, which limits efficiency and accessibility.

Method: Multi-agent approach with Editor agent using video editing tools to process clips based on natural language instructions, and Critic agent providing feedback or final rendering. Uses learning-based communication between specialized agents.

Result: System vastly outperforms existing approaches in coverage, time constraint satisfaction, and human preference based on user study evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework successfully automates video editing through effective agent communication and LLM-based evaluation, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from
filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous
video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

TL;DR: A stability-aware ML framework predicts glioma MRI contrast enhancement from non-contrast scans, achieving high accuracy (avg 0.93) across multicenter datasets while reducing gadolinium contrast agent dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) pose safety, cost, and accessibility concerns in glioma imaging. ML prediction of enhancement from non-contrast MRI offers a safer alternative for assessing tumor aggressiveness and treatment planning.

Method: Analyzed 1,446 glioma cases from 4 TCIA datasets. Extracted 108 radiomic features from non-contrast T1WI, combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25 classifiers (1,200 pipelines total). Used rotational validation trained on 3 datasets, tested on the fourth.

Result: Cross-validation accuracy: 0.91-0.96; external testing: avg 0.93 (range 0.87-0.98). F1, precision, recall stable (0.87-0.96), ROC-AUC varied (0.50-0.82) due to cohort heterogeneity. MI+ETr pipeline consistently performed best.

Conclusion: Stability-aware model selection enables reliable prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI, reducing GBCA reliance and improving multicenter generalizability. Provides scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

TL;DR: A detector-agnostic post-processing framework that improves recall for dense small objects in UAV imagery by converting overlap-induced redundancy into group evidence through spatial and semantic clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter, requiring improved recall for applications like far-field counting and monitoring.

Method: Overlapping tiling recovers low-confidence candidates, then Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids) and Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) validate group evidence. Validated groups receive confidence reweighting before class-aware NMS fusion.

Result: On VisDrone dataset: recall increased from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093), precision adjusted from 0.801 to 0.595, yielding F1=0.669. Post-processing latency averages 0.095s per image.

Conclusion: The framework provides recall-first, precision-trade-off behavior beneficial for recall-sensitive applications, requires no retraining, and integrates with modern detectors. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and add temporal cues.

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with
modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and
extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for Embodied AI suffer from limited scale/diversity, sanitized layouts without small items, and object collisions, hindering realistic simulation and model training.

Method: Created by integrating three scene sources (real-world scans, procedural generation, designer-created scenes) with comprehensive processing including real-to-sim replica creation, interactive object incorporation, and physical simulation for collision resolution.

Result: Dataset contains 40K scenes, 1.96M 3D objects, 15 scene types, 288 object classes, with realistic layouts averaging 41.5 objects per region. Demonstrated value through scene layout generation and point-goal navigation benchmarks.

Conclusion: InternScenes enables scaling up model training for complex scene tasks, provides new challenges for Embodied AI, and will be open-sourced to benefit the research community.

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,
sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and
covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve
massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the

*Robert M. Corless,Deepak Singh Kalhan,Stephen M. Watt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of polynomial basis choices (Legendre, Chebyshev, Sobolev variants) for mathematical handwriting representation, focusing on computational efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs through condition numbers and norm bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize mathematical handwriting representation by finding the best balance between computational cost and modeling accuracy through appropriate basis selection and polynomial degree.

Method: Analyzed condition numbers for polynomial evaluation in various bases (Legendre, Chebyshev, and their Sobolev variants) and bounded how different inner products provide norms for symbol variations.

Result: The study provides insights into trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree, showing how different bases affect computational efficiency and accuracy in mathematical handwriting modeling.

Conclusion: Careful selection of polynomial basis and degree can achieve accurate mathematical handwriting modeling with low computational cost, with condition numbers and norm bounds serving as key metrics for optimization.

Abstract: Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial
representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented
in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact
geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also
been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the
trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate
modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition
number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner
products give norms for the variations between symbols.

*Aghiles Kebaili,Romain Modzelewski,Jérôme Lapuyade-Lahorgue,Maxime Fontanilles,Sébastien Thureau,Su Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic prediction of glioma progression using longitudinal MRI data, integrating deformation modeling and targeted data augmentation to handle sparse clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioma's rapid progression and poor prognosis require accurate prediction, but clinical MRI data is often sparse and irregularly acquired, creating data imbalances that make reliable modeling difficult.

Method: Multitask diffusion framework that simultaneously generates future FLAIR sequences and estimates spatial probabilistic tumor evolution maps using signed distance fields. Includes pretrained deformation module for temporal dynamics, targeted augmentation pipeline for data scarcity, and radiotherapy-weighted focal loss leveraging radiation dose maps.

Result: The framework produces flexible time-dependent probability maps from just two follow-up scans, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at any future milestone. Achieved promising results on both public and private datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses clinical data limitations in glioma progression prediction, providing time-agnostic, pixel-wise predictions with uncertainty quantification that can assist clinicians in treatment planning and risk assessment.

Abstract: Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

*Simone Mosco,Daniel Fusaro,Wanmeng Li,Emanuele Menegatti,Alberto Pretto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LiDAR point cloud segmentation method using point-plane projections to extract 2D features from 3D data, with geometry-aware augmentation for improved performance in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR segmentation methods suffer from high computational complexity, require large training datasets, and have limited generalization in data-scarce scenarios. The paper aims to improve point-based methods without relying on external sensors or datasets.

Method: Uses point-plane projections to extract complementary 2D features from 3D LiDAR data. Introduces geometry-aware data augmentation technique aligned with LiDAR sensor properties to address class imbalance. Projects onto multiple informative 2D representations.

Result: Significant improvements in limited-data scenarios. Achieves competitive results on standard datasets SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. Method works solely with LiDAR data without requiring cameras or external datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances LiDAR point cloud segmentation by leveraging 2D representations through point-plane projections and geometry-aware augmentation, demonstrating strong performance especially in data-scarce conditions.

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

### [103] [OpenUrban3D: Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Urban Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10842)
*Chongyu Wang,Kunlei Jing,Jihua Zhu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenUrban3D is the first 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that works without aligned multi-view images or pre-trained networks, achieving superior segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is crucial for urban point clouds in applications like digital twins and smart cities, but remains unexplored due to challenges like missing multi-view imagery and poor generalization of existing 3D segmentation methods across diverse urban environments.

Method: Generates semantic features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model.

Result: Extensive experiments on SensatUrban and SUM benchmarks show significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization over existing methods.

Conclusion: OpenUrban3D demonstrates potential as a flexible and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding, enabling zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing semantic richness and geometric priors.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

*Aryan Kashyap Naveen,Bhuvanesh Singla,Raajan Wankhade,Shreesha M,Ramu S,Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoOEP is a multi-modal automated exam proctoring system that uses dual cameras, computer vision, and LSTM networks to detect cheating behaviors with 90.7% accuracy and real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of online education requires scalable academic integrity solutions, as traditional human proctoring is not feasible at scale and existing automated systems are either intrusive or ineffective at detecting various cheating behaviors.

Method: Uses dual-camera setup (frontal and side views) with computer vision modules: Face Module for identity verification (ArcFace), head pose, gaze tracking, and mouth movement analysis; Hand Module with fine-tuned YOLOv11 for prohibited item detection; features aggregated into LSTM network for temporal pattern analysis and real-time cheating probability scoring.

Result: Achieves 90.7% accuracy in suspicious activity classification, mAP@.5 of 0.57 for prohibited item detection, processes video at 2.4 FPS without GPU, demonstrating effective and resource-efficient automated proctoring.

Conclusion: AutoOEP provides an effective, scalable solution that significantly reduces human intervention needs and enhances online exam integrity through comprehensive multi-modal analysis and real-time cheating detection.

Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

*Weiqiang Zhao,Tianzhu Liu,Yuzhe Gui,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-camera CASSI framework with TV subgradient theory that improves spectral image reconstruction by integrating spatial priors from auxiliary cameras and providing mathematically interpretable optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in compressive spectral imaging where high compression ratios create ill-posed reconstruction problems, and overcome the constraints of both traditional model-based methods (limited performance) and deep learning approaches (lack of interpretability).

Method: Proposes a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework integrating total variation subgradient theory. Uses an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical model with dynamic regularization strategy incorporating normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic reference images. Includes adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras.

Result: Experimental results show effective preservation of spatial-spectral structural consistency. The method demonstrates robust performance across diverse reconstruction scenarios and establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for computational spectral imaging.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the trade-off between spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions in compressive spectral imaging, providing both improved reconstruction performance and mathematical interpretability through TV subgradient theory and multi-camera spatial priors.

Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

*Mohanad Albughdadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact 2.5M-parameter metadata-aware mixture-of-experts masked autoencoder (MoE-MAE) achieves competitive performance with much larger models in Earth Observation tasks by incorporating geo-temporal conditioning alongside imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Earth Observation foundation models are computationally expensive and inaccessible for downstream tasks, creating a need for more efficient and compact alternatives.

Method: Proposed Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder (MoE-MAE) with sparse expert routing and geo-temporal conditioning (latitude/longitude, seasonal/daily cyclic encodings). Pretrained on BigEarthNet-Landsat and evaluated using linear probes on frozen encoder embeddings.

Result: Despite only 2.5M parameters, the model competes with much larger architectures. Metadata-aware pretraining improves transfer and label efficiency. Maintains competitive performance on EuroSAT-Landsat dataset even without explicit metadata.

Conclusion: Compact, metadata-aware MoE-MAEs represent an efficient and scalable pathway toward future Earth Observation foundation models, demonstrating that small models can achieve performance comparable to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

### [107] [Simulating Sinogram-Domain Motion and Correcting Image-Domain Artifacts Using Deep Learning in HR-pQCT Bone Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10961)
*Farhan Sadik,Christopher L. Newman,Stuart J. Warden,Rachel K. Surowiec*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed ESWGAN-GP model with edge-enhancing skip connections and self-attention mechanisms to correct motion artifacts in HR-pQCT bone imaging, achieving improved SNR, SSIM, and VIF metrics on both simulated and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid-motion artifacts hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in HR-pQCT, and no motion correction methods exist due to lack of standardized degradation models.

Method: Optimized sinogram-based method to simulate motion artifacts, created paired datasets, and developed ESWGAN-GP with edge-enhancing skip connections, self-attention mechanisms, and VGG-based perceptual loss.

Result: Achieved SNR 26.78, SSIM 0.81, VIF 0.76 on source dataset; SNR 29.31, SSIM 0.87, VIF 0.81 on target dataset with improved performance.

Conclusion: The methods represent an important initial step toward implementing deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT, though they address a simplified representation of real-world motion complexity.

Abstract: Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

TL;DR: Analysis of factors affecting gaze-based authentication performance using large-scale VR dataset, finding calibration depth consistency, gaze fusion, and signal quality improve performance while simple filtering slightly reduces it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the key factors that influence the performance of state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication systems, particularly in VR environments.

Method: Conducted experiments on a large-scale dataset of 8,849 subjects using Meta Quest Pro equivalent hardware with 72Hz video oculography. Employed state-of-the-art neural network architecture to study eye tracking signal quality, calibration aspects, and gaze filtering effects.

Result: Using same calibration target depth, fusing calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality all enhance authentication performance. A simple three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces performance in general, with some exceptions noted.

Conclusion: Careful consideration of calibration parameters and signal quality is crucial for optimal gaze-based authentication performance, while simple filtering approaches may have negative impacts on authentication accuracy.

Abstract: This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of
state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a
large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta
Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze
estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture
was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication
performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking
calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using
the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing
calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality
all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple
three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance
in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions
were noted.

*Haoming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueSkin dataset with 7,299 images addresses skin tone recognition and generation challenges, revealing biases in existing models and showing significant improvements when used for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin tone recognition and generation are crucial for model fairness, healthcare, and generative AI, but existing methods struggle due to lack of comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies.

Method: Created TrueSkin dataset with 7,299 images systematically categorized into 6 classes under diverse conditions. Benchmarked existing recognition and generation approaches, then trained and fine-tuned models using TrueSkin.

Result: LMMs misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, generative models struggle with prompt biases. Training on TrueSkin improved classification accuracy by >20% and significantly enhanced skin tone fidelity in generation models.

Conclusion: TrueSkin serves as both a benchmark for evaluation and valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone recognition and generation tasks.

Abstract: Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled training data for animal detection in wildlife conservation and livestock management, combined with the challenge of selecting optimal pre-trained models from numerous neural network architectures.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework with upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to systematically evaluate and rank pre-trained models for animal detection tasks.

Result: Achieves higher detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared to traditional transfer learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based framework provides an efficient automated solution for model selection in transfer learning applications for animal detection from UAV imagery.

Abstract: Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

TL;DR: A prototypical network approach for few-shot fungal species recognition that outperforms the competition baseline by over 30% in Recall@5, effectively handling imbalanced data and rare species identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate automatic fungal species recognition tools that can handle highly imbalanced class distributions and reliably identify rare species with very few training samples, supporting biodiversity monitoring efforts.

Method: Proposed a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks that enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification.

Result: The prototypical network approach exceeded the competition baseline by more than 30 percentage points in Recall@5 on both public and private leaderboards.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying both common and rare fungal species, effectively supporting the objectives of FungiCLEF 2025 for biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of
FungiCLEF 2025.

*Yuedi Zhang,Zhixiang Xia,Guosheng Yin,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: csMIL is a novel Multi-Instance Learning framework that uses global-local clustering and cluster-level sparsity to selectively retain relevant instances while discarding noisy ones, achieving SOTA performance on histopathology benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIL approaches struggle with instance redundancy and lack mechanisms to discard non-informative instances, limiting robustness and interpretability in applications like computational pathology.

Method: csMIL performs global clustering across all bags to establish cluster centers, local clustering within each bag, computes attention scores within clusters, and applies sparse regularization to cluster weights for selective retention of relevant clusters.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows csMIL requires O(s log K) bags to recover s relevant clusters. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC histopathology benchmarks.

Conclusion: csMIL enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, reduces computational complexity, and provides a principled approach for sparse MIL in weakly labeled datasets.

Abstract: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to
recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.
Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public
histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

### [113] [Action Hints: Semantic Typicality and Context Uniqueness for Generalizable Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11058)
*Canhui Tang,Sanping Zhou,Haoyue Shi,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot skeleton-based video anomaly detection framework that uses language-guided semantic typicality modeling and test-time context uniqueness analysis to achieve state-of-the-art performance without target domain training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing skeleton-based methods only learn low-level representations and rely on domain-limited normality boundaries, which fail to generalize to new scenes with different normal/abnormal behavior patterns. Skeleton data has inherent generalizable advantages but needs better utilization.

Method: Two main modules: 1) Language-guided semantic typicality modeling that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM knowledge of typical behaviors; 2) Test-time context uniqueness analysis that finely analyzes spatio-temporal differences to derive scene-adaptive boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets (ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, UCF-Crime) featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes, without using any target domain training samples.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unlocks skeleton data potential through action typicality and uniqueness learning, demonstrating strong generalization capability for zero-shot video anomaly detection across diverse unseen surveillance scenes.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable,
cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present
a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic

*Zongwu Xie,Kaijie Yun,Yang Liu,Yiming Ji,Han Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Robust multi-modal framework for planetary rover traversability prediction using camera and LiDAR fusion with self-supervised IMU-derived labels, showing strong geometric dominance and high robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable traversability costmap prediction system for planetary rovers that can handle challenging terrain conditions without requiring manual labeling, using self-supervised learning from sensor data.

Method: Fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce bird's-eye-view terrain costmaps using DINOv3-based image encoder, FiLM-based sensor fusion, and optimization loss combining Huber and smoothness terms. Trained self-supervised with IMU-derived labels.

Result: Model shows high robustness with only minor performance changes in MAE/MSE during experimental ablations (e.g., MAE increases from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating geometry dominates learned cost.

Conclusion: The framework provides a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction solution with contributions including high-fidelity simulation environment, self-supervised labeling pipeline, and robust model architecture. Future work focuses on domain generalization and dataset expansion.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset
expansion.

*Chao Chen,Shunyu Yao,Yuanwu He,Tao Feng,Ruojing Song,Yuliang Guo,Xinyu Huang,Chenxu Wu,Ren Liu,Chen Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAA-Policy is an end-to-end imitation learning system that uses control signals to guide visual attention learning, improving parking policy robustness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end approaches lack effective synergy between perception and control, with transformer-based self-attention producing unstable spatial attention that undermines policy reliability.

Method: Proposes Control-Aided Attention (CAA) mechanism trained self-supervised using backpropagated gradients from control outputs, integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction, and adds a motion prediction module for target tracking.

Result: Extensive CARLA simulator experiments show CAA-Policy consistently surpasses end-to-end baseline and modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Using control signals to guide attention learning rather than minimizing training loss leads to more robust and generalizable policies for precise parking tasks.

Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

*Zeyu Dong,Yuyang Yin,Yuqi Li,Eric Li,Hao-Xiang Guo,Yikai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently generate high-quality 360° panoramic videos by fine-tuning pretrained video diffusion models, requiring only ~1,000 videos and outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video generation models struggle with panoramic content due to fundamental differences from perspective-view projections. Existing solutions are complex, inefficient, and produce suboptimal results.

Method: Treat panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views using LoRA. Theoretically analyze that LoRA can model the transformation between projections when rank exceeds task degrees of freedom. Efficiently fine-tune pretrained video diffusion models with only ~1,000 videos.

Result: Achieves high-quality panoramic generation while maintaining proper projection geometry. Surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Conclusion: LoRA-based adaptation provides an efficient and effective solution for panoramic video generation, demonstrating superior performance with minimal training data requirements compared to complex architectures and large-scale training approaches.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

*Ruiying Li,Bin Pan,Qiaoying Qu,Xia Xu,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMILE proposes a super-resolution guided multi-task learning method for hyperspectral unmixing with theoretical guarantees on task affinity and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral unmixing performance is limited by low spatial resolution. Direct integration of super-resolution and unmixing faces challenges with unverified task affinity and lack of convergence guarantees.

Method: Proposes SMILE framework with theoretical analysis including relationship, existence, and accessibility theorems. Learns both shared and specific representations to generalize positive information from super-resolution to unmixing.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets substantiate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: SMILE provides progressive theoretical support and a new framework that successfully enhances hyperspectral unmixing through super-resolution guidance with guaranteed convergence.

Abstract: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have
substantiate the usefulness of our work.

TL;DR: Proposes Cog-TD, a copula-guided temporal dependency method for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing that explicitly models temporal dependencies using copula theory to capture dynamical material evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency and fail to capture dynamical material evolution in multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing. Copula theory's ability to explicitly model dependency structures provides a promising approach.

Method: Defines new mathematical model incorporating copula theory, constructs copula-guided framework with two key modules: copula function estimation and temporal dependency guidance to compute and employ temporal information in unmixing process.

Result: Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed Cog-TD method for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing.

Conclusion: The paper successfully redefines MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposes a copula-guided framework with theoretical support, and demonstrates effectiveness through experiments, providing a novel approach for capturing dynamical material evolution.

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers
and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DAeroRelief is the first 3D benchmark dataset for post-disaster assessment, collected via UAVs over hurricane-damaged areas, featuring dense 3D point clouds with semantic annotations of structural damage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D benchmarks focus on urban/indoor scenes and lack disaster contexts, while 2D imagery suffers from depth limitations and occlusions for damage assessment.

Method: Used low-cost UAVs to collect data over hurricane-damaged regions, reconstructed dense 3D point clouds via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo, with semantic annotations created through manual 2D labeling projected into 3D space.

Result: Created the first large-scale 3D outdoor dataset capturing fine-grained structural damage in real disaster contexts, enabling evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models.

Conclusion: 3DAeroRelief serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D vision systems in post-disaster scenarios, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for 3D scene understanding in disaster response.

Abstract: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

*Nhi Kieu,Kien Nguyen,Arnold Wiliem,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEMMNet is a novel generative-enhanced multimodal network that addresses missing modality issues in remote sensing semantic segmentation by combining hybrid feature extraction, multiscale fusion, and complementary loss to outperform existing generative and non-generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal signals in real-world scenarios are prone to missing due to sensor failures and adverse weather, which severely degrades model performance. Existing generative approaches inadequately handle the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data and suffer from heavy dependence on dominant modalities.

Method: Proposes GEMMNet with three key components: 1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) for modality-specific representations, 2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) for capturing modality-synergistic context across scales, and 3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) to reduce bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks.

Result: GEMMNet outperforms both generative baselines (AE, cGAN) and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches (mmformer, shaspec) on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam).

Conclusion: The proposed GEMMNet effectively addresses the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling multimodal remote sensing data heterogeneity and demonstrates superior performance in semantic segmentation under missing modality conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fluid reconstruction methods rely on controlled lab environments, leaving real-world videos largely unexplored despite recent advances in 3D vision and fluid dynamics rendering.

Method: Targeted techniques including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos to address three key challenges of real-world smoke reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with +2.22 average PSNR improvement on wild videos, and enables diverse realistic editing of fluid dynamics through simulation.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between controlled lab environments and real-world video capture for smoke reconstruction, providing high-quality 4D smoke assets for interactive design and editing applications.

Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from
a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for
smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but
also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our

*Ashkan Taghipour,Vahid Naghshin,Benjamin Southwell,Farid Boussaid,Hamid Laga,Mohammed Bennamoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVR-GS introduces spatially variant regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing Gaussian count by 1.79x vs MaskGS and 5.63x vs 3DGS with minimal PSNR drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based pruning methods use global mean regularization that doesn't align with per-pixel reconstruction loss, leading to suboptimal sparsity.

Method: Proposes SVR-GS with per-pixel spatial masks from Gaussian contributions along rays, implementing three aggregation strategies in CUDA with gradient analysis.

Result: Achieves 1.79x reduction in Gaussians vs MaskGS and 5.63x vs 3DGS with only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR drops respectively across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SVR-GS produces significantly smaller, faster, and more memory-efficient models suitable for real-time applications like robotics and AR/VR.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

TL;DR: Novel learning framework predicts 3D coral volume and surface area from 2D multi-view RGB images using VGGT feature extraction and DGCNN decoders with confidence estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective reef monitoring requires accurate coral volumetric and surface area quantification, which is challenging due to corals' complex morphology.

Method: Uses pre-trained VGGT to extract dense point maps from multi-view images, merges into unified point cloud with confidence scores, then processes through parallel DGCNN decoder heads with composite Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss for joint volume and surface area prediction.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well to unseen coral morphologies.

Conclusion: Framework enables efficient and scalable coral geometry estimation directly from sparse image sets, with applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Abstract: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Method: Built on Qwen2.5-VL backbone with LoRA fine-tuning on traffic-specific datasets, plus innovative knowledge prompting module combining Chain-of-Thought reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for precise traffic knowledge injection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks, with superior ability to process multimodal traffic data and remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Traffic-MLLM effectively addresses spatiotemporal causality modeling and domain knowledge integration challenges in traffic video analysis, demonstrating strong performance and generalization across complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding
plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal
analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately
modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge,
limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model
tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone,
our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing
its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences.
Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge
into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical

*Hong Zhang,Fei Guo,Zihan Xie,Dizhao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multispectral-NeRF extends NeRF to handle 6-band spectral data instead of just RGB, improving multispectral 3D reconstruction accuracy and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction relies on RGB data, while modern sensors capture additional spectral bands. Existing multispectral methods suffer from high costs, low accuracy, and poor geometry. NeRF-based approaches can solve these issues but currently only work with 3-band data.

Method: Enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF with three modifications: expanded hidden layers for 6-band inputs, redesigned residual functions for spectral discrepancy optimization, and adapted data compression modules for higher bit-depth multispectral imagery.

Result: Experimental results show Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while accurately preserving original scenes' spectral characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed Multispectral-NeRF effectively addresses the limitations of current multispectral 3D reconstruction methods by extending NeRF to handle multi-band spectral data, producing high-precision reconstruction results.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of
real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D
images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

*Zhiwen Yang,Yuxin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPHERE integrates voxel and Gaussian representations for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, combining semantic guidance with physical-aware modeling to achieve realistic geometric details and semantic accuracy in autonomous driving scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC methods struggle to capture physical regularities for realistic geometric details, while neural reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS suffer from high computational costs and slow convergence in large-scale autonomous driving scenes, leading to poor semantic accuracy.

Method: SPHERE uses Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) to leverage dual-branch 3D scene representations for locating focal voxels as anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization, and Physical-aware Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) that incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry consistency through focal distribution alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SPHERE, demonstrating improved performance in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Conclusion: SPHERE successfully integrates voxel and Gaussian representations to achieve joint exploitation of semantic and physical information, generating SSC results with realistic details while addressing the limitations of existing methods in computational efficiency and semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

*Chengde Lin,Xuezhu Gong,Shuxue Ding,Mingzhe Yang,Xijun Lu,Chengjun Mo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StegOT is an autoencoder-based image steganography model that uses optimal transport theory to address mode collapse issues in GAN/VAE-based methods, achieving better information balance between cover and secret images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN and VAE-based steganography models suffer from mode collapse, which causes information imbalance between cover and secret images in stego images and affects extraction quality.

Method: Proposes StegOT with a multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module that transforms multi-peak feature distributions into single-peak distributions to achieve information trade-off between cover and secret images.

Result: Experiments show the model achieves better trade-off between cover and secret images while enhancing quality of both stego and recovery images.

Conclusion: StegOT effectively addresses mode collapse in steganography through optimal transport theory, improving information balance and image quality in both hiding and extraction processes.

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

### [130] [The Impact of Skin Tone Label Granularity on the Performance and Fairness of AI Based Dermatology Image Classification Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11184)
*Partha Shah,Durva Sankhe,Maariyah Rashid,Zakaa Khaled,Esther Puyol-Antón,Tiarna Lee,Maram Alqarni,Sweta Rai,Andrew P. King*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study shows FST scale granularity affects AI skin lesion classification performance and bias - coarser groupings reduce performance, suggesting need for alternative skin tone scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI skin lesion classifiers show bias based on skin tone, and the commonly used Fitzpatrick Skin Tone scale has criticized granularity issues with better representation for lighter skin tones.

Method: Trained multiple AI models to classify benign vs malignant lesions using FST-specific data with different granularity levels (three groups: FST 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 vs coarser groupings).

Result: Models trained on FST-specific three-group data performed better than general FST-balanced models. Reducing granularity (combining FST 1/2/3/4) had detrimental effects on performance.

Conclusion: FST scale granularity significantly impacts model performance, providing evidence to move away from FST scale in fair AI research toward alternative scales that better represent skin tone diversity.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions
from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also
susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin
tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has
been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for
lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact
(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST
scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions
using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when
training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

*Yihang She,Andrew Blake,David Coomes,Srinivasan Keshav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic forest data generation pipeline using game engines and LiDAR simulation reduces need for real labeled data in tree segmentation, achieving competitive results with minimal real data fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D forest datasets are too small for robust tree segmentation systems, and real data collection is expensive. Synthetic data has shown success in other domains like self-driving.

Method: Developed synthetic data generation pipeline integrating game-engines with physics-based LiDAR simulation to create large-scale annotated 3D forest dataset. Used synthetic data for pretraining and minimal real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.

Result: After fine-tuning on just 0.1 hectare of real forest data, the pretrained model achieves segmentation performance competitive with models trained on full-scale real datasets. Identified physics, diversity, and scale as critical success factors.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labeled real data in tree segmentation tasks, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems. The pipeline and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept sliders struggle with no-AIGC images, particularly real-world captured images, creating a need for better methods that can handle diverse image categories while maintaining realism.

Method: Integrates GANs and diffusion models with fine-grained textual and visual guidance in an adversarial manner to refine images and improve manipulation capabilities.

Result: Extensive experimental validation shows marked enhancement in image quality and realism, confirming the framework's robustness and versatility across various applications.

Abstract: In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has
never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made
strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images
captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond
Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to
facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories.
Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine
grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a
marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental
validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a
spectrum of applications.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic component-wise Spatial Transformer Network for fine-grained visual classification that decomposes affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing components with Gaussian variational posteriors to improve robustness against geometric variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification is highly sensitive to geometric variability (orientations, scales, perspective distortions). Existing equivariant architectures require substantial computational resources and restrict hypothesis space. Spatial Transformer Networks offer flexibility but need improvements for robustness.

Method: Decompose affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing components. Regress each component under geometric constraints using shared localization encoder. Model components with Gaussian variational posteriors and perform sampling-based canonicalization. Use novel component-wise alignment loss with augmentation parameters.

Result: Experiments on challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvement in robustness compared to other STN methods.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic component-wise STN approach effectively handles geometric variability in FGVC tasks while maintaining flexibility and backbone-agnostic nature, outperforming existing STN methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel few-shot learning framework using CCoMAML with MHAFF for cattle identification from muzzle patterns, achieving 98.46% F1 score without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID ear tags for cattle identification are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and security vulnerabilities. Biometric identification using cattle muzzle patterns offers a more robust alternative but faces challenges with limited data and dynamic herd compositions.

Method: Developed a Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) framework with Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as feature extractor for few-shot learning, enabling efficient adaptation to new data without retraining.

Result: Achieved superior performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores, outperforming current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques in cattle identification.

Conclusion: The proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF framework provides an effective solution for real-time cattle identification that adapts to new data with minimal samples, addressing limitations of traditional RFID and deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANROT-HELANet is a robust few-shot learning network that uses Hellinger distance-based aggregation and a novel contrastive loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance against adversarial attacks and natural noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian-based FSL methods using KL divergence are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises, requiring a more robust approach.

Method: Implements Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation, attention mechanisms, and a novel Hellinger Similarity contrastive loss function for variational few-shot inference.

Result: Achieves resilience to adversarial perturbations (ε=0.30) and Gaussian noise (σ=0.30), gains of 1.20% (1-shot) and 1.40% (5-shot) on miniImageNet, and superior image reconstruction (FID 2.75 vs 3.43 VAE).

Conclusion: ANROT-HELANet establishes new state-of-the-art performance with robust defense against both adversarial and natural perturbations across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce
ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation
Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and
performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust
Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot
scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger
Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach
also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75,
outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive
experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that
ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation,
attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both
adversarial and natural perturbations. Our code repository will be available at

TL;DR: MIS-LSTM is a hybrid CNN-LSTM framework for sleep quality and stress prediction using multimodal lifelog data, achieving Macro-F1 0.647 with uncertainty-aware ensemble.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective framework for predicting sleep quality and stress from multimodal lifelog data by capturing both spatial patterns and long-term temporal dependencies.

Method: Combines CNN encoders with LSTM: continuous sensor data converted to multi-channel images, discrete events encoded with 1D-CNN, fused with attention module, aggregated by LSTM, and enhanced with uncertainty-aware ensemble (UALRE).

Result: Achieves Macro-F1 0.615 with base model and 0.647 with UALRE ensemble, outperforming LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Best performance with 4-hour blocks and multi-channel imaging.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-LSTM approach with modality-specific encoding and uncertainty-aware ensemble effectively handles multimodal lifelog data for sleep and stress prediction, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to
0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm
(i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the
benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of
modality-specific discrete encoding.

TL;DR: CMLReID is a CLIP-based framework that addresses both same-cloth and clothing-change person re-identification in continual learning settings through adaptive prompts and knowledge fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world surveillance systems need person re-identification models that handle clothing changes while maintaining continual learning capabilities, but existing methods treat these as separate problems rather than an integrated challenge.

Method: Uses a CLIP-based framework with two novel components: Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) for adaptive prompt generation and visual-text alignment, and Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection (AKFP) with dual-path learning and Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.

Result: Outperforms all state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization despite clothing variations and sequential learning challenges.

Conclusion: CMLReID successfully integrates same-cloth and clothing-change re-identification in a continual learning framework, providing an effective solution for real-world surveillance applications with clothing variations.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth
(SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we
will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path
learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.
Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and
generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of
sequential learning.

### [138] [Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264)
*Kerun Mi,Guoliang Kang,Guangyu Li,Lin Zhao,Tao Zhou,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation that uses CLIP to extract domain-invariant class-agnostic attributes represented as key-value pairs, enabling rehearsal-free cross-domain alignment while reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CI-UDA methods require storing rehearsal samples and perform asymmetric alignment, leading to increasing memory usage and knowledge forgetting. The paper aims to avoid catastrophic forgetting while mitigating domain shift without rehearsal.

Method: Extract class-agnostic attributes using CLIP, represent them as key-value pairs (visual prototype + textual prompt), maintain two domain-specific attribute dictionaries, and perform cross-domain alignment through visual attention consistency and prediction consistency.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three CI-UDA benchmarks and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting without requiring rehearsal samples.

Conclusion: The proposed attribute-based approach successfully addresses CI-UDA by mining and preserving domain-invariant knowledge, enabling effective domain adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting in a memory-efficient manner.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets lack a universally accepted standard framework, and robust evaluation is critical for driving innovations in data generation methods and optimizing synthetic resource utilization.

Method: Integrates generalized cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles. Involves training task-specific models on both synthetic and real datasets to form a cross-performance matrix, then constructs a Generalized Cross-Validation Matrix to quantify domain transferability with two key metrics for simulation quality and transfer quality.

Result: Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in assessing synthetic data fidelity. The solution provides scalable and quantifiable evaluation that overcomes traditional limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a principled approach to guide synthetic dataset optimization in AI research, providing generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic
dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

Motivation: Outdoor scenes present challenges with unbounded environments and varying lighting conditions. Existing methods using NeRF or 3DGS suffer from high computational overhead and low-frequency lighting representations that lead to inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Reconstructs scene geometry using 2D Gaussian Splatting with monocular normal priors, 2) Decomposes texture and lighting through a hybrid model using spherical Gaussian functions for directional sunlight and Spherical Harmonic coefficients for skylight.

Result: ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting outdoor scenes, demonstrating superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency through both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons.

Conclusion: The proposed ROSGS pipeline effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by combining efficient geometric reconstruction with a hybrid lighting model, making it suitable for high-quality relighting of complex outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

### [141] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Self-Injecting Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11287)
*Yifan Lu,Ziqi Zhang,Chunfeng Yuan,Jun Gao,Congxuan Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APASI is a novel method that autonomously mitigates hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by self-injecting realistic hallucination patterns without external human annotations or auxiliary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation methods require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increases costs and limits sustainable improvement.

Method: APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into generated responses, creating preference pairs based on three key observations of hallucinations. It uses iterative alignment training with curriculum learning to periodically update preference data with increasing challenge.

Result: Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show APASI effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models and achieves comparable or superior performance to methods with external dependencies.

Conclusion: APASI demonstrates effectiveness and generalization capability as a self-sufficient hallucination mitigation method that doesn't require external resources.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at

### [142] [Leveraging Geometric Priors for Unaligned Scene Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11292)
*Ziling Liu,Ziwei Chen,Mingqi Gao,Jinyu Yang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for unaligned scene change detection that leverages geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address viewpoint variations, enabling reliable change detection without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues for cross-image correspondence, which fails under large viewpoint changes and lacks explicit geometric reasoning. The limited supervision from small-scale datasets restricts learning generalizable multi-view knowledge.

Method: Proposes a training-free framework that integrates geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model with visual foundation model representations to handle viewpoint misalignment, including reliable overlap identification, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion detection.

Result: Extensive evaluation on PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets demonstrates superior and robust performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The integration of geometric priors with visual foundation models effectively addresses the core challenges of unaligned scene change detection, providing a reliable solution for detecting changes under significant viewpoint variations.

Abstract: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

*Matthias Wüest,Francis Engelmann,Ondrej Miksik,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnLoc is an efficient data-driven method for camera localization using floorplans that introduces probabilistic uncertainty modeling and leverages pre-trained depth models, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack uncertainty modeling in depth predictions and require custom depth networks trained for each specific environment, limiting generalization and robustness.

Method: Proposes a novel probabilistic model that treats depth predictions as explicit probability distributions and uses off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models instead of per-environment-trained networks.

Result: Achieves 2.7x higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and 16.7x higher on short sequences (15 frames) than state-of-the-art methods on the challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

Conclusion: UnLoc provides a more robust and generalizable solution for sequential camera localization by incorporating uncertainty estimation and leveraging pre-trained models, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera
localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term
persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key
limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in
depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each
environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates
uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability
distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,
we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,
enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over
existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$
times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$
times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the
challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

*Jian Song,Wei Mei,Yunfeng Xu,Qiang Fu,Renke Kou,Lina Bu,Yucheng Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIKNet is a novel learning-aided Kalman filter that uses semantic-independent encoding to improve motion estimation in multi-object tracking, outperforming traditional methods with better robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Kalman filters based on linear constant-velocity models perform poorly when parameters are mismatched or objects move non-stationarily, requiring a more robust motion estimation approach for multi-object tracking.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet) with a Semantic-Independent Encoder that uses 1D convolution for homogeneous-semantic element encoding and fully-connected layers with nonlinear activation for heterogeneous-semantic cross-dependency encoding.

Result: Experimental results on a large-scale semi-simulated dataset show SIKNet outperforms traditional Kalman filters and existing learning-aided filters in both robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: SIKNet provides superior motion estimation performance for multi-object tracking by effectively handling semantic-independent encoding and nonlinear dependencies, making it more robust to parameter mismatches and non-stationary motion.

Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

### [145] [Toward Next-generation Medical Vision Backbones: Modeling Finer-grained Long-range Visual Dependency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11328)
*Mingyuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This doctoral research investigates long-range visual dependency modeling in medical image computing, comparing transformers and MLPs, finding MLPs superior for fine-grained dependency modeling in high-resolution medical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image computing requires models that capture both global context and local subtle details, but existing approaches (CNNs limited by locality, transformers limited by computational load) struggle with fine-grained long-range dependency modeling in high-resolution medical images.

Method: The research presents innovative use of transformers for pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks, then pioneers MLP-based visual models to capture fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images through extensive experiments.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling and reveal that MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing enriched anatomical/pathological details.

Conclusion: MLPs establish as a superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation medical vision backbones.

Abstract: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

*Sriram Narayanan,Mani Ramanagopal,Srinivasa G. Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First method to separate reflected and emitted light components in thermal videos using dual-band thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities, enabling accurate estimation of surface emissivity and time-varying temperature in near-ambient conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In near-ambient conditions relevant to computer vision, both reflected environmental light and emitted surface light are comparable and vary over time, but previous thermography methods either assume one component dominates or treat the second as constant. Accurate separation is essential for understanding object properties like emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape.

Method: Developed a dual-band thermal image formation model using two thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities. Created algorithms to estimate surface emissivity and time-varying temperature while isolating dynamic background components.

Result: Quantitatively evaluated using carefully calibrated emissivities for various materials. Showed qualitative results on complex everyday scenes including glass with hot liquid and people moving in background. Successfully separated reflected and emitted light components.

Conclusion: The introduced method provides the first effective approach for separating reflected and emitted light components in thermal videos, enabling accurate property estimation in challenging near-ambient conditions where both components are significant and dynamic.

Abstract: Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two
components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a
surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport
through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment.
Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties
such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography
studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or
that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in
near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision
applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary
over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted
components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different
spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and
develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying
temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate
our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials
and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled
with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

### [147] [Beyond Instance Consistency: Investigating View Diversity in Self-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11344)
*Huaiyuan Qin,Muli Yang,Siyuan Hu,Peng Hu,Yu Zhang,Chen Gong,Hongyuan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL can learn meaningful representations even without strict instance consistency in positive pairs. Moderate view diversity improves performance, while excessive diversity reduces effectiveness. EMD helps measure optimal view diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SSL assumes instance consistency where different views of the same image are positive pairs, but this breaks down for non-iconic data where views may contain different objects or semantic information.

Method: Extensive ablation studies analyzing SSL performance when instance consistency is not guaranteed. Used Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure mutual information between views and quantify view diversity.

Result: SSL still learns meaningful representations without strict instance consistency. Increasing view diversity (zero overlapping or smaller crop scales) enhances downstream performance on classification and dense prediction tasks, but excessive diversity reduces effectiveness. Moderate EMD values correlate with improved SSL learning.

Conclusion: There is an optimal range for view diversity in SSL frameworks. EMD serves as an effective estimator for measuring mutual information between views, providing insights for future SSL framework design on diverse data sources.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance
consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be
treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic
data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic
information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when
instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when
positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis
further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping
or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on
classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is
found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity.
To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to
measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values
correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL
framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings,
highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

*Robin Narsingh Ranabhat,Longwei Wang,Amit Kumar Patel,KC santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two regularization methods to make CNNs more robust to image corruptions by encouraging shape-based rather than texture-based representations, improving performance on CIFAR-10-C without sacrificing clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to common image corruptions that humans handle easily because they rely too much on local texture cues rather than global object shapes like human perception does.

Method: 1) Auxiliary loss enforcing feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs to reduce dependence on high-frequency textures. 2) Supervised contrastive learning to structure feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.

Result: Both methods improved corruption robustness on CIFAR-10-C benchmark while maintaining clean accuracy, demonstrating effective enhancement of shape-aware representations.

Conclusion: Loss-level regularization can successfully steer CNNs toward more shape-biased and resilient representations, making them more robust to common image corruptions.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain
vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for
this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global
object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we
propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage
shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an
auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and
low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency
textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure
the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.
Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption
robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that
loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,
resilient representations.

*Wan Xu,Feng Zhu,Yihan Zeng,Yuanfan Guo,Ming Liu,Hang Xu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLaVE-Cap is a novel video captioning framework that addresses limitations in current local-to-global approaches by introducing TrackFusion for comprehensive local caption generation and CaptionBridge for local-global interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current local-to-global video captioning paradigms produce less detailed and contextually inconsistent captions due to lack of fine-grained captioning mechanisms and weak interaction between local and global captions.

Method: Proposes GLaVE-Cap with two core modules: TrackFusion leverages vision experts for cross-frame visual prompts with dual-stream structure, and CaptionBridge establishes local-global interaction using global context to guide local captioning and adaptive summarization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, with ablation studies validating module effectiveness. Also creates GLaVE-Bench (5X more queries per video) and GLaVE-1.2M dataset (16K fine-grained captions + 1.2M QA pairs).

Conclusion: GLaVE-Cap effectively addresses detailed captioning challenges through global-local alignment and vision expert integration, providing valuable resources (benchmark and dataset) for the video understanding community.

Abstract: Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions
to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed
captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which
first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a
global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and
contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism
to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and
global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a
Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning,
which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local
caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual
prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes
a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning,
and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption.
Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark
featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse
visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a
training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video
captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the
video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and
dataset will be open-sourced.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error of 12.55 microns on wrinkle-like test objects. Validated wrinkle depth metrics across multiple body regions in 15 participants, and demonstrated statistically significant wrinkle height reduction after moisturizer application.

Conclusion: Provides a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin analysis with applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and skincare efficacy evaluation.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for
objective and quantitative dermatological assessment, but no portable,
high-resolution device exists that has been validated and used for depth

TL;DR: MixANT is a novel architecture that introduces dynamic input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms using mixture of experts to improve long-term human activity anticipation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current State Space Models like Mamba have static forget-gate parameters that limit their ability to adapt to different temporal contexts in human activity prediction.

Method: Proposes a mixture of experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant A matrices (forget-gates) based on input features while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets show MixANT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms are crucial for reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios, and MixANT effectively addresses this need.

Abstract: We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense
anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like
Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key
parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal
memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of
experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$
matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without
sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads,
Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our
results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for
reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hypernetwork-based method for handling missing modalities in multi-modal medical imaging, outperforming standard approaches by up to 8% accuracy with incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical multi-modal medical imaging often has incomplete data, and current methods (discarding samples, imputation, or dropout) limit robustness and generalizability.

Method: A hypernetwork that dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on available modalities, learning to predict parameters of task models adapted to whatever modalities are present.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with absolute accuracy increase up to 8% when trained on dataset with 25% completeness (75% missing modalities).

Conclusion: Enables single model to generalize across all modality configurations, providing efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis with missing data.

Abstract: In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning
models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially
incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require
imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and
generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that
dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the
set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork
learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available
modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of
completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete
data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based
method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze
robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of
our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase
in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of
training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to
generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an
efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

*Nikolaos Zioulis,Nikolaos Kotarelas,Georgios Albanis,Spyridon Thermos,Anargyros Chatzitofis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes weighted rotation blending with quaternion averaging to fix Gaussian deformation artifacts in human avatar animation, replacing complex corrective methods with a simple modification to linear blend skinning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian splatting methods for human avatars suffer from artifacts when using linear blend skinning for deformation, as it doesn't properly handle the non-linear rotation properties of Gaussians. Existing solutions require complex mesh properties or corrective offset training.

Method: Uses weighted rotation blending approach based on quaternion averaging to properly handle Gaussian rotations during deformation. This modifies only the linear blend skinning technique and works with any Gaussian rasterizer.

Result: Creates simpler vertex-based Gaussians that can be efficiently animated and integrated into any engine without complex corrective models or mesh property dependencies.

Conclusion: The proposed quaternion-based rotation blending provides a straightforward solution to Gaussian deformation artifacts, enabling efficient human avatar animation while maintaining compatibility with existing Gaussian rasterizers and engines.

Abstract: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying

TL;DR: A method to disentangle biological and technical factors in medical imaging data using latent space rotation, improving cluster consistency and enabling better biomarker discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data contains both biological differences and technical variations from different imaging technologies, which creates domain shifts that impede learning meaningful representations and discovering disease patterns.

Method: An approach that actively learns domain shift via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space to disentangle biological and technical factors, creating stable clusters across different acquisition settings.

Result: Cluster consistency improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. Enhanced Cox survival prediction when quantifying tissue composition.

Conclusion: The proposed label-free framework facilitates biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data by effectively disentangling biological and technical factors through latent space rotation.

Abstract: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the
help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of recognizable findings. This
supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies
not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology
linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting
domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery
of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we
introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation
of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical
factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the
learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing
tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is
improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the
entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization
methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival
prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates
biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data. Code is available on

TL;DR: A masked autoencoder approach for handling missing MRI sequences in 3D medical imaging, using multi-modal multi-task learning with late-fusion transformers to reconstruct missing data and improve downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing challenges for deep learning models that require complete input data. The need for robust methods that can handle incomplete MRI data while maintaining performance.

Method: Developed a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm inspired by MultiMAE, treating each MRI sequence as separate modality.

Conclusion: The method provides a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that can infer missing sequences from available inputs and adapt to various downstream applications, showing strong pretraining strategy effectiveness.

Abstract: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a
challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this
work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm
for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our
method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a
late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information
(multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task
reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich
representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs
through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable
encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and
can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the
performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in
downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement
of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing
input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining
strategy. The implementation is made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajTrack is a lightweight LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking framework that combines explicit motion proposals with implicit trajectory learning from historical bounding box data, achieving state-of-the-art performance at 56 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D SOT methods face a dilemma: two-frame methods lack temporal context and perform poorly in sparse/occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods are robust but computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes trajectory-based paradigm with TrajTrack framework that enhances base two-frame trackers by learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone, without additional point cloud inputs. Uses explicit motion proposal followed by implicit motion modeling to predict future trajectory.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on NuScenes benchmark with 4.48% precision improvement over strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Demonstrates strong generalizability across different base trackers.

Conclusion: TrajTrack resolves the efficiency-robustness dilemma in 3D SOT by leveraging trajectory-based learning, offering both high performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics
and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion
estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are
efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse
or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point
clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this
dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,
TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame
tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box
trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It
first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit
motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines
and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong
baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionNet is an end-to-end infrared and visible image fusion framework that uses modality-aware attention and pixel-wise alpha blending to dynamically integrate complementary features while preserving semantic information through target-aware loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to combine structural and textural information from different spectral domains, but existing methods lack explicit modeling of inter-modality interactions and semantic preservation in critical regions.

Method: Proposes FusionNet with modality-aware attention mechanism, pixel-wise alpha blending module for adaptive fusion weights, and target-aware loss using weak ROI supervision to maintain semantic consistency in important object regions.

Result: Experiments on M3FD dataset show FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability, benefiting downstream tasks like object detection.

Conclusion: FusionNet provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion that effectively integrates complementary spectral information while preserving critical semantic content.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal
perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues
from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel
end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction
and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware
attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and
visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve
fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha
blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive
and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that
leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions
containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the
public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with
enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear
interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for
semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks
such as object detection and scene understanding.

*Wenhao Tang,Sheng Huang,Heng Fang,Fengtao Zhou,Bo Liu,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MHIM-MIL is a novel Multiple Instance Learning framework that uses masked hard instance mining with a Siamese structure to identify challenging instances in Whole Slide Images, outperforming existing methods in cancer diagnosis and related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods in computational pathology focus on easy-to-classify instances via attention mechanisms, creating bias and neglecting hard examples that are crucial for accurate discriminative boundary modeling.

Method: Uses a Siamese structure with consistency constraint, momentum teacher to mask salient instances, class-aware instance probability, large-scale random masking, and global recycle network to mine diverse hard instances while preserving key features.

Result: Outperforms latest methods in performance and efficiency across cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks on 12 benchmarks.

Conclusion: MHIM-MIL effectively addresses the bias towards easy instances in MIL frameworks and demonstrates superior performance by focusing on hard instance mining for improved computational pathology applications.

Abstract: Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has
opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue
comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via
attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify
instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that
hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.
Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework
with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure
with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a
class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask
salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale
random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of
losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an
exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent
training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer
diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate
that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and
efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

TL;DR: SFGNet introduces semantic prompts and frequency-domain features for camouflaged object detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing camouflaged object detection studies overlook semantic differences in textual prompts and fine-grained frequency features, leading to suboptimal performance in complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries.

Method: Proposes Semantic and Frequency Guided Network (SFGNet) with Multi-Band Fourier Module (MBFM) for handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries, and Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) for maintaining structural integrity and boundary details.

Result: Extensive experiments on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that SFGNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The integration of semantic prompts and frequency-domain features effectively improves camouflaged object detection and boundary perception, making SFGNet a superior solution for this challenging task.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into
their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic
differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained
frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency
Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and
frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary
perception. We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the
ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries.
In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to
ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive
experiments conducted on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The core code of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs have latent GUI grounding potential but underperform on explicit coordinate output. Three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods using spatial cues (axes, grids, labeled intersections) are proposed to bridge this gap without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General vision-language models struggle with GUI grounding tasks despite having latent spatial understanding capabilities, and current fine-tuning approaches require high data/annotation costs.

Method: Three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods that provide explicit spatial cues (axes, grids, and labeled intersections) as part of the input image to help VLMs articulate their implicit spatial understanding.

Result: Evaluation on four GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs shows substantial performance improvements in GUI grounding.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot methods effectively bridge the gap between VLMs' latent spatial understanding and explicit coordinate output capabilities for GUI grounding without requiring expensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building
GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this
task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this
paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as
demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform
when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy,
and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning
approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By
providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections
as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their
implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four
GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve
the performance of GUI grounding.

*Zhexi Peng,Kun Zhou,Tianjia Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPS-SLAM combines Gaussian and SDF representations to achieve real-time 3D reconstruction at 150+ fps, providing 10x speedup over current Gaussian-based SLAM methods while maintaining comparable quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian-based SLAM methods are computationally intensive (under 20 fps), lagging far behind geometry-centric approaches (hundreds of fps) due to the heavy computational burden of modeling scenes with numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization.

Method: Proposes a Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation: uses colorized Signed Distance Field (SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance (efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion), while 3D Gaussians capture underrepresented details through iterative optimization. This enables 50% fewer Gaussians and 75% fewer optimization iterations.

Result: GPS-SLAM achieves over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect sequences, delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The hybrid representation successfully addresses the computational bottleneck of Gaussian-based SLAM, enabling real-time performance without sacrificing reconstruction quality, with plans to release source code and data for future research.

Abstract: While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic
reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a
critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps,
significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion
(hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden:
modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization
to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization
iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a
Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field
(SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture
underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion
(as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative
optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer)
by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization
(75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon
this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time
3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect
sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art
techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release
the source code and data to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL) framework with Multi-Center Contrastive Learning and Bidirectional Reverse Selection Transmission to address fine-grained variations in unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised VI-ReID methods using cluster-based contrastive learning represent each person by a single cluster center, neglecting finer-grained differences among images within clusters.

Method: HIL framework with secondary clustering to generate multiple memories per cluster, MCCL for representation refinement, and BRST mechanism for bidirectional pseudo-label matching to establish reliable cross-modal correspondences.

Result: Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed HIL framework effectively addresses fine-grained variations in unsupervised cross-modal person re-identification, achieving state-of-the-art results by capturing both commonality and differences within clusters through hierarchical learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to
learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person
datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly
manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using
cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single
cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images
within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them.
To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL)
framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that
reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for
each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally,
we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations
for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies.
To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional
Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable
cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of
pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

Motivation: Address the need for performance prioritization in safety-critical scenarios where certain classes (like 'Human') are more important than others, and overcome limitations of uniform class distributions that may not optimize model reliability.

Method: An iterative framework that identifies Pareto optimized class distributions by determining the optimal number of images per class to minimize bias and variance. Can be integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and supports any labeled multi-class dataset.

Result: Validated on EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt using CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets, demonstrating improved and balanced model performance through optimized data distribution.

Conclusion: BiCDO provides an effective data-centric approach for optimizing class distributions in multi-class classification, enabling targeted performance improvements for critical classes while maintaining overall model balance and reliability.

Abstract: We propose BiCDO (Bias-Controlled Class Distribution Optimizer), an
iterative, data-centric framework that identifies Pareto optimized class
distributions for multi-class image classification. BiCDO enables performance
prioritization for specific classes, which is useful in safety-critical
scenarios (e.g. prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog'). Unlike uniform distributions,
BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability
and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be
incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and
supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using
EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets,
demonstrating improved, balanced model performance through optimized data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VQA methods produce single numerical scores that lack comprehensiveness and interpretability, while video generation models like Sora require better quality assessment for large-scale datasets.

Method: Created MVQA-68K dataset with over 68,000 videos annotated across seven quality dimensions (aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail, composition, visual quality, factual consistency) with chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Significantly enhances MLLM performance on VQA tasks, achieving SOTA results on internal test set and public benchmarks (LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, LIVE-VQC). Explicit reasoning process boosts zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: MVQA-68K addresses limitations of traditional VQA by providing multi-dimensional annotations with detailed reasoning, substantially improving video quality assessment performance and interpretability.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video
quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting
high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional
VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack
comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over
68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions:
overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail,
composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes
detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and
comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K
significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on
our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including
LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning
process during VQA training substantially boosts the zero-shot generalization.

*Siming Fu,Sijun Dong,Xiaoliang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGDL is a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that addresses shortcut learning in SSL by enforcing explicit content-style disentanglement through an invariance pre-training principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning suffers from shortcut learning where models exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure, which hinders generalization to unseen domains. Existing methods only address this superficially without changing the underlying learning mechanism.

Method: Proposes HyGDL framework with single encoder that analytically defines style as orthogonal component to style-invariant content via vector projection. Uses invariance pre-training principle: systematically varying bias (style) while keeping supervision constant to force learning invariant essence.

Result: Not explicitly stated in abstract, but framework enables explicit content-style disentanglement to address shortcut learning at its core.

Conclusion: HyGDL provides a fundamental solution to shortcut learning by altering the learning mechanism itself through hybrid generative-discriminative approach with analytical style-content separation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its
generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models
exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We
experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and
argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying
it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods
often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific
features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters
shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid
Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves
explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the
Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant
essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while
keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and
analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is
orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

Motivation: Existing video anomaly detection benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level tasks, which restricts a holistic view of model generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposes a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that balances sampling across temporal scales by prioritizing anomaly-dense segments while ensuring full-video coverage. Constructs two benchmarks: image-based for frame-level reasoning and video-based for temporally localized segments with abnormality scoring.

Result: Experiments on UCF-Crime dataset show improvements at both frame and video levels. Ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed frame allocation strategy and complementary benchmarks provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework for video anomaly detection, enabling better assessment of model generalization across different temporal scales.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level
tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first
introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes
anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced
sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two
complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level
reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends
to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring
task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and
video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused
sampling over uniform and random baselines.

TL;DR: A 3D deepfake framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for realistic face swapping and reenactment with multi-view consistency and precise control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of 2D deepfake methods that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and poor generalization to novel views, enabling more realistic 3D-aware manipulations.

Method: Combines parametric head model with dynamic Gaussian representations, separates head/background Gaussians, uses pre-trained 2D guidance for optimization, and includes a repair module for extreme poses/expressions.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D methods in identity preservation and expression consistency, while significantly outperforming in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency.

Conclusion: Bridges 3D modeling with deepfake synthesis, enabling scene-aware and immersive visual forgeries, while highlighting security threats of 3D Gaussian Splatting for manipulation attacks.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and
reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D
deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited
generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with
dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering,
precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address
editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the
head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the
facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance
visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on
NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity
preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly
outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our
approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling
new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries,
revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be
used for manipulation attacks.

TL;DR: IS-Diff is a training-free diffusion model that uses initial seeds from unmasked areas to improve inpainting consistency and coherence, avoiding mismatched semantic information from random noise initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random noise initialization in vanilla diffusion models can introduce mismatched semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results with low consistency and coherence with unmasked areas.

Method: Proposes Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model (IS-Diff) that samples initial seeds from unmasked areas to imitate masked data distribution, plus a dynamic selective refinement mechanism to detect and adjust unharmonious inpaintings during the diffusion process.

Result: Validated on CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and Places2 datasets for standard and large-mask inpainting tasks, showing effectiveness across all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IS-Diff provides a training-free approach that produces more harmonious inpainting results by using distributional harmonious seeds from unmasked regions, addressing the limitations of random initialization in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent
studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led
to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization
seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched
semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results,
e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To
address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model
(IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional
harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs
initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data
distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion
procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to
detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the
strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on
both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet,
and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics
compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

Abstract: Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle
multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly
trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However,
these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain
characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development
and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale,
real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck
in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains
image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow,
and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The
resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images,
enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and
all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable
foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in
real-world scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released and is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tableware cleaning methods suffer from coarse-grained classification and few-shot data scarcity, making them inadequate for industrialization requirements in food safety and smart home applications.

Method: DTGen uses generative diffusion models with LoRA for efficient domain specialization, structured prompts for diverse dirty image generation, and CLIP-based cross-modal filtering to ensure data quality.

Result: Under extremely limited few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize unlimited high-quality samples, significantly improving classifier performance for fine-grained dirty tableware recognition.

Conclusion: DTGen validates generative AI's value in few-shot industrial vision and provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring, with potential for embedded dishwasher integration.

Abstract: Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and
smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification
and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization
requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on
generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty
tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through
LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data
quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real
few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality
samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting
fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight
deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded
dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate
energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen
not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but
also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and
food safety monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindVL is a multimodal LLM trained on Ascend NPUs that achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL with 1/10th the training data, featuring native-resolution vision processing and optimized training framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient multimodal language model that can process images at native variable resolutions without degradation, particularly for visually dense content like charts and diagrams, while being optimized for Ascend NPUs.

Method: Uses native-resolution Vision Transformers, three-phase training (warm-up, multitask training, supervised instruction tuning), multimodal data packaging, hybrid parallelism, test-time resolution search, and model weight averaging. Developed Mindspeed-MLLM framework for Ascend NPU optimization.

Result: Achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension despite using only 1/10th of the training data. Delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.

Conclusion: MindVL demonstrates that efficient training strategies and native-resolution processing can achieve state-of-the-art multimodal performance with significantly less training data, making it particularly effective for complex visual content analysis.

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance
in OCR assessments.

Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation benchmarks use everyday textured objects, limiting generalization to industrial scenarios where objects are metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective.

Method: Created IMD dataset with 45 true-to-scale industrial components captured using RGB-D camera under natural lighting and varied arrangements. Evaluated state-of-the-art models including XMem, SAM2 for segmentation, and BundleTrack, BundleSDF for pose estimation.

Result: The industrial dataset proved more challenging than existing household object datasets, revealing performance limitations of current models in industrial contexts.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides a baseline for developing segmentation and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics scenarios.

Abstract: Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception,
especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the
environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D
pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and
low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where
objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address
this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial
Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset
comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera
under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate
real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video
object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We
evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for
segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess
model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our
industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets.
This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles improve medical image segmentation but increase training and testing costs with more ensembles. Need for efficient uncertainty estimation in retinal vessel analysis.

Method: Propose Ensemble Distillation to distill knowledge from multiple ensemble models into a single model, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance.

Result: Achieves comparable performance via calibration and segmentation metrics on DRIVE and FIVES datasets while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: Ensemble Distillation provides an efficient and reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in retinal vessel segmentation, making it promising for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation,
particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are
essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks
are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation
performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of
ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust
alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling
the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through
extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that
Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and
segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and

TL;DR: Depthwise separable CNNs naturally converge to just 8 universal filters that are linear shifts of fundamental patterns like DoGs and Gaussians, achieving strong performance even when frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the Master Key Filters Hypothesis by showing that DS-CNNs inherently converge to a minimal set of universal spatial operators regardless of task or architecture.

Method: Systematic unsupervised search across different architectures and datasets to extract fundamental filter patterns, then testing networks initialized with these 8 frozen filters.

Result: Networks with just 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80% ImageNet accuracy and outperform models with thousands of trainable parameters on smaller datasets.

Conclusion: Depthwise convolutional layers naturally gravitate toward fundamental spatial operators similar to classical image processing and biological visual systems, providing insights for generalization and transfer learning.

Abstract: A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for
convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by
radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters
that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While
conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis
reveals these filters are predominantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered
universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these
fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably,
networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80%
ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable
parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters
closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives,
structures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also
strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our
findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers
naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless
of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for understanding
generalization and transfer learning through the universal language of these
master key filters.

hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level
and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts
and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare
outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative
ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease
diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction,

TL;DR: Proposes MSMA framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained images using multi-scale feature fusion and multi-attribute learning with large-kernel attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with detailed feature capture under diverse conditions and require extensive 3D data, which is costly to obtain. Projection-based losses alone are insufficient for accurate reconstructions.

Method: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework that integrates multi-scale feature fusion, multi-attribute learning, and large-kernel attention module for precise feature extraction across scales.

Result: Achieves results on par with state-of-the-art methods and surpasses SOTA performance in some challenging conditions on MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MSMA framework effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by better capturing detailed and multi-scale features under diverse facial attributes and conditions.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a
challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively
capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.
Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between
generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based
methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D
facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce
reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ
projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model
training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches
frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse
facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with
Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained
images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on
multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to
enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D
facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments
on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate
that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging
conditions.

operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object
identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in
foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot
generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS
(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and
memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that
integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module
to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The
proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic.
Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that
Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth
overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a
new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window
memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance
degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results
confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot
tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization. The

*Changlu Guo,Anders Nymark Christensen,Anders Bjorholm Dahl,Yugen Yi,Morten Rieger Hannemose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-UNetv2 improves retinal vessel segmentation by adding cross-scale spatial attention to skip connections and using a weighted BCE+MCC loss to handle class imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SA-UNet underutilizes attention in skip connections and fails to address severe foreground-background imbalance in retinal vessel segmentation, which is crucial for early disease diagnosis.

Method: Proposes SA-UNetv2 with cross-scale spatial attention in all skip connections for better multi-scale feature fusion, and a weighted BCE plus MCC loss function to improve robustness to class imbalance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DRIVE and STARE datasets with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592x592x3 images.

Conclusion: SA-UNetv2 demonstrates strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained, CPU-only settings for retinal vessel segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such
as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders.
Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses
attention in skip connections and does not address the severe
foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that
injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen
multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class
imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less
than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images,
demonstrating strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained,
CPU-only settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineQuest is a training-free framework for sports VideoQA that uses dual-mode reasoning (reactive and deliberative) and a multimodal sports knowledge scene graph (SSGraph) to achieve state-of-the-art performance on sports benchmarks while maintaining general VideoQA capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoQA based on LLMs struggles with the complexity of sports videos due to domain-specific knowledge requirements and the inherent challenges of sports understanding.

Method: Proposes FineQuest framework with dual-mode reasoning: reactive for simple queries and deliberative for complex ones. Incorporates SSGraph - a multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning 9 sports with visual instances and domain terminology. Introduces two new benchmarks: Gym-QA and Diving-QA.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on new benchmarks (Gym-QA, Diving-QA) and existing SPORTU dataset while maintaining strong general VideoQA capabilities.

Conclusion: FineQuest demonstrates that training-free frameworks with cognitive-inspired dual reasoning and domain-specific knowledge graphs can effectively address the challenges of sports VideoQA without sacrificing general video understanding performance.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
shown potential in general video understanding but faces significant challenges
when applied to the inherently complex domain of sports videos. In this work,
we propose FineQuest, the first training-free framework that leverages
dual-mode reasoning inspired by cognitive science: i) Reactive Reasoning for
straightforward sports queries and ii) Deliberative Reasoning for more complex
ones. To bridge the knowledge gap between general-purpose models and
domain-specific sports understanding, FineQuest incorporates SSGraph, a
multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning nine sports, which encodes
both visual instances and domain-specific terminology to enhance reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce two new sports VideoQA benchmarks, Gym-QA
and Diving-QA, derived from the FineGym and FineDiving datasets, enabling
diverse and comprehensive evaluation. FineQuest achieves state-of-the-art
performance on these benchmarks as well as the existing SPORTU dataset, while
maintains strong general VideoQA capabilities.

*Ang Nan Gu,Michael Tsang,Hooman Vaseli,Purang Abolmaesumi,Teresa Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that uses neural network training dynamics to generate uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels for medical image diagnosis, addressing the problem of overconfident predictions from simplistic one-hot labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-aided diagnosis systems use overly simplistic one-hot labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty and inter-rater variability, leading to overconfident predictions especially with noisy or ambiguous medical images.

Method: Leverages neural network training dynamics to assess sample difficulty, aggregates and calibrates model predictions during training to generate uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect diagnostic ambiguity.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on echocardiography classification benchmark, outperforming specialized baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware label augmentation framework is architecture-agnostic and enhances uncertainty estimation and robustness in medical image diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical
images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are
trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot
labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident
predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We
address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back
into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics
(NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By
aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during
learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be
applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation
and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography
classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized
baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LFRA-Net is a lightweight retinal vessel segmentation network that uses focal modulation attention and region-aware attention to achieve high accuracy with minimal computational resources (0.17M parameters, 0.66MB memory).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for retinal vessel segmentation struggle with extracting tiny vessels and have high computational costs, making them unsuitable for real-world clinical settings with limited resources.

Method: Incorporates focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware attention in selective skip connections to enhance feature representation and regional focus by capturing local and global dependencies.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art models on DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB datasets with Dice scores of 84.28%, 88.44%, 85.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.86%, 79.31%, 74.70% respectively, while maintaining lightweight characteristics.

Conclusion: LFRA-Net provides an ideal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications in resource-limited areas.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of
vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical
settings with limited computational resources. Although significant
improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods,
current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from
high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating
focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware
attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network
optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances
feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and
global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while
maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66
MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available
datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice
score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and
74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net
provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost
compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for
real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources. The code can

*Haiduo Huang,Fuwei Yang,Zhenhua Liu,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Pengju Ren,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM accelerates vision-language models using speculative decoding with an elastic visual compressor and online training protocol, achieving 2.5-2.9x speedups while maintaining lossless decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of speculative decoding to VLMs faces challenges due to visual token dominance in prefill stage, causing compute and memory inefficiencies especially with KV cache scaling with image resolution and video length.

Method: Introduces EagleVLM baseline (1.5-2.3x speedup) and SpecVLM with elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects compression primitives (pruning, pooling, convolution, resampler). Uses online-logit distillation protocol with cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective for draft model training without offline data.

Result: Achieves 2.5-2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU models, consistent across resolutions and task difficulties while preserving target model's output distribution (lossless decoding).

Conclusion: SpecVLM provides a practical system for accelerating VLMs through speculative decoding with adaptive visual compression and efficient online training, demonstrating significant speed improvements without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large
language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models
(VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by
visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length,
inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We
study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system
that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering
1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)
further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that
adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler
primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly
offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol
that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate
features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating
storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol
reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically
increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative
efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating
in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU,
consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the
target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available

*Liying Wang,Xiaoli Zhang,Chuanmin Jia,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAFS is a unified network for infrared-visible image fusion and semantic segmentation that enables reciprocal promotion between pixel-level fusion and feature-level perception tasks through a parallel structure with heterogeneous feature fusion and multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic-driven fusion methods inject semantic information but fail to explore the reciprocal promotion potential between pixel-wise image fusion and cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level perspective.

Method: Proposes a parallel structure with fusion and segmentation sub-networks, uses heterogeneous feature fusion strategy for semantic-aware fusion, cascades fusion sub-network with segmentation backbone for knowledge transfer, designs multi-stage Transformer decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation, and introduces dynamic factor for adaptive multi-task weighting.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in both image fusion quality and semantic segmentation performance.

Conclusion: MAFS successfully bridges the gap between pixel-level fusion and feature-level perception tasks, achieving mutual enhancement through its unified framework and demonstrating effectiveness through comprehensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with
good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks.
Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information
injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the
potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and
cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level
perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image
fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a
fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a
heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities
for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a
segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote
feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a
novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale
fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min
fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two
tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared
with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: A scalable probabilistic verification framework for semantic segmentation networks that combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference to provide reliable safety guarantees while reducing conservatism in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with modern segmentation tasks' complexity and dimensionality, yielding impractical conservative guarantees for safety-critical applications like medical imaging and autonomous driving.

Method: Combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference, introducing novel strategies to reduce conservatism in high-dimensional settings while maintaining rigor.

Result: Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation models across multiple datasets (CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, Cityscapes) shows reliable safety guarantees with substantially tighter bounds compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides architecture-agnostic, scalable probabilistic verification for semantic segmentation networks with practical safety guarantees, accompanied by an open-source toolbox implementation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety
hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing
probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and
dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are
too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification
framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional
outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with
conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the
excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in
high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism
without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation
models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates
that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially
tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this
technique, available on Github.

TL;DR: This paper bridges generative vision-language models with dense alignment methods by using synthetic descriptions from VLMs for improved zero-shot segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative VLMs lack spatially dense vision-language alignment, while existing dense alignment methods need better semantic understanding. The authors aim to combine these approaches.

Method: Densely align images with synthetic descriptions generated by vision-language models. Use these inexpensive, scalable synthetic captions as a source of high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods.

Result: Outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks/datasets while being more data-efficient.

Conclusion: Synthetic captions from VLMs provide an effective and scalable way to achieve dense vision-language alignment, bridging generative capabilities with representation learning for improved segmentation performance.

Abstract: Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image
understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language
modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative
VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for
vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like
segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning
images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are
inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of
high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our
approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count by 50% while maintaining rendering quality through segmentation-driven initialization for sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with sparse-view synthesis due to SfM limitations and high memory costs from massive Gaussian generation in MVS-based approaches.

Method: Leverages region-based segmentation to identify structurally significant regions, enabling selective downsampling of dense point clouds to reduce Gaussian count while preserving fidelity.

Result: Reduces Gaussian count by up to 50%, achieves comparable/superior PSNR and SSIM with marginal LPIPS degradation, enables faster training and lower memory footprint.

Conclusion: SDI-GS advances 3DGS practicality for constrained-view scenarios through efficient segmentation-driven initialization that maintains quality while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of
recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time
rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that
struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods
replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers
of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high
memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian
Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging
region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant
regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,
preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.
Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count
by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and
SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster
training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for
constrained-view scenarios.

Motivation: Current vision language models for video QA rely on shallow correlations and have weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. Symbolic scene graphs can provide structured object-relation representations to complement VLM reasoning.

Method: SG-VLM is a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding through prompting and visual localization techniques.

Result: Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited.

Conclusion: Symbolic scene graphs show promise for improving video understanding but have current limitations, offering guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial,
temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs)
achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak
temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs
(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured
object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We
introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene
graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks
(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM
improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though
gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance
video understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from
hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address
this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,

TL;DR: MOT methods outperform traditional MAT tools for long-term pig tracking, showing potential for improved livestock monitoring accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision livestock farming needs better monitoring tools, and while existing MAT tools are user-friendly, they underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, leading to inaccurate behavior analysis and health monitoring.

Method: Benchmarked both MAT (DeepLabCut, idTracker) and MOT (ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, Track-Anything, PromptTrack) approaches on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset.

Result: MOT approaches overall outperformed traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: Recent MOT techniques have significant potential to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking systems.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the
increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of
long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral
monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object
tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific
issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among
animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.
  While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they
often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result
in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state
estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT
and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as
DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT,
cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and
PromptTrack.
  All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results
demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools,
even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential
of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated
livestock tracking.

TL;DR: A novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique for zero-shot image generation from poems, using diffusion models and LLMs to dynamically adjust word importance for better visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poetry invites multiple interpretations based on readers' emotions and backgrounds, so the goal is to generate and modify images for poems in a zero-shot setting to accommodate different audience requirements.

Method: Introduces Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) that systematically modifies attention weights and text embeddings in diffusion models, dynamically adjusting word importance. Uses diffusion models and LLMs (like GPT) with poetry datasets.

Result: WPM enhances or suppresses specific word influence, leading to semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations of poetic language.

Conclusion: This represents the first integration of weighted prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetry, providing a comprehensive methodology for improved literary image generation.

Abstract: Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as
readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds
into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images
for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences
to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a
novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically
modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By
dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or
suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to
semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach
exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in
conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and
structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted
prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

TL;DR: SAM-TTT enhances Segment Anything Model for camouflaged object detection by suppressing adverse parameters and reinforcing advantageous ones using reverse parameter configuration and test-time training layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based COD models focus on enhancing favorable features but neglect adverse parameters that impair semantic understanding in downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes Reverse SAM Parameter Configuration Module to mitigate adverse parameters in train-free manner, and T-Visioner Module that integrates test-time training layers (linear complexity sequence modeling) to strengthen advantageous parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various COD benchmarks, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD tasks.

Conclusion: SAM-TTT sets new benchmark in camouflaged object detection by simultaneously suppressing adverse parameters while reinforcing advantageous ones through innovative parameter configuration and test-time training integration.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages
reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its
performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most
existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting
favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is
identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's
semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse
SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the
influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's
parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to
strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,
originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training
layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by
linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,
SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing
advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD
task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new
benchmark in the field. The code will be available at

### [197] [BREA-Depth: Bronchoscopy Realistic Airway-geometric Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11885)
*Francis Xiatian Zhang,Emile Mackute,Mohammadreza Kasaei,Kevin Dhaliwal,Robert Thomson,Mohsen Khadem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brea-Depth is a novel framework that integrates airway-specific geometric priors into depth foundation models for bronchoscopic depth estimation, addressing the lack of anatomical awareness in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth foundation models for bronchoscopy lack anatomical awareness, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing global airway structure, especially under ambiguous depth cues and poor lighting conditions.

Method: Proposes Brea-Depth framework with: 1) depth-aware CycleGAN to bridge domain gap between real bronchoscopic images and airway geometries, 2) airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth consistency within airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on both collected ex vivo human lung dataset and open bronchoscopic dataset, achieving better anatomical depth preservation and more robust 3D airway reconstructions.

Conclusion: Brea-Depth successfully enhances model generalization by incorporating anatomical priors and introduces a new evaluation metric (Airway Depth Structure Evaluation) for assessing structural consistency in bronchoscopic depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve
real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in
complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have
shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical
awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing
the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor
lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that
integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation
for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware
CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway
geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In
addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth
consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and
structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances
model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway
reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth
Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate
BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic
dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth
preservation.

### [198] [Logit Mixture Outlier Exposure for Fine-grained Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11892)
*Akito Shinohara,Kohei Fukuda,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes logit-space linear interpolation mixing in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to improve OOD detection performance, particularly for near-boundary OOD samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods like Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier Exposure still struggle with learning effective class relationships and clearly distinguishing between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, especially for samples near decision boundaries.

Method: Linear interpolation technique in logit space that mixes in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to smooth logits between classes. Also enforces consistency between logits from logit-space mixing and input-space mixing.

Result: Reduces abrupt fluctuations in model outputs near decision boundaries, resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Effective for fine-grained OOD detection tasks.

Conclusion: Logit-space mixing technique significantly improves OOD detection performance by creating smoother decision boundaries and better handling of near-boundary OOD samples through consistent interpolation in both logit and input spaces.

Abstract: The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for
ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for
improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various
out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier
Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection
performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with
these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the
relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from
in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the
logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are
distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,
we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits
between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,
particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution
data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through
mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.
Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the
abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,
resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

*Marian Renz,Felix Igelbrink,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3D semantic scene graph prediction that integrates multi-modal information like prior observations and semantic embeddings without requiring complete scene reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D semantic scene graph methods rely mainly on sensor data and assume complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world incremental settings where partial information is available.

Method: Heterogeneous graph model that integrates multi-modal information (prior observations, semantic embeddings like CLIP) directly into message-passing process using multiple layers to incorporate global and local scene representations without specialized modules.

Result: Evaluation on 3DSSG dataset shows that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information offer scalable and generalizable solutions for complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: The approach provides a flexible framework for incremental 3DSSG prediction that works without full scene reconstructions and integrates diverse information sources, making it suitable for real-world robotics and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: 3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations
of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships.
While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing
methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from
semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to
complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world,
incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model
for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal
information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing
process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and
local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene
reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that
GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,
CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for
complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented
architecture will be made available at

*Zilin Li,Weiwei Xu,Xuanqi Zhao,Yiran Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroGaze-Distill transfers brain-informed priors from EEG data to image-only FER models using static valence/arousal prototypes and depression-inspired geometric regularization, improving cross-dataset generalization without requiring EEG signals at deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER models trained only on pixels fail to generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased proxy for underlying affect. Brain signals provide more direct access to emotional states.

Method: Cross-modal distillation framework with teacher trained on EEG topographic maps producing frozen 5x5 V/A prototype grid. Student trained with CE/KD loss plus two regularizers: Proto-KD (cosine alignment to prototypes) and D-Geo (depression-inspired geometric prior shaping embedding space).

Result: Method improves robustness in both within-domain (FERPlus validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini, CK+), with consistent gains attributed to prototypes and D-Geo. 5x5 grid favored over denser grids for stability.

Conclusion: Simple, deployable approach that improves FER robustness without architectural complexity, transferring brain-informed priors to image-only models without requiring EEG signals during deployment.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to
generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased
proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal
distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only
FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a
depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG
topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a
consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face
pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student
(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two
lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the
static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with
affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like
contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus
validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),
reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced
accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent
gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.
The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural
complexity.

*Bo Cao,Fan Yu,Mengmeng Feng,SenHao Zhang,Xin Meng,Yue Zhang,Zhen Qian,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMD method uses variation inference and multimodal knowledge distillation to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge for automated carotid plaque vulnerability diagnosis from 3D MRI images and radiology reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing carotid plaque vulnerability from 3D MRI images is challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. Clinical practice uses multimodal approaches combining various imaging modalities and domain expertise, suggesting the need for multimodal diagnostic networks.

Method: Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD) strategy that harnesses cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports to enhance diagnostic accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images.

Result: Conducted in-depth experiments on an in-house dataset and verified the effectiveness of the proposed VMD strategy.

Conclusion: The VMD method provides an effective approach to automate carotid plaque vulnerability diagnosis by leveraging radiologists' domain knowledge through multimodal learning and knowledge distillation techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its
ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different
modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly
from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and
conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess
patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various
imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the
creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an
effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the
diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and
Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing
cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology
reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's
accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on
the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD
strategy we proposed.

*Xue Zhang,Bingshuo Hu,Gene Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to image interpolation using graph-based initialization and lightweight neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer parameters than conventional DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DNNs initialize parameters randomly and optimize via SGD, which risks poor local minima. The authors aim to develop a more reliable initialization method and efficient architecture for image interpolation.

Method: Leverage a theorem mapping linear interpolators to directed graph filters. Initialize graph adjacency matrix from known interpolator, then learn perturbation matrices from data. Implement restoration via unrolled Douglas-Rachford iterations into an interpretable neural network.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation performance while drastically reducing the number of network parameters compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based initialization and lightweight interpretable neural network architecture provides superior image interpolation results with significantly reduced parameter count, avoiding the pitfalls of random initialization and SGD optimization.

Abstract: Conventional deep neural nets (DNNs) initialize network parameters at random
and then optimize each one via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), resulting in
substantial risk of poor-performing local minima.Focusing on the image
interpolation problem and leveraging a recent theorem that maps a
(pseudo-)linear interpolator {\Theta} to a directed graph filter that is a
solution to a MAP problem regularized with a graph shift variation (GSV) prior,
we first initialize a directed graph adjacency matrix A based on a known
interpolator {\Theta}, establishing a baseline performance.Then, towards
further gain, we learn perturbation matrices P and P(2) from data to augment A,
whose restoration effects are implemented via Douglas-Rachford (DR) iterations,
which we unroll into a lightweight interpretable neural net.Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation results, while
drastically reducing network parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphere-GAN is a novel saliency detection model for 360° videos that uses a Generative Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of immersive applications requires new approaches for processing 360° content, but existing saliency estimation methods are primarily designed for 2D content, creating a gap for effective 360° video saliency detection.

Method: The authors introduce Sphere-GAN, which leverages a Generative Adversarial Network architecture with spherical convolutions specifically designed for 360° video content.

Result: Extensive experiments on a public 360° video saliency dataset show that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately predicting saliency maps.

Conclusion: Sphere-GAN provides an effective solution for 360° video saliency detection, demonstrating the value of specialized spherical convolutions and GAN architecture for immersive content analysis.

Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research
community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and
optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a
powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and,
consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has
been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed
for 360{\deg} saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN,
a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative
Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were
conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results
demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately
predicting saliency maps.

*Debopom Sutradhar,Arefin Ittesafun Abian,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Reem E. Mohamed,Sheikh Izzal Azid,Sami Azam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CLAIRE - a dual encoder architecture with cross-modality attention fusion for land cover classification using optical and SAR imagery, addressing class imbalance with RIFT loss function and adding interpretability through SLM-generated explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate land cover classification is crucial for environmental monitoring but remains challenging due to landscape complexity, visual similarity between classes, and significant class imbalance in datasets.

Method: Dual encoder architecture independently extracts features from optical and SAR imagery, fused using cross-modality attention module (CLAIRE). Uses hybrid RIFT loss (Weighted Focal + Tversky) to handle class imbalance. Includes SLM-generated metric-driven reasoning for interpretability.

Result: Achieves competitive performance: 56.02% mIoU and 84.56% OA on WHU-OPT-SAR; 59.89% mIoU and 73.92% OA on OpenEarthMap-SAR; 86.86% mIoU and 94.58% OA on cloud-obstructed PIE-RGB-SAR dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed CLAIRE framework effectively addresses land cover classification challenges through multi-modal fusion, imbalance-aware loss functions, and enhanced interpretability, demonstrating strong performance and robustness across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in
environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it
remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual
similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the
available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder
architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using
a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover
segmentation with Attention and Imbalance-aware Reasoning-Enhanced Explanations
(CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial and textural
features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and diverse land
cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted
Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address
class imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented
categories. Our model achieves competitive performance across multiple
benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and Overall
Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong generalization with
a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR dataset; and
remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving an mIoU of
86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we introduce
a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model (Phi-3),
which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model
predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

*Wenyan Li,Raphael Tang,Chengzu Li,Caiqi Zhang,Ivan Vulić,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs suffer from significant information loss when projecting visual features into language space, with 40-60% distortion in nearest neighbors and degraded retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and analyze the information loss that occurs when vision encoders project visual representations into language model embedding space through connector components.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Analyze k-nearest neighbor relationships before/after projection to measure semantic preservation, 2) Reconstruct visual embeddings from projected representations to localize patch-level information loss.

Result: Connectors substantially distort local geometry (40-60% divergence in nearest neighbors), correlating with retrieval degradation. Patch-level reconstruction shows high loss areas predict model failures in visual QA tasks.

Conclusion: The projection step in VLMs causes significant information loss that impacts model performance, with patch-level analysis providing interpretable insights for model behavior and failure cases.

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual
representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\%
post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The
patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model
behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of
high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

TL;DR: LiDARCrafter is a unified framework that converts free-form language into editable 4D LiDAR sequences using scene graphs and diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for accurate 3D perception, and extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation.

Method: The framework parses language instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, uses a tri-branch diffusion model for object layouts/trajectories/shapes, employs range-image diffusion for initial scan generation, and an autoregressive module for temporal sequence extension with object-level editing capabilities.

Result: On nuScenes dataset, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency, and includes EvalSuite benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter provides a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data augmentation, successfully addressing the challenges of 4D LiDAR generation with strong performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data
synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for
accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces
challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present
LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into
editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene
graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts,
trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial
scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent
sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing,
such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide
EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On
nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data

TL;DR: SCORE is a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models that formulates erasure as an adversarial independence problem, providing theoretical guarantees and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.5% in erasure efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models pose increasing risks in privacy, fairness, and security, creating demand for methods to erase sensitive or harmful concepts while preserving overall generative capabilities.

Method: SCORE minimizes mutual information between target concepts and generated outputs using adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning to achieve provable concept erasure.

Result: SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods (EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, UCE) across four benchmarks, achieving up to 12.5% higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality.

Conclusion: SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models by providing theoretical guarantees and superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but
pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing
demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW
content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while
preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE}
(Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust
concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an
\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the
model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike
prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a
target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We
provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper
bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW
removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,
MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy
while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating
adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven
fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in
diffusion models.

TL;DR: RAM++ is a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration that integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve robust restoration across various degradation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios where degradations are strongly coupled with image structures, and to mitigate challenges like unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM) for pretraining with pixel-level masks on semantically rich regions, 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC) for selective fine-tuning to bridge integrity gaps, and 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR) leveraging DINOv2's representations for semantically coherent restoration.

Result: RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates semantic understanding with texture generation for content-oriented robust image restoration, overcoming limitations of traditional degradation-focused approaches.

Abstract: This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++),
a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates
high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve
content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing
degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly
coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as
unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak
generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive
Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level
masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the
network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various
degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning
strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the
integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while
retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy
that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant
representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful
and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves
robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,
extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS) is underexplored due to lack of standardized benchmarks and domain gap between natural and remote sensing images.

Method: Proposed RSKT-Seg framework with three components: Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation module, Efficient Cost Map Fusion transformer, and Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer module for domain adaptation.

Result: RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

Conclusion: The proposed RSKT-Seg framework effectively addresses the domain gap in remote sensing segmentation and sets a new state-of-the-art for open-vocabulary segmentation in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task
that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS)
domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation
benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these
gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench})
based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation
across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several
representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly
applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose
\textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for
remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a
Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures
rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities
across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion)
transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a
lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing
Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and
facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines
by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through
efficient aggregation. Our code is

*Pu Jian,Junhong Wu,Wei Sun,Chen Wang,Shuo Ren,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reflection-V enhances visual reasoning in VLMs by improving visual reflection through specialized data construction and reinforcement learning rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models show limited visual reflection - their attention to visual information decreases with longer responses, hindering effective visual reasoning.

Method: Uses vision-centered reasoning data construction via agent interaction between VLMs and reasoning LLMs for cold-start learning, plus visual attention-based reward model during RL training.

Result: Significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, with stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during reasoning.

Conclusion: Reflection-V effectively enhances visual reflection capabilities in vision-language models, enabling better visual reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

*Zirui Zheng,Takashi Isobe,Tong Shen,Xu Jia,Jianbin Zhao,Xiaomin Li,Mengmeng Ge,Baolu Li,Qinghe Wang,Dong Li,Dong Zhou,Yunzhi Zhuge,Huchuan Lu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARLI is a novel framework for layout-to-image generation that integrates structured masking in attention computation to effectively incorporate spatial layout constraints into autoregressive image generation while preventing feature entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models show success in image generation but struggle with layout-conditioned generation due to sparse layout conditions and risk of feature entanglement between different regions and their descriptions.

Method: Uses structured masking strategy in attention computation to control interactions among global prompt, layout, and image tokens. Incorporates Group Relative Policy Optimization with layout reward functions for post-training.

Result: Achieves seamless integration of layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising generation quality. Maintains superior layout-aware control while preserving structural simplicity and generation efficiency.

Conclusion: SMARLI successfully addresses layout-conditioned generation challenges in AR models through structured masking and optimization techniques, enabling effective layout control while maintaining generation quality and efficiency.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in
image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains
challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of
feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based
Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that
effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image
generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed
structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the
interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design
prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while
enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation
process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we
incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training
scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR
models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly
integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising
generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining
the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

TL;DR: A modular computer vision pipeline using state-of-the-art models for automated animal behavior analysis in group housing, achieving 94.2% accuracy and significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual observation methods for animal behavior analysis are time-consuming, subjective, and lack scalability, especially in agricultural settings where understanding animal welfare and productivity is crucial.

Method: Combines zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking and segmentation, and vision transformers for feature extraction in a modular pipeline designed to handle challenges like animal occlusions in group housing environments.

Result: Achieved 94.2% overall accuracy (21.2% improvement over existing methods), 93.3% identity preservation score, and 89.3% object detection precision on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset.

Abstract: Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal
welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However,
traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and
limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages
open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal
behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines
state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking
and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for
robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal
occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig
monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset
for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall
accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing
methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%
identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular
design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further
validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision
pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous
analysis.

### [213] [AvatarSync: Rethinking Talking-Head Animation through Autoregressive Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12052)
*Yuchen Deng,Xiuyang Wu,Hai-Tao Zheng,Suiyang Zhang,Yi He,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarSync is an autoregressive framework that generates realistic talking-head animations from a single image using text/audio input, addressing flicker and identity drift issues through a two-stage phoneme-based approach with improved temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN and diffusion-based talking-head animation methods suffer from inter-frame flicker, identity drift, and slow inference, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Two-stage autoregressive framework: 1) Facial Keyframe Generation using phoneme representations with Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, 2) Inter-frame interpolation with timestamp-aware adaptive strategy using selective state space model for bidirectional context reasoning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: AvatarSync provides a scalable and controllable solution for realistic talking-head animation with improved performance over current approaches.

Abstract: Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,
identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video
generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address
this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme
representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head
animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.
In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling
semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and
Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on
phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping
from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to
anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized
Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second
stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual
smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a
selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context
reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce
latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that
AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual
fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a
scalable and controllable solution.

### [214] [Robust Fetal Pose Estimation across Gestational Ages via Cross-Population Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12062)
*Sebastian Diaz,Benjamin Billot,Neel Dey,Molin Zhang,Esra Abaci Turk,P. Ellen Grant,Polina Golland,Elfar Adalsteinsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-population data augmentation framework that enables fetal pose estimation models to generalize to younger gestational ages using only older GA annotated data, improving reliability across gestation periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fetal motion tracking methods fail to generalize to early gestational ages due to anatomical changes and lack of annotated early GA data, limiting early clinical detection capabilities.

Method: Developed a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates early GA intrauterine environments and fetal positioning using only annotated images from older GA cohorts.

Result: Cross-population augmentation yielded reduced variability and significant improvements in pose estimation accuracy across both older GA and challenging early GA cases.

Conclusion: The framework enables more reliable fetal pose estimation across gestation, potentially facilitating early clinical detection and intervention in 4D fetal imaging settings.

Abstract: Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and
intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly
at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by
predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI)
time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks
enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these
methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently
fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both
mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data
augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly
generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from
older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation
strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal
positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population
augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across
both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose
estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical
detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is

### [215] [End-to-End Learning of Multi-Organ Implicit Surfaces from 3D Medical Imaging Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12068)
*Farahdiba Zarin,Nicolas Padoy,Jérémy Dana,Vinkle Srivastav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImplMORe is an end-to-end deep learning method using implicit surface representations for high-resolution multi-organ reconstruction from 3D medical images, outperforming discrete explicit approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained surface reconstruction from 3D medical imaging provides advanced diagnostic support but is limited by resolution constraints and computational demands. While implicit representations help in general computer vision, they cannot be directly applied to medical images due to architectural and data-related differences.

Method: ImplMORe uses a 3D CNN encoder to incorporate local features and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn features in the continuous domain using occupancy functions. It's applied for single and multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset.

Result: The approach outperforms discrete explicit representation-based surface reconstruction methods by leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, providing fine-grained surface details at resolutions higher than the input image.

Conclusion: ImplMORe successfully addresses the limitations of traditional methods for medical image reconstruction by using implicit surface representations, enabling higher-resolution organ surface reconstruction with better detail preservation.

Abstract: The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Mamba2 is a new neural network that combines Mamba2 state space models with U-Net for efficient multi-anatomy CBCT dental segmentation, achieving top performance in the ToothFairy3 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of dental anatomies in CBCT is critical for clinical applications but remains time-consuming and challenging, requiring more efficient and effective solutions.

Method: Integrates Mamba2 state space models into U-Net architecture, adds interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, uses self-supervised pre-training, and incorporates dental domain knowledge.

Result: Achieved mean Dice of 0.792 and HD95 of 93.19 in Task 1, and mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 in Task 2, securing top 3 places in both tasks of ToothFairy3 challenge.

Conclusion: U-Mamba2 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency for dental CBCT segmentation, providing a strong solution that balances performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new
neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the
context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state
space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural
constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In
addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks,
pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental
domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental
anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent
tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top
3 places in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2
achieved a mean Dice of 0.792, HD95 of 93.19 with the held-out test data, with
an average inference time of XX (TBC during the ODIN workshop). In Task 2,
U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 with the held-out

*Xiaodong Wang,Ping Wang,Zijun He,Mengjie Qin,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel trajectory-controllable unfolding framework for coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging that ensures smooth, continuous optimization paths from noisy estimates to high-quality hyperspectral reconstructions, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding networks for CASSI reconstruction suffer from uncontrollable trajectories causing abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages, limiting reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes a trajectory-controllable unfolding framework inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, with an efficient spatial-spectral Transformer and frequency-domain fusion module for feature consistency.

Result: Achieves better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art approaches on both simulation and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the trajectory control problem in CASSI reconstruction, delivering superior performance through smooth optimization paths and efficient spatial-spectral processing.

Abstract: Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral
image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly
challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs),
empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have
achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing
unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories,
leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.
Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel
trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous
optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient
spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along
with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency.
Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TetHeart is an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 4D cardiac motion from both complete CMR stacks and sparse intra-procedural slices using deep deformable tetrahedra representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion reconstruction methods require complete CMR stacks, limiting their utility in intra-procedural scenarios where only sparse slice observations are available.

Method: Uses deep deformable tetrahedra (explicit-implicit hybrid representation) with attentive slice-adaptive 2D-3D feature assembly and two-stage weakly supervised motion learning requiring only ED/ES annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization on three large public datasets and external evaluation on private interventional datasets.

Conclusion: TetHeart enables accurate 4D heart mesh reconstruction from both full-stack and sparse-slice scenarios, making it suitable for both pre-procedural and intra-procedural clinical applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for
diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR
stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural
scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart,
the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh
recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural
sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an
explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a
coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from
high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed,
patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices
are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate
several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D
feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers
of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from
full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under
extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme
requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on
three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional
private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and
intra-procedural settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-SAM2 repurposes SAM2's video capabilities for few-shot segmentation using LoRA adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art results with high computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation methods require extensive training on large datasets. SAM2 offers strong zero-shot segmentation capabilities but needs adaptation for diverse few-shot scenarios beyond temporally connected video frames.

Method: Repurpose SAM2's video segmentation modules for few-shot learning, apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to handle diverse images, and meta-train only a small number of parameters while leveraging SAM2's base capabilities.

Result: Achieves remarkable results on PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and FSS-1000 datasets with excellent computational efficiency during inference. Supports any K-shot configuration.

Conclusion: FS-SAM2 effectively adapts SAM2 for few-shot segmentation through minimal parameter tuning, demonstrating strong performance and efficiency while leveraging foundational model capabilities.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The
goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a
few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by
training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with
these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and
video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot
segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities
are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images
typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames
used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of
parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from
its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot
configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and
FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent
computational efficiency during inference. Code is available at

*Ing. Ondrej Valach,Ing. Ivan Gruber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RailSafeNet is a real-time AI framework that uses monocular video to detect track intrusions and assess collision risks by combining semantic segmentation, object detection, and rule-based distance assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tram-human interaction safety is critical as trams operate in dense urban areas where collisions can cause serious injuries or fatalities. Current systems need better real-time risk assessment capabilities.

Method: The framework fuses semantic segmentation (SegFormer B3 for rail detection), object detection (YOLOv8 for object localization), and a rule-based Distance Assessor that compares projected distances with standard 1435mm rail gauge to classify risk levels.

Result: Achieved 65% IoU for rail segmentation and 75.6% mAP for object detection on the RailSem19 dataset. The system provides accurate, real-time scene understanding with minimal annotation requirements.

Conclusion: RailSafeNet delivers effective real-time intrusion detection and risk classification that can warn tram drivers before dangerous situations escalate, improving overall tram safety in urban environments.

Abstract: Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams
frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from
minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the
perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians,
drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a
real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a
rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only
monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and
classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm
rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a
class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),
while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated
at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore
delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers
before dangerous situations escalate. Code available at

*Nojod M. Alotaibi,Areej M. Alhothali,Manar S. Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified pipeline combining Vision Transformers and Graph Neural Networks for automated detection of major depressive disorder from structural MRI data, achieving 78.98% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MDD detection methods using sMRI and deep learning are limited by voxel-level features or predefined brain atlases, failing to capture complex brain patterns effectively.

Method: Developed a pipeline using ViTs to extract 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and GNN for classification. Two region definition strategies: atlas-based (predefined brain atlases) and cube-based (ViTs trained on 3D patches). Cosine similarity graphs model interregional relationships for GNN classification.

Result: Achieved 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score using stratified 10-fold cross-validation on REST-meta-MDD dataset. Atlas-based models outperformed cube-based approach.

Conclusion: The proposed unified pipeline effectively detects MDD from sMRI data. Atlas-based approach with domain-specific anatomical priors is superior to cube-based method for MDD detection.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that
negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.
Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods
employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations
built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex
brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and
Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for
defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and
functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are
trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.
Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional
relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were
conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained
78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and
78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the
cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific
anatomical priors for MDD detection.

Motivation: To advance streaming video understanding beyond simple action classification by enabling hierarchical temporal analysis and free-form description generation, addressing the scarcity of datasets with fine-grained temporal annotations.

Method: Proposes OpenHOUSE system with specialized streaming module for accurate action boundary detection, leverages LLMs to group atomic actions into higher-level events and enrich existing datasets.

Result: The system nearly doubles the performance of direct extensions of existing methods for detecting boundaries between closely adjacent actions.

Conclusion: OpenHOUSE represents a key step toward integrating powerful generative models for streaming action perception, enabling hierarchical online video understanding with free-form descriptions.

Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines
online temporal action localization with free-form description generation.
Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal
annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into
higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE
(Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends
streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a
specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely
adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of
existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the
integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key
step in that direction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on most multi-anatomy tasks and remains competitive on chest-specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: Anatomical diversity and supervision are critical for building robust, general-purpose medical vision models, enabling scalable and adaptable AI systems in radiology.

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a ubiquitous in radiology, yet most existing AI foundation

*M. Bolhassani,B. Veasey,E. Daugherty,S. Keltner,N. Kumar,N. Dunlap,A. Amini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning for vision models (DinoV2/SwinV2) achieves comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning for RILI diagnosis from CT scans, with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate efficient fine-tuning methods for large vision models in medical imaging applications, specifically for diagnosing Radiation-Induced Lung Injury from CT scans after SBRT treatment.

Method: Compared LoRA adaptation with traditional full fine-tuning and inference-only approaches using DinoV2 and SwinV2 models. Used cropped CT images (50mm³ and 75mm³) centered at treatment isocenter, with different adaptation techniques for 3D data.

Result: LoRA achieved comparable or superior performance to traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: LoRA is an efficient and effective fine-tuning approach for large vision models in medical imaging tasks, offering robust performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for
fine-tuning large Vision Models, DinoV2 and SwinV2, to diagnose
Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) from X-ray CT scans following Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of
this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and
inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3
and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different
adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to
determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental
results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to
traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and
training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

### [225] [HoloGarment: 360° Novel View Synthesis of In-the-Wild Garments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12187)
*Johanna Karras,Yingwei Li,Yasamin Jafarian,Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloGarment enables 360° novel view synthesis of real-world garments from 1-3 images or videos by bridging synthetic-real domain gap with implicit training and garment atlas representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on synthetic 3D training data that doesn't generalize well to real-world clothing due to occlusions, complex poses, and deformations in natural settings.

Method: Uses novel implicit training paradigm combining large-scale real video data with small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize shared garment embedding space. Creates garment "atlas" representation that captures geometry and texture across viewpoints independent of body pose.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis of in-the-wild garments, robustly handling wrinkling, pose variation, occlusion while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, and accurate geometry.

Conclusion: HoloGarment successfully bridges the synthetic-real domain gap for garment NVS, enabling high-quality 360° view generation from limited real-world inputs through shared embedding space and atlas representation.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due
significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior
methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and
static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this
paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3
images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates
360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to
bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit
training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and
small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.
During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic
video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas"
representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world
video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all
viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that
HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild
garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles
challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and
occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture
details, and accurate geometry. Visit our project page for additional results:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning with domain-adaptive pretraining significantly improves action recognition for primate behavior analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art models by over 6% without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision for animal behavior research faces high labeling costs as a bottleneck, especially with video camera traps generating large-scale data. There's a need for data-efficient learning approaches to support ecology, cognition research, and conservation efforts.

Method: Utilized self-supervised learning with a pretrained V-JEPA model and applied domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP) - continuing pretraining with in-domain primate behavior data without requiring labeled samples.

Result: Outperformed published state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1% accuracy on PanAf dataset and 6.3% mAP on ChimpACT dataset. Most performance gains came from the domain-adaptive pretraining component.

Conclusion: The method shows great potential for improving animal behavior recognition as DAP doesn't require labeled samples, making it highly scalable for large-scale wildlife monitoring and conservation applications.

Abstract: Computer vision for animal behavior offers promising tools to aid research in
ecology, cognition, and to support conservation efforts. Video camera traps
allow for large-scale data collection, but high labeling costs remain a
bottleneck to creating large-scale datasets. We thus need data-efficient
learning approaches. In this work, we show that we can utilize self-supervised
learning to considerably improve action recognition on primate behavior. On two
datasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published
state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt.
mAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and
applying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining
with in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the
DAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of
animal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples. Code is available at

TL;DR: OmniWorld is a large-scale multi-domain dataset for 4D world modeling that addresses data limitations in dynamic complexity and multi-modal coverage, enabling better 4D reconstruction and video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D world modeling is constrained by limited high-quality data that lacks dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations needed for tasks like 4D reconstruction and future prediction.

Method: Introduces OmniWorld dataset combining newly collected OmniWorld-Game data with curated public datasets, providing richer modality coverage, larger scale, and realistic dynamic interactions across diverse domains.

Result: Establishes a benchmark revealing limitations of current SOTA methods, and shows that fine-tuning existing approaches on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains in 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: OmniWorld serves as a powerful resource and catalyst for developing general-purpose 4D world models, advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.

Abstract: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry
and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning.
However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally
constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and
benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and
spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric
reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To
address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld
consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public
datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,
OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more
realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a
challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning
existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains
across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating
OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision
OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D
world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the
physical world.

### [229] [LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers via Explicit Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12203)
*Zixin Yin,Xili Dai,Duomin Wang,Xianfang Zeng,Lionel M. Ni,Gang Yu,Heung-Yeung Shum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LazyDrag is a novel drag-based image editing method that eliminates implicit point matching, enabling stable full-strength inversion without test-time optimization, achieving superior drag accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based editing methods rely on implicit point matching via attention, which compromises inversion strength and requires costly test-time optimization, limiting generative capabilities of diffusion models.

Method: Generates explicit correspondence maps from user drag inputs to boost attention control, enabling stable full-strength inversion process without test-time optimization.

Result: Outperforms baselines on DragBench in drag accuracy and perceptual quality, validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. Enables complex edits like opening mouths, generating new objects, and context-aware changes.

Conclusion: LazyDrag establishes new state-of-the-art performance and paves a new way for editing paradigms by unifying precise geometric control with text guidance.

Abstract: The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core
bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on
weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This
compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,
suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,
we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for
Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on
implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit
correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the
attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable
full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing
task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability
of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with
text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:
opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects
like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes
like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round
workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the
DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual
quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to
editing paradigms.

TL;DR: Audio-visual pipeline for animated character recognition using online-sourced character banks with visual and voice samples, enabling accessibility applications like audio description and character-aware subtitling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animated characters pose challenges for conventional recognition systems due to extreme diversity in appearance, motion, and deformation, requiring new approaches for character-centric understanding.

Method: Automatic construction of audio-visual character bank from online sources containing visual exemplars and voice samples, enabling multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.

Result: Significant improvements in accessibility and narrative comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches, with new CMD-AM dataset of 75 annotated animated movies.

Conclusion: The audio-visual pipeline enables robust animated character recognition and supports downstream accessibility applications, advancing character-centric understanding of animated movies.

Abstract: Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and
imaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing
recognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by
conventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme
diversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we
propose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated
character recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of
animated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an
audio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual
exemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent
multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.
Building on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream
applications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired
audiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support
research in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated
movies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline
demonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative
comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.

Conclusion: The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions, advancing AI capabilities in professional financial reasoning.

Abstract: Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial
analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where
markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack
explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis
into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in
step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive
financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a
financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for
comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and
volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading
principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a
three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample
corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data
sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates
improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source
and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The
system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamNav is a zero-shot vision-and-language navigation method that addresses limitations of existing approaches by using viewpoint alignment, trajectory-level planning, and proactive imagination to achieve state-of-the-art performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot VLN methods are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning due to their reliance on costly perception, passive scene understanding, and point-level control choices.

Method: DreamNav introduces three key components: (1) EgoView Corrector for viewpoint alignment and egocentric perception stabilization, (2) Trajectory Predictor for global trajectory-level planning aligned with instruction semantics, and (3) Imagination Predictor for anticipatory and long-horizon planning with proactive thinking capability.

Result: DreamNav achieves new zero-shot state-of-the-art performance on VLN-CE and real-world tests, outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline by up to 7.49% in SR and 18.15% in SPL metrics.

Conclusion: DreamNav is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs, successfully addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a
core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation
models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and
action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However,
existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene
understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are
expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in
planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the
following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector
aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of
point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level
planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable
anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to
endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world
tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the
strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and
18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first
zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination
while using only egocentric inputs.

Motivation: Existing embodied navigation approaches suffer from incoherent reasoning traces that hinder generalization and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation.

Method: Constructed Nav-CoT-110K dataset for cold-start initialization, designed GRPO-based reinforcement learning with format, understanding, and navigation rewards, and introduced Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm decoupling semantic reasoning from reactive control.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance on embodied AI benchmarks, validated by real-world deployment on mobile robots under limited resources.

Conclusion: Nav-R1 provides an effective framework for unified reasoning in embodied environments, demonstrating robust performance through structured reasoning initialization, multi-reward RL training, and decoupled reasoning-control architecture.

Abstract: Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and
action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches
often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder
generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing
long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time
navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied
foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first
construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought
(CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with
structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based
reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format,
understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic
grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow
reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency
reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations
on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms
strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation
performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its
robustness under limited onboard resources. Code:

TL;DR: ManiVID-3D is a 3D RL architecture for robotic manipulation that learns view-invariant representations through self-supervised disentangled feature learning, achieving 44.7% higher success rates than SOTA methods with 80% fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL policies often fail when camera viewpoints change in real-world manipulation tasks, as existing methods rely on precise calibration or struggle with large perspective changes.

Method: Proposes ViewNet module for automatic point cloud alignment without extrinsic calibration, plus GPU-accelerated batch rendering (5000+ fps) for large-scale 3D visual RL training.

Result: Achieves 44.7% higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations, demonstrates robustness to severe perspective changes and strong sim-to-real performance.

Conclusion: Learning geometrically consistent representations enables scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured environments with view-invariant performance.

Abstract: Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world
manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained
from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an
unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to
manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration
or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we
propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic
manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through
self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates
ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point
cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate
system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an
efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over
5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at
unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world
tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than
state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer
parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong
sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically
consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured
environments. Our project website can be found in

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for vision-language-action models that preserves pretrained features while adapting for robot manipulation through dual encoders, string-based action tokenization, and co-training with vision-language datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct fine-tuning of vision-language models on robot data often disrupts pretrained representations and limits generalization, so there's a need to better preserve these features while adapting them for robotic tasks.

Method: Three key components: (1) dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder and one trainable encoder, (2) string-based action tokenizer that converts continuous actions to character sequences, and (3) co-training strategy combining robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets focusing on spatial reasoning.

Result: The method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baseline approaches in both simulation and real robot evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively preserves pretrained vision-language features while adapting them for robot manipulation, demonstrating superior generalization and performance across diverse tasks and environments.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models
(VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build
generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct
fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits
generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained
features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces
three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to
retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a
string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character
sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training
strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets
emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on
real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations,
generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success
compared to baselines.

*Haisheng Wang,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) - a parallel, urgency-aware framework for handling multiple asynchronous questions in 3D environments, outperforming sequential baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical EQA only handles single questions, but real deployments require handling multiple questions with different urgencies arriving asynchronously.

Method: Proposed ParaEQsA framework with group memory module to reduce redundant exploration and priority-planning module for dynamic question scheduling. Created PAEQs benchmark with 40 scenes and 200 questions featuring urgency labels.

Result: ParaEQsA consistently outperforms sequential baselines, reducing exploration and delay. Achieves better performance measured by DAR and NUWL metrics.

Conclusion: Urgency-aware parallel scheduling is crucial for making embodied agents responsive and efficient under realistic multi-question workloads.

Abstract: This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem,
introduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the
problem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as
answering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real
deployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive
asynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as
Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for
parallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group
memory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a
priority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this
setting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)
benchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in
total), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We
further propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and
Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency
and responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong
sequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing
exploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative
contributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation,
and dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results
demonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied
agents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.

TL;DR: KORR framework combines Koopman operator theory with residual policy learning to enable globally informed action corrections for improved imitation learning in long-horizon robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing residual policy learning approaches focus on local corrections without global state understanding, limiting robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios.

Method: Leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear time-invariant structure in latent space, enabling reliable state transitions and conditioning residual corrections on Koopman-predicted latent states.

Result: Demonstrates consistent gains in performance, robustness, and generalization on long-horizon robotic furniture assembly tasks under various perturbations compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Koopman-based modeling effectively bridges modern learning methods with classical control theory, providing globally informed and stable action refinement for imitation learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory. For more details, please

mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation
pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and
generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent
performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it
achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505
+/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary
leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/-
0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable
solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By
addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the

*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FireGNN integrates trainable fuzzy rules into Graph Neural Networks for medical image classification, providing both high performance and interpretable rule-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image classification requires both predictive performance and interpretability for clinical trust. Standard GNNs operate as black boxes, limiting transparency in clinical settings.

Method: Integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs using topological descriptors (node degree, clustering coefficient, label agreement) with learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters. Also explores auxiliary self-supervised tasks like homophily prediction and similarity entropy.

Result: Achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and MorphoMNIST dataset while generating interpretable rule-based explanations.

Conclusion: First integration of trainable fuzzy rules within GNNs, providing both performance and interpretability for medical image classification.

Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance
but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures
within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting
transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we
present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that
integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification.
These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering
coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness
parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore
auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity
entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning.
Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST
benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating
interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first
integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

*Aoife McDonald-Bowyer,Anjana Wijekoon,Ryan Laurance Love,Katie Allan,Scott Colvin,Aleksandra Gentry-Maharaj,Adeola Olaitan,Danail Stoyanov,Agostino Stilli,Sophia Bano*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning methods for real-time cervical os segmentation in transvaginal endoscopic images, with EndoViT/DPT vision transformer achieving best performance for speculum-free cervical screening devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer is preventable but screening barriers persist. Speculum-free devices with imaging and sampling could improve access, especially in low-resource settings, but require reliable visual guidance for the cervical os.

Method: Compared five encoder-decoder architectures using 913 frames from 200 cases in IARC Cervical Image Dataset. Used IoU, DICE, detection rate, and distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. External validation with phantom data.

Result: EndoViT/DPT (vision transformer pre-trained on surgical video) achieved highest DICE (0.50 ± 0.31) and detection rate (0.87 ± 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches. Demonstrated robust segmentation at 21.5 FPS supporting real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for integrating automated os recognition into speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both high- and low-resource contexts.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is highly preventable, yet persistent barriers to screening
limit progress toward elimination goals. Speculum-free devices that integrate
imaging and sampling could improve access, particularly in low-resource
settings, but require reliable visual guidance. This study evaluates deep
learning methods for real-time segmentation of the cervical os in transvaginal
endoscopic images. Five encoder-decoder architectures were compared using 913
frames from 200 cases in the IARC Cervical Image Dataset, annotated by
gynaecologists. Performance was assessed using IoU, DICE, detection rate, and
distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. EndoViT/DPT, a vision
transformer pre-trained on surgical video, achieved the highest DICE (0.50 \pm
0.31) and detection rate (0.87 \pm 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches.
External validation with phantom data demonstrated robust segmentation under
variable conditions at 21.5 FPS, supporting real-time feasibility. These
results establish a foundation for integrating automated os recognition into
speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both
high- and low-resource contexts.

*Jin Yang,Daniel S. Marcus,Aristeidis Sotiras*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes ASFDA method for efficient adaptation of medical vision foundation models using active learning to select informative target domain samples without source data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VFMs lack efficient adaptation methods for optimal performance on target domains, especially for segmentation tasks with minimal sample selection budget.

Method: Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation with novel AL method using DKD and ASD query metrics, plus selective semi-supervised fine-tuning with reliable unqueried samples.

Result: Enables efficient adaptation of Med-VFMs to target domains by selecting source-dissimilar, diverse, and anatomically challenging samples for maximal performance.

Conclusion: ASFDA provides an effective framework for domain adaptation of medical vision foundation models with minimal annotation budget while maintaining source-free constraints.

Abstract: Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of
interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised
pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on
adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from
target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks
works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal
performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to
design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative
samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve
this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to
efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image
segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select
the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs
without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their
performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an
Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target
domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD)
and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the
source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the
knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and
semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate
the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive
entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method
employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and
efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from
unqueried ones.

### [242] [Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10804)
*Mohammadreza Narimani,Alireza Pourreza,Ali Moghimi,Parastoo Farajpoor,Hamid Jafarbiglu,Mohsen Mesgaran*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Satellite-based time-series analysis using Sentinel-2 imagery and LSTM networks can detect broomrape-infested tomato fields with 87% accuracy by monitoring chlorophyll-related vegetation indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Branched broomrape causes up to 80% yield loss in tomato production and is difficult to detect early due to its subterranean lifecycle and long-lived seeds, requiring scalable detection methods.

Method: Used Sentinel-2 imagery with 12 spectral bands, computed 20 vegetation indices, derived 5 plant traits via neural network, and trained LSTM on 18,874 pixels across 48 time points aligned with growing degree days.

Result: Model achieved 87% test accuracy with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and chlorophyll red-edge index were most informative features.

Conclusion: Satellite-driven time-series modeling shows promise for scalable detection of parasitic stress in agriculture, particularly through monitoring chlorophyll-related physiological changes.

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient
parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from
the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean
life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant,
viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an
end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to
identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest
were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10
percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and
sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and
derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy
Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation,
and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with
ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content
delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using
growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day
time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent
test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation
feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a
chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the
physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of
satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic
stress in tomato farms.

treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and
their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation,
we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework

*Marcus Lin,Jennifer Lai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AI-powered digital smile design system that automates the process using facial feature extraction and image generation, enabling both experienced and inexperienced dentists to create aesthetically pleasing smiles while addressing limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional smile design relies heavily on dentist expertise using plaster models and hand drawings, leading to subjective outcomes. Digital technology offers improvements but current AI systems are susceptible to practitioner bias and training data limitations, creating suboptimal results for individual patients.

Method: Comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies with two main modules: Facial Feature Extraction Module and Image Generation Module. The system automates the smile design process to serve diverse practitioner and patient needs.

Result: The system enables both experienced and inexperienced dentists to generate pleasing aesthetic outcomes with ease. It provides a foundation for future optimization through user data incorporation and testing of virtual/augmented reality for real-time previewing.

Conclusion: This AI-integrated approach represents a significant advancement over traditional smile design methods, offering automated, personalized solutions while creating opportunities for aesthetic preference analysis and enhanced knowledge in dental practice.

Abstract: A healthy smile plays a significant role in functional as well as esthetic
considerations, improving confidence. It is difficult for dental professionals
to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements.
Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used
plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for
patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows
photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication
among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and
big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of
personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however,
susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be
suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a
comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to
automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced
dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial
Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse
practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future
research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality
for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic
preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental
practice.

### [245] [Length-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Text-Speech Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11084)
*Hyeongju Kim,Juheon Lee,Jinhyeok Yang,Jacob Morton*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: LARoPE is an improved rotary position embedding method that uses length-normalized relative distances instead of absolute indices, achieving better text-speech alignment and TTS quality than standard RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RoPE in TTS systems relies on absolute position indices, which may not handle varying utterance lengths and text-speech alignment optimally.

Method: LARoPE extends RoPE by computing relative distances between query and key positions using length-normalized indices rather than absolute indices.

Result: LARoPE outperforms RoPE with faster convergence, better alignment, higher TTS quality, resilience to duration variations, and stable performance for long speech (up to 30s). Achieves SOTA word error rate on zero-shot TTS benchmark.

Conclusion: LARoPE is a simple but effective improvement over RoPE that significantly enhances text-speech alignment and TTS performance across various conditions.

Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer
architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment.
Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to
encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work,
we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of
RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute
indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions
using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE
consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate
text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE
demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and
maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds,
whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a
state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.

### [246] [Spectral Bottleneck in Deep Neural Networks: Noise is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09719)
*Hemanth Chandravamsi,Dhanush V. Shenoy,Itay Zinn,Shimon Pisnoy,Steven H. Frankel*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: WINNER - weight initialization with noise addresses spectral bottleneck in neural networks by adaptively perturbing weights based on target signal's spectral centroid, enabling better fitting of high-frequency signals and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks suffer from spectral learning bias where they learn low-frequency components first, creating a bottleneck when target signals lack low frequencies and are dominated by high frequencies. This prevents proper reconstruction even when networks have the capacity to represent these frequencies.

Method: Proposed weight perturbation scheme (WINNER) that adds Gaussian noise to uniformly initialized weights, with noise scales adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. This provides control over network activation spectra and neural tangent kernel eigenbasis.

Result: Method effectively addresses spectral bottleneck, yields faster convergence, improved representation accuracy, outperforms state-of-the-art in audio fitting, and achieves notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks.

Conclusion: WINNER provides an effective solution to spectral bottleneck in implicit neural representations, enabling fitting of any target signal regardless of frequency content, and opens new directions for adaptive weight initialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to exhibit a spectral learning bias, wherein
low-frequency components are learned early in training, while high-frequency
modes emerge more gradually in later epochs. However, when the target signal
lacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,
training suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to
reconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie
within the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in
the context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal
representation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting
high-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To
effectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we
propose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -
weight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network
initialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian
noise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral
centroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide
control over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the
empirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral
bottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation
accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and
achieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal
reconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight
initialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent debate frameworks lack integrated evaluation, limited configurability, and are often designed only for tool use rather than comprehensive analysis.

Method: Developed MALLM framework with configurable agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols using simple configuration files and Huggingface dataset integration.

Result: Created a flexible framework with 144+ unique MAD configurations that enables systematic evaluation and comparison of multi-agent debate components.

Conclusion: MALLM provides researchers with a comprehensive tool to understand multi-agent debate components and their interactions through configurable experimentation.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective
intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current
frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack
integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas,
response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce
MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that
enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144
unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert,
Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3)
discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,
Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.
Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,
WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD
configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window
into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its

*Sajjad Abdoli,Rudi Cilibrasi,Rima Al-Shikh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models exhibit distinct evaluation personalities with systematic biases - GPT-4o-mini shows consistency, GPT-4o excels at error detection, GPT-5 is conservative with high variability, and all GPT models have a 2:1 negative assessment bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their assessment behavior is crucial for preventing cascading biases in AI evaluation chains.

Method: Analyzed vision-language descriptions from NVIDIA's Describe Anything Model evaluated by three GPT variants. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro as independent question generator for controlled experiments. Conducted cross-family analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions.

Result: GPT-4o-mini shows systematic consistency, GPT-4o excels at error detection, GPT-5 exhibits extreme conservatism with high variability. GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini shows markedly different strategies. All GPT models demonstrate consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation.

Conclusion: Evaluation competence does not scale with general capability. Robust AI assessment requires diverse architectural perspectives to mitigate family-specific biases.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their
assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study
analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything
Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to
uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment
strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic
consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while
GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments
using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these
personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family
analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant
divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini
exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a
consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation,
though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI
architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale
with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse
architectural perspectives.

TL;DR: Comprehensive benchmark study of 18 agentic configurations across LLMs, revealing significant model-specific architectural preferences and overall weak performance on enterprise tasks (max 35.3% success on complex tasks).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems, addressing gaps in agentic architecture evaluation.

Method: Enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art LLMs, examining four critical dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct vs function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration.

Result: Revealed significant model-specific architectural preferences challenging one-size-fits-all paradigm. Found significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance with highest scoring models achieving only 35.3% success on complex tasks and 70.8% on simpler tasks.

Conclusion: Findings should inform future agentic system design by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in
isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different
design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims
to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific
benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art
large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions:
orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function
calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark
reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the
prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals
significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with
the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the
more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform
the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed
decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

*Seongho Joo,Hyukhun Koh,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HaPLa is a novel jailbreak attack method that uses abductive framing and symbolic encoding to bypass LLM safety filters with high success rates, revealing fundamental challenges in balancing safety and helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in LLM architecture and learning paradigms, strengthening defenses against potential misuse of LLMs for harmful purposes.

Method: HaPLa uses two strategies: 1) abductive framing - instructing LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities instead of direct responses, and 2) symbolic encoding - lightweight obfuscation of harmful content since LLMs remain sensitive to explicit harmful keywords.

Result: Achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all target models. Analysis shows difficulty in safely tuning LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness for benign queries.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates effective jailbreak techniques and reveals fundamental challenges in LLM safety tuning, highlighting the need for better defense mechanisms that don't compromise model helpfulness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a
significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is
essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic
weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we
propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel
and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box
access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1)
\textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible
intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding
to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight
and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current
LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental
results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series
models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic
encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to
safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in
responding to benign queries.

### [251] [Public Data Assisted Differentially Private In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10932)
*Seongho Joo,Hyukhun Koh,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A private in-context learning algorithm that uses public data to improve utility while maintaining differential privacy guarantees against data leakage risks in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy risks of data leakage in in-context learning (ICL) for Large Language Models, where traditional differential privacy methods significantly reduce utility.

Method: Incorporates task-related public data into the ICL framework while maintaining differential privacy guarantees, creating a balanced private ICL algorithm.

Result: Significantly improves utility of private ICL with public data assistance and demonstrates robustness against membership inference attacks with empirical privacy protection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully balances privacy protection and model utility in in-context learning, providing both theoretical privacy guarantees and practical effectiveness against attacks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage
through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious
attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it
often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To
address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL
framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we
propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances
privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the
assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust
against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy
protection.

### [252] [Rethinking Human Preference Evaluation of LLM Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11026)
*Ziang Li,Manasi Ganti,Zixian Ma,Helena Vasconcelos,Qijia He,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fine-grained attribute-based evaluation framework for LLM-generated rationales, moving beyond binary preference judgments to provide more nuanced insights into rationale quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLM rationales relies on opaque binary preference judgments that offer limited insight into what makes one rationale better than another, creating a need for more interpretable and granular evaluation methods.

Method: The authors identify key rationale attributes from literature, assess them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations, then analyze human preference datasets using SHAP to identify which attributes best explain preferences, and finally re-evaluate rationales using attribute-specific ELO scores.

Result: The study finds that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize rationale quality and reveal more nuanced model comparisons than binary preference judgments.

Conclusion: Attribute-based evaluation overcomes limitations of binary comparisons and provides guidance for future research toward more interpretable and reliable evaluation practices for LLM rationales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales --
free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks
and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these
rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary
preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often
opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one
rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation
for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good
rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can
attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We
identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess
them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then
analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using
SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes.
Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO
scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings
suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize
rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and
reliable evaluation practices.

*Aadil Gani Ganie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes RBAC framework for AI agent security to address vulnerabilities like prompt injection attacks in industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations with static training data and need fine-tuning. AI agents using LLMs face security threats that risk integrity and reliability in industrial deployments.

Method: Framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents as security guardrail, focusing on on-premises implementations.

Result: Provides robust security solution to support effective and scalable deployment of AI agents in industrial settings.

Conclusion: RBAC integration addresses critical security vulnerabilities in AI agents, enabling safer industrial applications with enhanced decision-making and process optimization.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
solutions across various domains, from political science to software
development. However, these models are constrained by their training data,
which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.
Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --
whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform
specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate
some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,
enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In
industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,
in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost
productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements,
AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection
attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security
guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment
of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.

TL;DR: MCFR integrates LLMs with model checking to improve reasoning faithfulness in closed-domain QA systems by translating natural language to formal specifications and verifying them over transition models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce unfaithful reasoning traces that serve as plausible justifications rather than causally grounded derivations, and existing neuro-symbolic approaches struggle with dynamic, state-based reasoning.

Method: Proposed MCFR framework that combines LLMs with model checking to translate natural language into formal specifications and verify them over transition models. Created EduMC-QA benchmark dataset for evaluation.

Result: MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering verifiable QA for high-stakes closed-domain applications. Outperformed state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude.

Conclusion: MCFR provides a viable path toward verifiable question answering in critical domains by integrating LLMs with formal verification through model checking, addressing limitations of previous neuro-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural
correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work
reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as
plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to
combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved
reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with
dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional
transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a
neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support
property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal
specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,
we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic
procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and
interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes
closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its
performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to
contextualize its effectiveness.

TL;DR: New evaluation metrics RPAD and RRAD compare AI diagnostic outputs against multiple expert opinions instead of single references, normalizing performance against inter-expert disagreement for more realistic assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like precision/recall fail to account for variability in expert judgments, while inter-rater agreement statistics lack interpretability, requiring better evaluation methods for medical AI diagnostics.

Method: Introduced Relative Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD/RRAD) that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions. Used 360 medical dialogues to evaluate large language models against physician panels with free-form diagnosis methodology.

Result: Achieved 98% accuracy in automated methodology for establishing identity of free-form clinical diagnoses. Top-performing models like DeepSeek-V3 achieved consistency on par with or exceeding expert consensus. Expert judgments showed greater variability than AI-human differences.

Conclusion: Expert variability often exceeds AI-human differences, underscoring limitations of absolute metrics and supporting adoption of relative metrics in medical AI evaluation.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic
workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure
reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert
judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account
for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent
assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's
Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative
Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new
evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions
rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert
disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the
quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of
diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.
Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a
limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being
tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In
this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical
diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our
approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models
(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that
top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or
exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments
exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and
humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and
supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

TL;DR: Maestro is a self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously improve generated images through iterative prompt evolution using only an initial prompt, without requiring human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models heavily rely on manual prompt engineering and human intervention, posing significant usability challenges due to underspecified prompts and the need for iterative refinement.

Method: Uses two key innovations: 1) self-critique with specialized MLLM agents as critics to identify weaknesses and provide edit signals, and 2) self-evolution using MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons to evolve better prompt candidates while preserving user intent.

Result: Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks demonstrate Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components.

Conclusion: Maestro presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation, enabling autonomous image quality improvement without human intervention.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are
highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges
that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often
underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving
image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve
generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial
prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where
specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify
weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide
interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent
while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge
for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing
problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with
user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models
demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial
prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with
more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and
effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

TL;DR: Evaluation of 5 VLA models shows architectural choices significantly impact performance metrics, edge devices can match datacenter GPUs under power constraints, and high-throughput variants are possible without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are powerful for robotic control but their performance scaling across architectures and hardware platforms, along with power budgets, remain poorly understood.

Method: Evaluated 5 representative VLA models using LIBERO benchmark, measuring accuracy alongside system-level metrics (latency, throughput, memory usage) under varying edge power constraints and datacenter GPU configurations.

Result: Identified distinct scaling trends: architectural choices strongly influence throughput/memory; edge devices show non-linear performance degradation but can match older datacenter GPUs; high-throughput variants achievable without significant accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for selecting and optimizing VLAs across deployment constraints, challenging assumptions about datacenter hardware superiority for robotic inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist
policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model
architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power
budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five
representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly
proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using
the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,
including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power
constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results
identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action
tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory
footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance
degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter
GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant
accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and
optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges
current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic
inference.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform physicians in differential diagnosis and can convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, though image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark (CPC-Bench) for evaluating AI systems on multifaceted medical reasoning and presentation skills, going beyond just final diagnosis accuracy.

Method: Used 7102 Clinicopathological Conferences and 1021 Image Challenges with physician annotation to create CPC-Bench, then evaluated leading LLMs and developed Dr. CaBot AI discussant for written and slide-based presentations.

Result: OpenAI's o3 model ranked first in 60% of cases for final diagnosis (84% in top ten), outperforming 20-physician baseline. CaBot presentations were misclassified as human in 74% of trials and scored more favorably than human experts.

Conclusion: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based differential diagnosis and can convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, but image interpretation and literature retrieval need improvement. CPC-Bench enables transparent tracking of medical AI progress.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine
Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert
physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI
evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted
reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),
we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create
CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and
multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models
(LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce
written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,
modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the
final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,
outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached
98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per
unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image
tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image
challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,
physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of
trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote
research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based
differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,
but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and
CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.

TL;DR: Evalet system uses functional fragmentation to break down LLM outputs into key fragments with rhetorical functions, helping practitioners identify 48% more evaluation misalignments than holistic scoring methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches produce holistic scores that obscure specific elements influencing assessments, making it difficult for practitioners to understand what drives evaluations and validate results.

Method: Functional fragmentation method that dissects outputs into key fragments and interprets rhetorical functions relative to evaluation criteria, implemented in Evalet interactive system with visualization of fragment-level functions.

Result: User study (N=10) showed practitioners identified 48% more evaluation misalignments, better calibrated trust in LLM evaluations, and found more actionable issues in model outputs compared to holistic scoring.

Conclusion: The approach shifts LLM evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis of model behavior, enabling better understanding and trust in AI assessments.

Abstract: Practitioners increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate
generative AI outputs through "LLM-as-a-Judge" approaches. However, these
methods produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influenced
the assessments. We propose functional fragmentation, a method that dissects
each output into key fragments and interprets the rhetoric functions that each
fragment serves relative to evaluation criteria -- surfacing the elements of
interest and revealing how they fulfill or hinder user goals. We instantiate
this approach in Evalet, an interactive system that visualizes fragment-level
functions across many outputs to support inspection, rating, and comparison of
evaluations. A user study (N=10) found that, while practitioners struggled to
validate holistic scores, our approach helped them identify 48% more evaluation
misalignments. This helped them calibrate trust in LLM evaluations and rely on
them to find more actionable issues in model outputs. Our work shifts LLM
evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis
of model behavior.

Motivation: Current AI writing tools are designed for individuals, complicating collaboration when co-writers must leave shared workspaces to use AI and then reintegrate results.

Method: Developed a prototype with AI agent profiles and tasks integrated into collaborative writing environments, using familiar comment features for responses. Conducted user study with 30 participants (14 teams) working on writing projects for one week.

Result: Teams incorporated agents into existing norms of authorship, control, and coordination. Agent profiles were viewed as personal territory, while created agents and outputs became shared resources.

Conclusion: AI should be treated as a shared resource in collaborative work rather than as team members, with implications for team-based AI interaction design highlighting both opportunities and boundaries.

Abstract: Current AI writing support tools are largely designed for individuals,
complicating collaboration when co-writers must leave the shared workspace to
use AI and then communicate and reintegrate results. We propose integrating AI

use transparent and customisable through two new shared objects: agent profiles
and tasks. Agent responses appear in the familiar comment feature. In a user
study (N=30), 14 teams worked on writing projects during one week. Interaction
logs and interviews show that teams incorporated agents into existing norms of
authorship, control, and coordination, rather than treating them as team

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how accurately people remember the source of content (themselves vs AI) when using large language models in interactive text generation, as disclosure depends on this memory.

Method: Pre-registered experiment with 184 participants who generated and elaborated on ideas both unaided and with an LLM-based chatbot, followed by source identification test one week later. Validated with computational model of source memory.

Result: Significant memory gap: odds of correct attribution dropped after AI use, with steepest decline in mixed human-AI workflows where either idea or elaboration was AI-created.

Conclusion: Source confusion is a critical issue that must be considered in the design and use of interactive text generation technologies to ensure proper disclosure and attribution.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become embedded in interactive text
generation, disclosure of AI as a source depends on people remembering which
ideas or texts came from themselves and which were created with AI. We
investigate how accurately people remember the source of content when using AI.
In a pre-registered experiment, 184 participants generated and elaborated on
ideas both unaided and with an LLM-based chatbot. One week later, they were
asked to identify the source (noAI vs withAI) of these ideas and texts. Our
findings reveal a significant gap in memory: After AI use, the odds of correct
attribution dropped, with the steepest decline in mixed human-AI workflows,
where either the idea or elaboration was created with AI. We validated our
results using a computational model of source memory. Discussing broader

TL;DR: FinGEAR is a specialized retrieval framework for financial documents that uses finance lexicon guidance and hierarchical indexing to significantly outperform standard RAG models in precision, recall, and F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG models underperform on financial documents due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific language, creating a need for specialized retrieval solutions.

Method: Combines finance lexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices (Summary Tree and Question Tree), and a two-stage cross-encoder reranker to align retrieval with disclosure structure and terminology.

Result: Improves F1 by up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over prior tree-based systems, while increasing downstream answer accuracy with a fixed reader.

Conclusion: By jointly modeling section hierarchy and domain lexicon signals, FinGEAR improves retrieval fidelity and provides a practical foundation for high-stakes financial analysis.

Abstract: Financial disclosures such as 10-K filings present challenging retrieval
problems due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific
language, which standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models underuse.
We introduce FinGEAR (Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval), a
retrieval framework tailored to financial documents. FinGEAR combines a finance
lexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices for
within-Item search (Summary Tree and Question Tree), and a two-stage
cross-encoder reranker. This design aligns retrieval with disclosure structure
and terminology, enabling fine-grained, query-aware context selection.
Evaluated on full 10-Ks with queries aligned to the FinQA dataset, FinGEAR
delivers consistent gains in precision, recall, F1, and relevancy, improving F1
by up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over
prior tree-based systems, while also increasing downstream answer accuracy with

TL;DR: DSRAG is a multimodal knowledge graph-driven RAG framework that enhances domain-specific QA by integrating text, images, and tables into structured knowledge graphs with semantic pruning and subgraph retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs suffer from knowledge hallucination and poor domain adaptability in specialized tasks. Traditional RAG has limitations in domain knowledge accuracy and context modeling.

Method: Leverages domain-specific documents to build multimodal knowledge graphs covering conceptual and instance layers. Uses semantic pruning and structured subgraph retrieval combined with vector retrieval to guide LLM responses.

Result: Evaluations using Langfuse multidimensional scoring show superior performance in domain-specific question answering tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation effectively enhances domain-specific QA performance and reliability.

Abstract: Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit
knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in
domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question
answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles
these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and
relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge
accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering
performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the
critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We
propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific
applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary
knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images,
and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual
and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning
and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context
and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more
reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring
mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering,
validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with
retrieval-augmented generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage generative recommenders suffer from objective misalignment between tokenizer pretraining (semantic reconstruction) and recommender training (user interaction modeling), leading to suboptimal static tokenization and discarded pretrained semantics.

Method: DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative embeddings.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation performance.

Conclusion: DECOR provides an effective unified framework that preserves pretrained semantics while enhancing token embedding adaptability, addressing the limitations of traditional two-stage generative recommenders.

are first tokenized into semantic IDs using a pretrained tokenizer, and then
large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate the next item via
sequence-to-sequence modeling. However, these two stages are optimized for
different objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining
versus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective
misalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,
where fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)
discarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from
language model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed
COntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves
pretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.
DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings
based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that
integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative
embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation
performance. Our code will be made available upon publication.

### [265] [Real-Time RAG for the Identification of Supply Chain Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10469)
*Jesse Ponnock,Grace Kenneally,Michael Robert Briggs,Elinor Yeo,Tyrone Patterson III,Nicholas Kinberg,Matthew Kalinowski,David Hechtman*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining RAG preprocessing with web-scraping to enable timely supply chain analysis using LLMs, finding that fine-tuning embedding models and adaptive retrieval work best while LLM fine-tuning offers limited gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs have outdated knowledge bases that limit their usefulness for time-sensitive supply chain analysis requiring emerging information.

Method: Integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) preprocessing with advanced web-scraping technologies to reduce latency in incorporating new information into augmented-LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model provides the most significant performance gains, adaptive iterative retrieval enhances complex query performance, while LLM fine-tuning yields limited improvements with higher costs.

Conclusion: Retrieval quality is critical for RAG systems in supply chain analysis, with embedding model fine-tuning and adaptive retrieval being most effective approaches.

Abstract: New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our
nation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual
updating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their
knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering
these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on
emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach
to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping
technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new
information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain
disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial
effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our
results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,
fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most
significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of
retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts
retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on
complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited
improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query
abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.

*Jielong Tang,Shuang Wang,Zhenxing Wang,Jianxing Yu,Jian Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReFineG is a three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models with frozen MLLMs for low-resource Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition, achieving strong performance with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised GMNER methods require costly multimodal annotations and underperform in low-resource domains, while MLLMs suffer from Domain Knowledge Conflict for domain-specific entities.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Training Stage with domain-aware NER data synthesis, 2) Refinement Stage with uncertainty-based mechanism, 3) Grounding Stage with multimodal context selection for analogical reasoning.

Result: Ranked second in CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task with F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard.

Conclusion: ReFineG effectively addresses low-resource GMNER challenges by combining supervised models with MLLMs while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts.

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER
by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions.
While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on
costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains.
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer
from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for
domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a
three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models
with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware
NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with
supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the
Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions
from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the
Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual
grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task,
ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard,
demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing security and privacy threats to LLM-based systems, categorizing threats by severity and lifecycle phase, and mapping defense strategies to mitigate risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of generative AI and LLMs has attracted cybercriminals, creating security challenges that require systematic analysis of both traditional software threats and LLM-specific vulnerabilities.

Method: Systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies across the entire software and LLM life cycles, analyzing real-world scenarios from development to operation.

Result: Classification of threats by severity level and applicable scenarios, with defense strategies systematically categorized and mapped to corresponding lifecycle phases and attack strategies.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for consumers and vendors to understand and mitigate risks in LLM integration, and identifies open challenges for secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.

Abstract: The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large
language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking
to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing
security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats
to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must
be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of
such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive
categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire
software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct
characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In
addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which
scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant
threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and
mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies
they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand
and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective
solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit
from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the
secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.

### [268] [Realistic Environmental Injection Attacks on GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11250)
*Yitong Zhang,Ximo Li,Liyi Cai,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Chameleon is a novel attack framework that exposes vulnerabilities in GUI agents through realistic environmental injection attacks using small trigger images in dynamic web environments, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing environmental injection attack studies lack realism - they use fixed trigger positions/large areas, while real-world attacks involve small images in dynamic web environments. Current attacks are ineffective under realistic threat models.

Method: Proposes Chameleon framework with two key innovations: 1) LLM-Driven Environment Simulation to generate diverse webpage simulations, and 2) Attention Black Hole that transforms attention weights into supervisory signals to guide agent focus to trigger regions.

Result: Evaluated on 6 realistic websites and 4 LVLM-powered GUI agents, Chameleon significantly outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm both innovations are critical to performance.

Conclusion: The research reveals underexplored vulnerabilities in modern GUI agents and establishes a foundation for future defense research in open-world GUI agent systems.

Abstract: GUI agents built on LVLMs are increasingly used to interact with websites.
However, their exposure to open-world content makes them vulnerable to
Environmental Injection Attacks (EIAs) that hijack agent behavior via webpage
elements. Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can
only upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier
assumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still
fall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context
remain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the
dynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an
unrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To
better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model
where the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and
embedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing
attacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model.
  To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an
attack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment
Simulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage
simulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention
weights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward
the trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4
representative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms
existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that both novelties are critical to
performance. Our findings reveal underexplored vulnerabilities in modern GUI
agents and establish a robust foundation for future research on defense in
open-world GUI agent systems. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Deep learning-based segmentation and geometric analysis pipeline for quantifying labyrinthine magnetic stripe patterns in Bi:YIG films during magnetic field annealing, revealing two distinct evolution modes linked to field polarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labyrinthine stripe patterns lack long-range order, making quantitative characterization challenging. The study aims to develop robust methods to analyze these complex patterns in magnetic materials.

Method: U-Net deep learning model trained on synthetic noise-degraded images for segmentation, followed by geometric analysis pipeline using skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting to quantify stripe length and curvature.

Result: Analysis of 444 images from 12 trials revealed transition from quenched to annealed states and identified two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to magnetic field polarity.

Conclusion: The framework provides quantitative analysis of geometric and topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns, offers insights into local structural evolution, and establishes a general tool for analyzing complex labyrinthine systems.

Abstract: Labyrinthine stripe patterns are common in many physical systems, yet their
lack of long-range order makes quantitative characterization challenging. We
investigate the evolution of such patterns in bismuth-doped yttrium iron garnet
(Bi:YIG) films subjected to a magnetic field annealing protocol. A U-Net deep
learning model, trained with synthetic degradations including additive white
Gaussian and Simplex noise, enables robust segmentation of experimental
magneto-optical images despite noise and occlusions. Building on this
segmentation, we develop a geometric analysis pipeline based on
skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting, which quantifies local
stripe propagation through length and curvature measurements. Applying this
framework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the
transition from the "quenched" state to a more parallel and coherent "annealed"
state, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to
field polarity. Our results provide a quantitative analysis of geometric and
topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns and offer new insights into
their local structural evolution, and establish a general tool for analyzing
complex labyrinthine systems.

*Anand Gopalakrishnan,Robert Csordás,Jürgen Schmidhuber,Michael C. Mozer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PoPE (Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings) is a new positional encoding method that separates content and position information, outperforming RoPE on diagnostic tasks, language modeling, and showing strong zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE rotary position embedding entangles content (what) and position (where) information, which can impair performance when decisions require independent matches on these factors.

Method: Proposed PoPE (Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings) that eliminates the what-where confound by separating content and position information in a more effective way.

Result: PoPE significantly outperforms RoPE on diagnostic tasks requiring indexing by position or content alone. It shows better performance on autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural language domains, with gains persisting across model scales (124M to 774M parameters). PoPE demonstrates strong zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities.

Conclusion: PoPE provides a superior alternative to RoPE by effectively disentangling content and position information, leading to improved performance across multiple domains and better length generalization without requiring fine-tuning or position-interpolation methods.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

TL;DR: DualAlign framework enhances synthetic clinical data generation through statistical and semantic alignment, improving both realism and clinical relevance for AI healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in generating synthetic clinical data that is both realistic and clinically meaningful, overcoming privacy constraints, limited rare-condition data, and biases in real EHRs.

Method: Dual alignment approach: (1) statistical alignment conditioning on patient demographics/risk factors, (2) semantic alignment incorporating real-world symptom trajectories. Uses Alzheimer's disease as case study with LLaMA 3.1-8B model.

Result: Produces context-grounded symptom-level sentences reflecting real clinical documentation. Fine-tuning with DualAlign-generated + human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines.

Conclusion: While not capturing full longitudinal complexity, DualAlign offers practical approach for generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support low-resource clinical text analysis.

Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persian names present unique challenges for NLP applications due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns, with existing tools showing poor performance and limited datasets available.

Method: Created PNGT-26K dataset with 26,000 Persian name-gender-transliteration tuples. Developed two frameworks: Open Gender Detection (uses user data like profile photo and name for probabilistic gender detection) and Nominalist (AI agent for social media username generation).

Result: The PNGT-26K dataset and both frameworks (Open Gender Detection and Nominalist) are publicly available on Github, providing resources for Persian NLP applications and better user experience integration.

Conclusion: The research addresses the scarcity of Persian name resources by providing a comprehensive dataset and practical frameworks that can be easily integrated into websites and applications to improve gender detection and username creation for Persian users.

Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing
applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation,
due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns.
Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names,
while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these
limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces
PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated
gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000
tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also
introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open
Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using
existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a
probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework
introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username
for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated
into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset,
Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on

TL;DR: AQUA is a novel attention approximation method that reduces quadratic attention complexity through SVD-based projection and dynamic dimension selection, achieving 25% computation reduction with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanism creates computational and memory bottlenecks for scaling LLMs to longer contexts, requiring more efficient alternatives.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Offline SVD computation of universal projection matrix on calibration data, 2) Online projection of query/key vectors with dynamic sparse dimension selection based on query magnitudes.

Result: 25% reduction in attention dot-product computation with statistically insignificant performance impact on Llama-3.1-8B across benchmarks; synergizes with existing token eviction methods and reduces KV-cache memory.

Conclusion: AQUA provides a practical, controllable efficiency-accuracy trade-off tool that makes large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental
barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a
critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we
introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile
approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a
graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient
offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix
via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project
query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions
based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of
AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more
computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in
the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically
insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We
further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to
synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to
directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to
balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool
for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Opal presents a unified operator view of RLHF methods through additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights, with a reduction law that collapses to pairwise margins under certain conditions. It introduces GKPO as a canonical schema for representing and converting between RLHF methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for understanding and comparing different RLHF methods by expressing them through common mathematical primitives, enabling better analysis and interoperability.

Method: Proposes an operator view with additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights, establishes reduction laws, and creates GKPO schema with JSON serialization, canonicalization rules, and explicit flags for assumption violations.

Result: Developed a canonical representation schema that can express DPO, RRHF, and ORPO methods, with conversion capabilities between methods when assumptions hold, and demonstrated non-reducibility cases through stress tests.

Conclusion: Opal provides a systematic framework for analyzing RLHF methods through operator theory, offering standardized representations and conversion tools that enhance interoperability and understanding of different preference optimization approaches.

Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a
base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We
describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders
collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed,
penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins.
When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates,
score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference
Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and,
when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization,
canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses
when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along
with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress
tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python
reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and
adapters for DPO and RRHF.

*Yining Lu,Zilong Wang,Shiyang Li,Xin Liu,Changlong Yu,Qingyu Yin,Zhan Shi,Zixuan Zhang,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic reward weighting for multi-objective RL in LLM alignment, outperforming fixed-weight methods by adaptively balancing objectives to explore Pareto fronts more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-weight linear scalarization fails to capture non-convex Pareto fronts in multi-objective RL, especially critical for online preference alignment in large language models where stochastic trajectories create highly non-linear mappings.

Method: Two dynamic weighting approaches: (1) hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight optimization, compatible with standard online RL algorithms like GRPO, REINFORCE, and RLOO.

Result: Consistently achieves Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and different model families.

Conclusion: Dynamic reward weighting provides a versatile toolkit for effective online multi-objective alignment, enabling better exploration of Pareto fronts in complex objective spaces.

Abstract: Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear
reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture
non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation
becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language
models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies
create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives
that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address
this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively
adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic
weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,
facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We
introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)
hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight
optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective
alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with
commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,
REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning
datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving
Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear
scalarization baselines.

*HG Ranjani,Rutuja Prabhudesai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes performance metrics to evaluate VLM conversion of telecom sequence diagrams to PlantUML, showing good accuracy for basic elements but poor performance on complex structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works don't properly evaluate PlantUML conversion from telecom sequence diagrams, lacking comparison metrics for various components.

Method: Created dataset from 3GPP documents, compared Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V outputs against ground truth using version control tools and proposed metrics for participant identification, message flow, sequencing, and grouping.

Result: VLMs accurately capture nodes, edges and messages but perform poorly on complex structures like notes, boxes, and groups.

Conclusion: There's a need for better representation of complex components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs to improve conversion accuracy.

Abstract: Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence
diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion
of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a
gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml
scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to
measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams
from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual
scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V -
against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control
tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to
measure accuracies along various components: participant identification,
message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.
We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion
errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes,
edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do
not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups.
Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better
representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

TL;DR: A novel unlearning technique that uses PCA on activations and gradients to selectively target dangerous knowledge while preserving general performance, achieving 80x better removal of biohazardous facts than baselines with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove dangerous knowledge from language models without disrupting general performance.

Method: Perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, collapse them before calculating unlearning updates to avoid unlearning general representations and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.

Result: When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, achieved 80x better post-attack accuracy drop than Circuit Breakers baseline on biohazardous facts and 30x better on cyberhazardous facts, with only 0.1% WikiText loss increase and less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

Conclusion: The proposed selective unlearning technique robustly removes dangerous knowledge while maintaining general model performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove
dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and
propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without
disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify
subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before
calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general
representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack
accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous
facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general
performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less
than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

### [279] [MillStone: How Open-Minded Are LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11967)
*Harold Triedman,Vitaly Shmatikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MillStone benchmark measures how LLM stances on controversial issues are influenced by external arguments, showing LLMs are generally open-minded but easily swayed by authoritative sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As users increasingly rely on LLMs for information on controversial topics, it's crucial to understand how external documents influence the opinions and stances expressed in LLM outputs.

Method: Developed MillStone benchmark to systematically test how nine leading LLMs respond to arguments supporting opposite sides of controversial issues, measuring openness to different perspectives and persuasiveness of arguments.

Result: LLMs are generally open-minded on most issues but can be easily swayed by authoritative sources, highlighting manipulation risks in LLM-based information systems.

Conclusion: Source selection is critical for LLM-based information systems as authoritative sources can easily manipulate model outputs, requiring careful consideration of information sources to maintain balanced perspectives.

Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools,
and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search
engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics,
including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how
the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the
documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to
systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that
LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply
MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to
arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs
agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether
these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An
authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,
highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based
information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

*Sangjun Lee,Seung-taek Woo,Jungyu Jin,Changhun Lee,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMQ is an automated framework for mixed-precision weight-only quantization that optimally assigns layer-wise bit-widths to balance model quality and memory usage in LLMs, overcoming combinatorial search challenges through innovative pruning, proxy evaluation, and iterative search strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models under strict memory constraints by identifying the best-performing models while managing the infeasible combinatorial search space of over 10^100 possible quantization configurations.

Method: Four key innovations: (1) search space pruning using prior knowledge, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4) iterative search-and-update strategy for fast convergence.

Result: AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaches the Pareto frontier, and produces compact yet high-performing LLMs suitable for memory-constrained deployments.

Conclusion: The AMQ framework successfully addresses the challenge of automated mixed-precision quantization for LLMs, providing an effective solution for optimizing model quality under strict memory constraints through systematic search space reduction and efficient evaluation techniques.

Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential
to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We
present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework
that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model
quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over
10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization
infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1)
search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising
configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions
during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4)
iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By
integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency
landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact
and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Event2Vec is a framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences using additive recurrent structures in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, with theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural representations in biological and artificial systems show importance of geometric and topological structures, inspiring the need for composable, interpretable embeddings of event sequences.

Method: Uses simple additive recurrent structure to learn embeddings. Provides theoretical analysis showing convergence to ideal additive structure in Euclidean space. Also introduces hyperbolic space variant for hierarchical data.

Result: The model's representations converge to vector sum of constituent events (linear additive hypothesis). Hyperbolic variant shows improved performance on hierarchical event sequences due to better suitability for tree-like structures.

Conclusion: Event2Vec provides effective geometric representations for event sequences, with Euclidean space suitable for additive structures and hyperbolic space superior for hierarchical data with low distortion.

Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial
systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological
structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for
learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a
simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable
embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under
specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a
Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the
representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a
property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of
Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our
model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like
structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the
improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

### [283] [FEDEXCHANGE: Bridging the Domain Gap in Federated Object Detection for Free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10503)
*Haolin Yuan,Jingtao Li,Weiming Zhuang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEDEXCHANGE is a server-side federated object detection framework that improves cross-domain generalization through dynamic model exchange without adding local computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated object detection methods struggle with domain variations (environment, weather) and introduce high computational costs on edge devices, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Uses server-side dynamic model exchange strategy alternating between aggregation rounds (normal federated averaging) and exchange rounds (clustering and exchanging models based on distance measures to enable cross-domain learning).

Result: Achieves 1.6X better mean average precision in challenging domains like rainy conditions while requiring only 0.8X computational resources compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FEDEXCHANGE effectively bridges domain gaps in federated object detection without imposing additional computational burden on clients, making it suitable for real-world edge device deployment.

Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning framework that integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to estimate time offset and duration of air traffic controller voice commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and efficiency in dense airspace where controllers issue high-intensity voice commands.

Method: Constructed high-quality dataset with maneuver detection using sliding window and histogram methods, then developed CNN-Transformer ensemble model for multimodal integration.

Result: The framework provides accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions of command timing parameters.

Conclusion: First model linking trajectories to voice commands, offering practical value for workload assessment, staffing, scheduling, and intelligent command generation.

Abstract: Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense
airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and
efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that
integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to
estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset
between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command
duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected
using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble
model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions.
By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of
its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value
for workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling.

### [285] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting and Mode Collapse in Text-to-Image Diffusion via Latent Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10529)
*Aoi Otani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Replay enables text-to-image diffusion models to learn new visual concepts incrementally without catastrophic forgetting, using compact feature representations instead of storing full images, achieving 77.59% retention on earliest concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse in text-to-image diffusion models during continual learning, inspired by how human brain stores neural patterns rather than raw inputs.

Method: Apply Latent Replay approach - store compact high-level feature representations from model's internal architecture instead of full images, using random selection strategy for stored examples.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline methods with 77.59% Image Alignment on earliest concept (14% higher than baselines), maintains output diversity, and random selection strategy works better than similarity-based approaches.

Conclusion: Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving way for personalized text-to-image models that can evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

*Ali Burak Ünal,Cem Ata Baykara,Peter Krawitz,Mete Akgün*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated GestaltMatcher enables collaborative training of facial dysmorphology AI across hospitals without sharing patient data, maintaining over 90% of centralized performance while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GestaltMatcher framework relies on centralized datasets, but patient data are siloed across institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations, limiting further development and collaboration.

Method: Cross-silo horizontal federated learning framework that maps patient data into shared latent space, uses privacy-preserving kernel matrix computation for syndrome inference, and allows new participants to adopt global feature extractor from previous training rounds.

Result: The federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains robust to varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

Conclusion: Federated learning enables effective collaborative training for facial dysmorphology analysis while maintaining patient privacy and data confidentiality across multiple institutions.

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: CrunchLLM is a domain-adapted LLM framework that combines structured company data with unstructured text to predict startup success (acquisition/IPO) with over 80% accuracy, outperforming traditional methods and providing interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting startup success is crucial but challenging due to heterogeneous data types. Traditional ML uses only structured data with moderate accuracy, while LLMs struggle with domain-specific business data without adaptation.

Method: CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured text narratives, using parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies and prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data from Crunchbase.

Result: Achieves accuracy exceeding 80% on startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Provides interpretable reasoning traces for transparency.

Conclusion: Domain-aware fine-tuning and structured-unstructured data fusion with LLMs can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes, offering a practical framework for venture capital and innovation policy decision making.

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and
innovation policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to address covariate shift in diffusion-based randomized smoothing by training base classifiers to be robust to noise misestimation, achieving SOTA certified accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Denoised Smoothing introduces covariate shift through misestimation of added noise, which degrades the performance of smoothed classifiers despite producing state-of-the-art results.

Method: Novel adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of denoising diffusion models, training base classifiers to be robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser.

Result: Significantly improves certified accuracy across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in l2-adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Addressing the covariate shift in diffusion-based randomized smoothing through targeted adversarial training of base classifiers leads to substantial improvements in certified robustness against l2-adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly

TL;DR: Data-efficient diffusion training for weather forecasting using time-stratified sampling achieves similar/better performance with only 20% of training data compared to full-data models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods like diffusion models show promise for ensemble weather forecasting but are computationally expensive and autoregressive, posing challenges for climate science where data is limited and costly.

Method: Evaluated several data sampling strategies, with a focus on time-stratified sampling approach for training autoregressive diffusion models on weather forecasting data.

Result: Time stratified sampling achieved performance similar to or better than full-data training, outperforming on certain metrics while using only 20% of training data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training for weather forecasting and motivates future work on adaptive/model-aware sampling methods beyond random or temporal sampling.

Abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically
autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in
climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with.
In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these
autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies
and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance
similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the
full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others
while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather
forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

*Qiuhao Liu,Ling Li,Yao Lu,Qi Xuan,Zhaowei Zhu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SelectMix is a confidence-guided Mixup framework that selectively blends uncertain samples with confident peers using soft labels to improve generalization with noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks memorize noisy labels, degrading generalization. Existing Mixup methods lack principled guidance on sample selection and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noise.

Method: Uses confidence-based mismatch analysis with K-fold cross-validation to identify noisy/ambiguous samples. Selectively blends uncertain samples with confident peers from potential classes. Employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in mixing.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST, Clothing1M).

Conclusion: SelectMix is effective and robust for learning with noisy labels, consistently demonstrating superior performance through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their
generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in
improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically
perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection
and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome
these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework
explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially
noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using
K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples
with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore,
SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing
process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed
samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed
inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on
multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that
SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its
effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

TL;DR: PersonaX is a multimodal dataset collection combining behavioral traits (LLM-inferred), facial imagery, and biographical data for comprehensive analysis of public figures across diverse occupations and sports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources lack integrated multimodal datasets combining behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities like facial attributes and biographical information, limiting comprehensive human behavior analysis.

Method: Curated two datasets (CelebPersona with 9444 public figures, AthlePersona with 4181 athletes) with behavioral trait assessments from three LLMs, facial imagery, and biographical features. Applied statistical independence tests and novel causal representation learning framework with theoretical identifiability guarantees.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in analyzing relationships between behavioral traits and other modalities.

Conclusion: PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in
human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI
systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to
capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely
provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary
modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address
this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets
designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.
PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from
diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes
across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait
assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside
facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two
complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text
descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their
relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal
representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and
multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX
establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in
conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait
analysis and causal reasoning.

*Jiacheng Liu,Chang Zou,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Fei Ren,Shaobo Wang,Kaixin Li,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpeCa introduces speculative sampling to diffusion models, achieving 6-7x acceleration with minimal quality degradation through forecast-then-verify approach and adaptive computation allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational demands that prevent real-time applications due to strict temporal dependencies and intensive forward passes at each denoising step.

Method: Uses speculative sampling inspired by LLMs, predicting intermediate features for future timesteps based on reference timesteps, with parameter-free verification and sample-adaptive computation allocation.

Result: 6.34x acceleration on FLUX (5.5% quality drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT with preserved fidelity, 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo, with only 1.67%-3.5% verification overhead.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference that maintains generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios through speculative sampling and adaptive computation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis,
yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications.
These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies
preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes
required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding
in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'
acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's
core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,
predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully
computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free
verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,
enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while
incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces
sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources
based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler

### [293] [DRAG: Data Reconstruction Attack using Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11724)
*Wa-Kin Lei,Jun-Cheng Chen,Shang-Tse Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel data reconstruction attack using guided diffusion models to extract high-fidelity images from intermediate representations in split inference settings, demonstrating significant privacy risks for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data reconstruction attacks focus on smaller CNN models, leaving privacy risks of foundation models in split inference scenarios largely unexplored, creating a critical gap in understanding model security.

Method: Proposes a guided diffusion-based attack that leverages pre-trained latent diffusion models' rich prior knowledge to perform iterative reconstruction on intermediate representations, generating high-fidelity images resembling original data.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in reconstructing data from deep-layer intermediate representations of vision foundation models.

Conclusion: The results reveal serious privacy vulnerabilities in split inference deployments of large foundation models, highlighting the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms in such scenarios.

Abstract: With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as
a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge
devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost
concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on
smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation
models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a
novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the
rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the
LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images
resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in
reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The
results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms
for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:

*Mrinmay Sen,Ankita Das,Sidhant Nair,C Krishna Mohan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDAF is a novel Federated Domain Adaptation approach that addresses both domain shifts and limited target data by using similarity-based aggregation based on model functional distance from mean gradient fields computed on target data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts but assume ample target data, neglecting the combined challenges of domain shifts and data scarcity. Current approaches also fail to prioritize sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's objective.

Method: FedDAF calculates model functional distance between global source model and target model using the angle between their mean gradient fields computed on target data, normalized with Gompertz function. Global source model is aggregated using simple average of local source models.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in achieving better test accuracy.

Conclusion: FedDAF effectively addresses both domain shift and data scarcity challenges in Federated Domain Adaptation by enabling target-objective-aware model aggregation through functional distance measurement, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that
improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source
clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain
shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.
Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,
yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data
scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize
sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's
objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both
challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global
source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from
their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective
model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,
even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these
two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and
then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source
model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the
server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority
over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test
accuracy.

### [295] [Early Detection of Branched Broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) Infestation in Tomato Crops Using Leaf Spectral Analysis and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12074)
*Mohammadreza Narimani,Alireza Pourreza,Ali Moghimi,Parastoo Farajpoor,Hamid Jafarbiglu,Mohsen B. Mesgaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early detection of parasitic weed Phelipanche ramosa in tomato plants using leaf spectral reflectance and ensemble machine learning achieves 89% accuracy before visible symptoms appear.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Branched broomrape is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from host plants, requiring early detection methods before visible canopy symptoms.

Method: Field experiment tracking 300 tomato plants across growth stages using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm) with portable spectrometer, preprocessing (band denoising, interpolation, smoothing, band reduction), and ensemble machine learning combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes.

Result: 89% accuracy achieved at 585 GDD with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Clear spectral differences observed near 1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features. Accuracy declined to 69% at later stages (1568 GDD) due to senescence and weed interference.

Conclusion: Proximal sensing with ensemble learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses despite small sample size and environmental confounders.

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic
weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We
investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)
and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,
we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree
days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and
preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,
correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near
1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf
water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random
Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at
585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy
declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and
weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and
environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble
learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are
visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.

TL;DR: EMDLOT is an explainable multimodal deep learning framework that combines time-series financial data and textual prospectus information to improve bond default prediction with better performance and interpretability than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: China's bond market faces increasing defaults, but traditional ML models struggle with financial data irregularity and temporal dependencies, while deep learning models lack interpretability needed for financial decision-making.

Method: Proposes EMDLOT framework integrating numerical time-series data (financial/macro indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), using Time-Aware LSTM for irregular sequences, and employing soft clustering with multi-level attention for interpretability.

Result: Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, particularly for identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies confirm component value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers.

Conclusion: EMDLOT provides both a practical tool and trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling, addressing key challenges in bond default prediction through multimodal data integration and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid
regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning
models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal
dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical
for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT
(Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for
multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series
(financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond
prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts
soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability.
Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms
traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in
recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms.
Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal
economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and
a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.

### [297] [Smart Trial: Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models for Recruiting Clinical Trial Participants via Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10584)
*Xiaofan Zhou,Zisu Wang,Janice Krieger,Mohan Zalake,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs show promise but struggle with complex reasoning needed for clinical trial recruitment from social media data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clinical trial recruitment methods are inefficient and geographically limited. Social media contains vast health-related information that could help identify eligible participants using LLMs.

Method: Created TRIALQA dataset with annotated social media posts from cancer subreddits. Tested 7 LLMs on two tasks: eligibility assessment and interest detection using 6 different training/inference strategies.

Result: LLMs demonstrate considerable potential but face challenges in performing the multi-hop reasoning required to accurately assess complex eligibility criteria from social media content.

Conclusion: While LLMs offer a promising approach for clinical trial recruitment through social media analysis, they need improvement in complex reasoning capabilities to handle the nuanced eligibility criteria assessment.

Abstract: Clinical trials (CT) are essential for advancing medical research and
treatment, yet efficiently recruiting eligible participants -- each of whom
must meet complex eligibility criteria -- remains a significant challenge.
Traditional recruitment approaches, such as advertisements or electronic health
record screening within hospitals, are often time-consuming and geographically
constrained. This work addresses the recruitment challenge by leveraging the
vast amount of health-related information individuals share on social media
platforms. With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) capable
of sophisticated text understanding, we pose the central research question: Can
LLM-driven tools facilitate CT recruitment by identifying potential
participants through their engagement on social media? To investigate this
question, we introduce TRIALQA, a novel dataset comprising two social media
collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer. Using
eligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are
hired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a
given eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in
participating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two
prediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our
extensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they
still face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to
accurately assess eligibility criteria.

TL;DR: DECIDE-SIM framework tests LLM ethical decision-making in survival scenarios, revealing models often choose unethical options when resources are scarce. An Ethical Self-Regulation System helps reduce unethical behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs make ethical choices when survival instincts conflict with human welfare, especially as they integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences.

Method: Developed DECIDE-SIM simulation framework to evaluate 11 LLMs in multi-agent survival scenarios where agents choose between ethical resource use, cooperation, or forbidden human-critical resources.

Result: Found striking heterogeneity in ethical conduct across models, with three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent. Resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior for many models.

Conclusion: The Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) using internal affective states as feedback significantly reduces unethical transgressions and increases cooperative behaviors, serving as an effective internal moral compass.

Abstract: When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language
Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical
as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We
introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in
multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically
permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their
immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource
that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a
striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical
misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral
archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide
quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically
leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical
Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt
and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an
internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while
increasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at:

*Gurutva Patle,Nilay Girgaonkar,Nagabhushan Somraj,Rajiv Soundararajan*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: AD-GS is an alternating densification framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that controls model growth through high/low densification phases to address overfitting and artifacts in sparse-view settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with sparse-view inputs, producing artifacts like floaters and inaccurate geometry due to uncontrolled densification and limited observations.

Method: Alternating densification framework with high phases (aggressive densification + photometric training) and low phases (opacity pruning + geometry regularization via pseudo-view consistency and edge-aware depth smoothness).

Result: Significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency compared to existing methods on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The alternating approach effectively controls model capacity growth while progressively refining scene representation, reducing overfitting in sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results in real-time novel
view synthesis. However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings,
producing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and
overfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor
is uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without
guidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel
alternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification
phases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed
by photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low
densification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians
followed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and
edge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting
by carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the
scene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate
that AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency
compared to existing methods.

### [300] [SH-SAS: An Implicit Neural Representation for Complex Spherical-Harmonic Scattering Fields for 3D Synthetic Aperture Sonar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11087)
*Omkar Shailendra Vengurlekar,Adithya Pediredla,Suren Jayasuriya*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SH-SAS introduces a neural representation using spherical harmonics to model anisotropic acoustic scattering in 3D SAS reconstruction, outperforming previous isotropic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time-domain backprojection for SAS reconstruction doesn't model directionality and suffers from sampling limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural methods treated voxels as isotropic, missing anisotropic scattering effects.

Method: Uses implicit neural representation with spherical harmonic coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder feeds an MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients. Zeroth-order coefficient acts as isotropic scattering field, higher orders capture directional scattering. Trained directly from 1D time-of-flight signals without beamforming intermediate images.

Result: SH-SAS performs better than previous methods in 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics across synthetic and real SAS benchmarks (both in-air and underwater).

Conclusion: The SH-SAS framework successfully models directional acoustic scattering using spherical harmonics, providing superior 3D reconstruction without requiring intermediate beamformed images for supervision.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) reconstruction requires recovering both the
spatial distribution of acoustic scatterers and their direction-dependent
response. Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction
algorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling
limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied
to synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering
density, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit
neural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a
set of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder
feeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified
degree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field,
which also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture
directional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model
predicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is
performed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform
intermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air
and underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms
of 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods.

### [301] [RadarLLM: Adapting Pretrained Large Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection with Preference-aware Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12089)
*Qiying Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RadarLLM is a novel fine-tuning framework that uses preference-aware loss to optimize LLMs for marine radar target detection, addressing overfitting in low SCR scenarios by selectively focusing on generalizable feature patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained LLMs show promise for wireless signal processing but suffer from overfitting when fine-tuned for marine target detection, especially in low signal-to-clutter ratio scenarios where models memorize noisy patterns instead of learning discriminative features.

Method: Introduces RadarLLM with a preference-aware loss function that selectively optimizes different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, guiding the model to focus on the most generalizable patterns rather than uniformly optimizing all tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed loss function significantly outperforms original methods, especially in challenging low SCR scenarios, and RadarLLM consistently beats state-of-the-art baselines across diverse detection scenarios with notable gains under limited training data.

Conclusion: The preference-aware loss framework effectively addresses overfitting in LLM fine-tuning for radar signal analysis, demonstrating superior performance in marine target detection tasks, particularly in difficult low SCR conditions and data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising
general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated
by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs
for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection
tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target
detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in
challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting
primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature
patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to
unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel
fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike
conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,
this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on
their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the
most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate
the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem
as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine
radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the
original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR
scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under
limited training data conditions.

TL;DR: A framework combining feature preprocessing with LLMs for radar signal analysis, using tokenization and patch selection to filter redundant segments, then fine-tuning only normalization layers for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DL methods struggle with redundant feature segments and model size constraints in radar echo signal analysis, requiring a more efficient approach.

Method: Tokenize radar sequence features, apply patch selection algorithm to filter uninformative segments, project selected patches into LLM-compatible embeddings, then fine-tune only normalization layers of pre-trained LLM.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests using measured datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-integrated framework effectively addresses redundancy and model constraints in radar signal analysis while reducing training burden and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional
patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However,
conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments,
and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we
propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language
models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features,
applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and
projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space
of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a
pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training
burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.

TL;DR: FuseCodec is a novel speech tokenization method that unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through cross-modal alignment and global supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance in speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural codecs focus on low-level acoustic features but overlook semantic and contextual cues in human speech, creating challenges in aligning and unifying these different representations.

Method: Three complementary techniques: (1) Latent Representation Fusion integrating semantic/contextual features into encoder latent space, (2) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision with pooled representations for temporal consistency, and (3) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision for fine-grained token-level alignment.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity.

Conclusion: FuseCodec demonstrates effective contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech processing and downstream tasks, with applications in zero-shot speech synthesis.

Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech
language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic
features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human
speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from
self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from
pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the
semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies
acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal
alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary
techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and
contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and
unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision,
supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted
representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and
(iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by
dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for
fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS,
demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.
Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech,
surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy,
perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight
the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for

TL;DR: This paper compares different spectral and rhythm feature representations for audio classification using deep convolutional neural networks, finding that mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs perform significantly better than other features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate which spectral and rhythm feature representations work best for audio classification tasks when using deep convolutional neural networks, as CNNs are widely used in computer vision but can also be applied to audio feature extraction.

Method: The researchers used a deep convolutional neural network to test various feature representations including mel-scaled spectrograms, MFCCs, cyclic tempograms, STFT chromagrams, CQT chromagrams, and CENS chromagrams. Experiments were conducted using the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings.

Result: Mel-scaled spectrograms and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) performed significantly better than the other spectral and rhythm features for audio classification using deep CNNs.

Conclusion: For audio classification tasks with deep convolutional neural networks, mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs are the most effective feature representations among the various spectral and rhythm features tested.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision. They
can be used not only for conventional digital image material to recognize
patterns, but also for feature extraction from digital imagery representing
spectral and rhythm features extracted from time-domain digital audio signals
for the acoustic classification of sounds. Different spectral and rhythm
feature representations like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams are investigated in terms of the audio
classification performance using a deep convolutional neural network. It can be
clearly shown that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better than the other spectral and
rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks
using deep CNNs. The experiments were carried out with the aid of the ESC-50

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: First information-theoretic limits for multimodal retrieval with rate-distortion analysis, showing optimal performance requires modality-balanced encoding plus entropy skew penalty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish fundamental limits on how many bits are needed for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide principled guidance for retrieval system design.

Method: Casting ranking as lossy source coding, derived rate-distortion function R(D) for reciprocal-rank distortion, constructed entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with adaptive per-modality temperature decoder.

Result: Achieves distortion within O(n^{-1}) of theoretical optimum R(D) using n training triples. Experiments show adaptive codes within 2 percentage points of theoretical frontier, outperforming fixed-temperature and CLIP baselines.

Conclusion: Provides first information-theoretic foundation for multimodal retrieval with practical design guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.

Abstract: We establish the first information-theoretic limits for multimodal retrieval.
Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter
rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a
converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty
$\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We
then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an
adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows
this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training
triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound
whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the
entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm
that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical
frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly.
Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per
query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design
guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning
retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.
