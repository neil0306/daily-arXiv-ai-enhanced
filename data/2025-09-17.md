### [1] [MTEB-NL and E5-NL: Embedding Benchmark and Models for Dutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12340)
*Nikolay Banar,Ehsan Lotfi,Jens Van Nooten,Cristina Arhiliuc,Marija Kliocaite,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: New resources for Dutch embeddings: MTEB-NL benchmark, training dataset with synthetic data, and efficient E5-NL models released to address Dutch language underrepresentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dutch language is underrepresented in multilingual embedding resources, typically comprising only a small fraction of available resources, creating a gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Created MTEB-NL benchmark with existing and new Dutch datasets, compiled training data from Dutch retrieval datasets with synthetic LLM-generated data, and developed compact E5-NL embedding models.

Result: Developed comprehensive evaluation benchmark, expanded training data coverage beyond retrieval tasks, and created efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: The released resources (benchmark, training data, and models) address the Dutch language gap and support further development of Dutch embeddings, available publicly through Hugging Face Hub and MTEB package.

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

### [2] [MORABLES: A Benchmark for Assessing Abstract Moral Reasoning in LLMs with Fables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371)
*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES is a human-verified benchmark using fables and short stories to test LLMs' moral reasoning through multiple-choice questions with carefully designed distractors and adversarial variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs excel at standard reading comprehension, there's a need to evaluate their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and moral inference, which literature-based benchmarks can provide.

Method: Created MORABLES benchmark from historical fables and stories with multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, plus adversarial variants to test model robustness and identify vulnerabilities.

Result: Larger models outperform smaller ones but remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation, relying on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning, with 20% self-contradiction rates. Reasoning-enhanced models don't bridge this gap.

Conclusion: Scale, not reasoning ability, is the primary driver of performance in moral reasoning tasks, and current LLMs show significant brittleness in moral inference despite their size.

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Judge: Rapid Evaluation of Legal Document Recommendation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12382)
*Anu Pradhan,Alexandra Ortan,Apurv Verma,Madhavan Seshadri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using LLMs as judges to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal contexts, finding that Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation are better reliability metrics than traditional ones, and proposes statistical methods for robust system comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics fall short in capturing nuanced quality dimensions for AI-generated recommendations in high-stakes legal domains, creating an evaluation bottleneck that needs scalable solutions.

Method: Systematic experimentation comparing different inter-rater reliability metrics (Krippendorff's alpha, Gwet's AC2, rank correlation) and statistical tests (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections) for LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation.

Result: Traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in skewed distributions, while Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge selection and reliable system comparisons.

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge provides a scalable, cost-effective evaluation framework for legal AI systems that maintains statistical rigor and precision, transforming human-intensive evaluation into automated yet principled assessment.

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

### [4] [SENTRA: Selected-Next-Token Transformer for LLM Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12385)
*Mitchell Plyler,Yilun Zhang,Alexander Tuzhilin,Saoud Khalifah,Sen Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SENTRA is a novel Transformer-based detector that uses selected-next-token probabilities and contrastive pre-training to identify LLM-generated text, outperforming existing methods in out-of-domain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more capable and widespread, the potential for misuse grows, creating a need for effective detection of undisclosed LLM-generated text.

Method: SENTRA is a supervised Transformer-based encoder that leverages selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizes contrastive pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets across 24 text domains show SENTRA significantly outperforms popular baselines in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: SENTRA proves to be an effective general-purpose classifier for detecting LLM-generated text, particularly demonstrating strong performance in challenging out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

### [5] [MORQA: Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Medical Open-Ended Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12405)
*Wen-wai Yim,Asma Ben Abacha,Zixuan Yu,Robert Doerning,Fei Xia,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORQA is a new multilingual benchmark for evaluating NLG systems in medical QA, featuring multiple expert-authored gold answers and human ratings. LLM-based evaluators like GPT-4 outperform traditional metrics in correlating with expert judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automatic evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) are inadequate for medical NLG evaluation due to the critical need for accuracy, relevance, and domain expertise, especially in open-ended medical QA tasks with multiple valid responses.

Method: Created MORQA benchmark with 2-4+ gold-standard answers by medical professionals across three medical visual/text QA datasets in English and Chinese. Compared traditional metrics against LLM-based evaluators (GPT-4, Gemini) using expert human ratings as ground truth.

Result: LLM-based approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with expert judgments. LLMs show better sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability among reference answers.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive multilingual study showing LLM-based evaluators are superior for medical NLG evaluation. The work highlights the need for human-aligned evaluation methods in medical domain. All datasets and annotations will be publicly released.

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

### [6] [MedFact: Benchmarking the Fact-Checking Capabilities of Large Language Models on Chinese Medical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12440)
*Jiayi He,Yangmin Huang,Qianyun Du,Xiangying Zhou,Zhiyang He,Jiaxue Hu,Xiaodong Tao,Lixian Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedFact is a new Chinese medical fact-checking benchmark with 2,116 expert-annotated instances across 13 specialties, showing LLMs struggle with precise error localization and exhibit 'over-criticism' tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too narrow to capture real-world medical complexity, creating a critical gap in evaluating LLM factual reliability for healthcare applications.

Method: Hybrid AI-human framework with iterative expert feedback to refine multi-criteria filtering, creating diverse instances across specialties, error types, writing styles, and difficulty levels.

Result: LLMs can detect errors but struggle with precise localization; top models fall short of human performance; advanced reasoning techniques exacerbate 'over-criticism' of correct information.

Conclusion: MedFact highlights critical challenges for medical LLM deployment and provides a robust resource for developing more factually reliable, medically aware models.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

### [7] [Topic Coverage-based Demonstration Retrieval for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12451)
*Wonbin Kweon,SeongKu Kang,Runchu Tian,Pengcheng Jiang,Jiawei Han,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopicK is a topic coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both test inputs and the model's knowledge gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for in-context learning often retrieve demonstrations based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in irrelevant or redundant examples that don't adequately cover the fine-grained knowledge requirements needed for effective learning.

Method: TopicK estimates topics required by the input, assesses the model's knowledge on those topics, and iteratively selects demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics where the model exhibits low topical knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and closed-source LLMs validate the effectiveness of TopicK.

Conclusion: TopicK provides an effective framework for selecting demonstrations that comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge requirements, improving in-context learning performance.

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

### [8] [Does Language Model Understand Language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12459)
*Suvojit Acharjee,Utathya Aich,Asfak Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of SOTA language models on fine-grained linguistic phenomena (tense, negation, voice, modality) using new LUCID dataset and RECISE guidelines, with Compound-Beta emerging as the most balanced performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMs struggle with fine-grained linguistic phenomena critical for human communication, especially in educational contexts under UN SDG 4 where linguistic clarity is essential for tutoring systems, grading, and translation applications.

Method: Introduced LUCID dataset with carefully crafted sentence pairs in English and Bengali, evaluated SOTA models using standard metrics (Pearson/Spearman correlation, MAE) and novel HCE accuracy metric that measures alignment with human rating tolerance.

Result: Compound-Beta performed best, achieving highest Pearson correlation in English and robust performance on mixed-language data, showing strong alignment with human judgments in cross-lingual scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of evaluating LMs on fine-grained linguistic phenomena and introduces effective evaluation frameworks, with Compound-Beta showing the most human-like language interpretation capabilities.

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

### [9] [Audited Reasoning Refinement: Fine-Tuning Language Models via LLM-Guided Step-Wise Evaluation and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12476)
*Sumanta Bhattacharyya,Sara Riaz,Pedram Rooshenas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2tA is a method that refines LLM reasoning traces to create supervision for training task-specific reasoning models when human labels are scarce, using a two-stage alignment process with SFT and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training task-specific reasoning models is challenging when direct human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce, but LLMs produce abundant reasoning traces that can be refined into effective supervision.

Method: Generate initial reasoning from base model, refine traces to fix hallucinations, then perform two-stage alignment: supervised fine-tuning followed by direct preference optimization to calibrate intermediate reasoning with human preferences.

Result: Applied to EERD evaluation in database design, R2tA effectively handles structurally complex tasks where prompt-only methods fail, using a curated dataset of 600 EERD variants with induced mistakes across 11 categories.

Conclusion: R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path for scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and other applications.

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FunAudio-ASR is a large-scale LLM-based speech recognition system that combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance while addressing LLM hallucination issues for practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based ASR systems suffer from hallucination problems that degrade user experience in real-world applications, and they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets despite strong benchmark performance.

Method: Combines massive data scaling, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning. Specifically optimized for practical deployment with streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and other real-world requirements.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on real application datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in practical settings while overcoming the hallucination issues common in LLM-based ASR systems.

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR successfully addresses the practical deployment challenges of LLM-based ASR systems through production-oriented optimizations, making it suitable for diverse and complex real-world speech recognition scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

*Chiara Bonfanti,Michele Colombino,Giulia Coucourde,Faeze Memari,Stefano Pinardi,Rosa Meo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of three transformer-based pipelines for French-to-Bambara machine translation, with simple transformer achieving best results on low-resource language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective machine translation systems for Bambara, a low-resource African language spoken by about 14 million people, by comparing different training approaches.

Method: Three pipelines: 1) Simple transformer trained from scratch, 2) Fine-tuning LLaMA3 instructor models (3B-8B), 3) Language distillation with student-teacher architecture using LaBSE embeddings and BERT extension.

Result: First pipeline (simple transformer) achieved best results: 10% BLEU and 21% chrF on Bayelemagaba, and 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF on Yiri dataset. Instructor models performed better on single datasets than aggregated collections.

Conclusion: Simple transformer architecture outperformed more complex approaches for low-resource Bambara translation, consistent with findings in other low-resource language scenarios. Instructor models show dataset-specific pattern capture.

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

*Vijay Govindarajan,Pratik Patel,Sahil Tripathi,Md Azizul Hoque,Gautam Siddharth Kashyap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Zero-shot AAC system using pre-trained audio CLIP and LLM achieves 35% improvement in caption quality without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated Audio Captioning faces data limitations compared to image captioning, requiring a solution that doesn't need large training datasets.

Method: Uses pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract features and create structured prompts for LLM caption generation, with MAGIC search refinement instead of greedy decoding.

Result: 35% improvement in NLG mean score (4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with WavCaps model. Performance depends on audio-text matching and keyword selection.

Conclusion: Zero-shot approach with pre-trained models effectively addresses AAC data limitations, with keyword prompts being crucial for optimal performance.

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

### [13] [EconProver: Towards More Economical Test-Time Scaling for Automated Theorem Proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12603)
*Mukai Li,Linfeng Song,Zhenwen Liang,Jiahao Xu,Shansan Gong,Qi Liu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EconProver reduces computational costs of ATP models by 88% while maintaining performance through dynamic CoT switching and diverse parallel-scaled RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling strategies for ATP models (reflective CoT reasoning and increased sampling passes) introduce significant computational overhead, but existing cost analyses neglect the substantial cost disparities between different scaling approaches.

Method: Two complementary methods: (1) dynamic Chain-of-Thought switching mechanism to reduce unnecessary token consumption, and (2) diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes, integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline.

Result: Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet show EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight Automated Theorem Proving models without sacrificing performance, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements over current SOTA approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

Motivation: RoPE positional embeddings have intrinsic bias that restricts long-context modeling capabilities, and existing extension methods require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining.

Method: Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA) incorporates a learnable phase function into the attention mechanism to enable better long-range token interactions.

Result: TAPA extends to longer contexts with light fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and achieves significantly lower perplexity on long-context tasks compared to RoPE methods.

Conclusion: TAPA provides a superior positional encoding approach that overcomes RoPE's limitations for long-context modeling without requiring extensive post-training adjustments.

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

*Li Fu,Yu Xin,Sunlu Zeng,Lu Fan,Youzheng Wu,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAC framework improves ASR by better modeling pronunciation and distinguishing homophones through two-stage learning with grapheme-phoneme context modeling and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address key challenges in LLM-based ASR systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust homophone discrimination for better raw/long-tail word recognition.

Method: Two-stage learning: 1) Pronunciation-guided context learning with interleaved grapheme-phoneme modeling and distractors, 2) Pronunciation-discriminative reinforcement learning with perturbed label sampling.

Result: 30.2-53.8% relative WER reduction vs pre-trained LLM-based ASR models; 31.8-60.5% relative reduction in biased WER for long-tail words on English and Mandarin datasets.

Conclusion: PAC framework effectively enhances pronunciation awareness and homophone discrimination in ASR systems, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

### [16] [Don't Change My View: Ideological Bias Auditing in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12652)
*Paul Kröger,Emilio Barkett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for detecting ideological steering in large language models by analyzing distributional shifts in outputs across related prompts, enabling black-box auditing of proprietary systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs influence public opinion, there's a risk that those controlling these systems could steer them toward specific ideological positions, potentially gaining disproportionate influence over public discourse.

Method: Adapts a statistical method for ideological bias auditing that analyzes distributional shifts in model outputs across thematically related prompts, requiring no access to model internals (model-agnostic).

Result: The approach was validated through experiments demonstrating practical applicability and potential for supporting independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

Conclusion: This method provides a crucial first step for detecting ideological steering attempts in LLMs, particularly valuable for auditing proprietary black-box systems where internal access is limited.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

*Yougen Zhou,Qin Chen,Ningning Zhou,Jie Zhou,Xingjiao Wu,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses LLMs' preference bias in emotional support conversation strategy planning by identifying knowledge boundaries and using reinforcement learning with dual rewards to improve accuracy and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in emotional support conversations due to low accuracy in strategy planning and significant preference bias towards specific strategies, with underlying causes not well studied.

Method: First identify knowledge boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning, then propose reinforcement learning approach with dual reward function that optimizes both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for different knowledge regions.

Result: Experiments on ESCov and ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show the approach outperforms baselines, confirming effectiveness in reducing bias and improving strategy planning.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates preference bias in LLMs for emotional support conversations by addressing knowledge boundaries through dual-reward reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Zequn Xie,Chuxin Wang,Sihang Cai,Yeqiang Wang,Shulei Wang,Tao Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel annotation-free framework for text-based person search using multi-turn dialogue with MLLMs to generate pseudo-labels and refine queries, eliminating manual text annotations while improving retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual text annotations for person search are labor-intensive and limit scalability. Real-world queries are often vague or ambiguous, requiring better handling of incomplete descriptions without relying on expensive human labeling.

Method: Two complementary modules: MTG generates diverse pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, and MTI refines user queries at inference time using dynamic dialogue-based reasoning to handle ambiguous descriptions.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior retrieval accuracy while eliminating manual caption requirements. Demonstrates improved robustness and usability in real-world search scenarios.

Conclusion: The unified annotation-free framework enables scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems by leveraging MLLM-generated pseudo-labels and dynamic query refinement, overcoming manual annotation bottlenecks.

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

### [19] [Towards Inclusive Toxic Content Moderation: Addressing Vulnerabilities to Adversarial Attacks in Toxicity Classifiers Tackling LLM-generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12672)
*Shaz Furniturewala,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using mechanistic interpretability to identify and suppress vulnerable circuits in toxicity classifiers, improving robustness against adversarial attacks on LLM-generated content while revealing demographic-specific vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated content poses new challenges for content moderation as conventional toxicity classifiers trained on human text suffer from misclassifications due to distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. Current defenses are reactive rather than proactive.

Method: Used mechanistic interpretability techniques on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa classifiers. Employed adversarial attacking to identify vulnerable circuits, then suppressed these circuits to improve robustness. Tested on diverse datasets covering various minority groups.

Result: Found distinct heads that are either crucial for performance or vulnerable to attack. Suppressing vulnerable heads improved performance on adversarial input. Discovered different heads responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups.

Conclusion: The approach improves adversarial robustness and reveals fairness gaps in model training, providing insights for more inclusive development of toxicity detection models through demographic-level analysis of vulnerable circuits.

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

*Hiroyuki Deguchi,Masaaki Nagata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CBDT decoding improves text generation quality by combining case-based examples with MBR decoding, outperforming both MAP and standard MBR methods across translation and captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR decoding depends on samples from the model and struggles with out-of-domain knowledge. CBDT decoding addresses this limitation by using domain-specific examples to better estimate expected utility.

Method: Proposed case-based decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding that estimates expected utility using examples of domain data, and combines it with MBR decoding.

Result: CBDT decoding outperforms MAP decoding, and the combination of MBR+CBDT beats standard MBR in 7 domain translation tasks (De-En, Ja-En) and image captioning tasks (MSCOCO, nocaps).

Conclusion: CBDT decoding effectively handles out-of-domain knowledge issues and generates higher-quality text when combined with MBR decoding across multiple domains and tasks.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HistoryBank is a multilingual database of 10M+ historical events from Wikipedia, with a comprehensive QA benchmark for temporal reasoning across 6 tasks and 10 languages, evaluating popular LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal reasoning datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage, and focus more on contemporary events rather than historical depth.

Method: Extracted 10M+ historical events from Wikipedia timeline pages and article infoboxes across 10 languages, then constructed a comprehensive QA benchmark covering 6 temporal reasoning tasks.

Result: GPT4o performed best across all answer types and languages; Gemma-2 outperformed other small language models. The database provides unprecedented historical depth and linguistic breadth.

Conclusion: HistoryBank provides a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events, with code and datasets to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

*Omri Suissa,Muhiim Ali,Shengmai Chen,Yinuo Cai,Shekhar Pradhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLEAR GLASS model with novel contrastive loss for concept abstraction in VLMs, using MAGIC dataset to encode higher-level conceptual information without explicit concept exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can recognize images as instances of general concepts beyond object identification, but current VLMs lack this concept abstraction capacity. The research aims to enhance VLM's ability to understand higher-level conceptual information in images.

Method: Created MAGIC dataset with grouped image-caption pairs and conceptual labels. Developed novel contrastive loss with outer (text-image contrastive groups) and inner (distances between group instances) components to force semantic representation alignment with higher concepts.

Result: The CLEAR GLASS model demonstrates improved abstract concept recognition compared to state-of-the-art models, showing concept abstraction as an emergent capacity without explicit concept training.

Conclusion: The proposed training methodology successfully enables VLMs to develop concept abstraction capabilities by forcing semantic alignment with higher-level concepts through contrastive learning, representing a significant advancement in visual-language understanding.

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A bottom-up framework for generating factual long-form documents by first retrieving and clustering knowledge, then generating outlines and content, reducing hallucinations and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing top-down methods suffer from disconnect between generated plans and available knowledge, leading to factual inaccuracies and fragmented content in long-form document generation.

Method: Retrieval-first for knowledge, clustering for structure approach: exhaustive iterative retrieval from knowledge base, unsupervised clustering to organize documents into knowledge clusters, then hierarchical outline generation and content creation guided by clusters.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines on both 14B and 32B parameter models, with unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios requiring high fidelity and structural coherence.

Conclusion: Presents an effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured long-form documents, enabling more robust LLM applications in high-stakes, knowledge-intensive domains with reduced hallucination risk.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

TL;DR: Arabic-language resources can support Maltese NLP through cross-lingual augmentation techniques including novel transliteration systems and machine translation approaches, significantly benefiting Maltese NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maltese is a unique Semitic language with Latin-based orthography that creates a gap from its Arabic linguistic relatives, making it challenging for NLP despite shared roots.

Method: Multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes, novel transliteration systems that better represent Maltese orthography, and machine translation approaches.

Result: Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks, as demonstrated through evaluation on monolingual and multilingual models.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual augmentation using Arabic resources is effective for Maltese NLP, with novel transliteration systems providing better orthographic representation and improved performance.

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of multimedia content requires effective M2E2 systems, but the utility of LVLMs in this task remains underexplored despite their strong cross-modal capabilities.

Method: Systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs (DeepSeek-VL2, Qwen-VL series) on M2E2 dataset covering text-only, image-only, and cross-media subtasks under few-shot prompting and fine-tuning settings with LoRA.

Result: Few-shot LVLMs perform better on visual tasks but struggle with textual tasks; fine-tuning with LoRA substantially enhances performance; LVLMs show strong synergy when combining modalities in cross-modal settings.

Conclusion: LVLMs show promise for M2E2 but face persistent challenges in semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal grounding that need to be addressed for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

*Yubo Zhu,Dongrui Liu,Zecheng Lin,Wei Tong,Sheng Zhong,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating question difficulty for LLMs using only hidden representations without output generation, achieving better performance than existing approaches and enabling more efficient adaptive inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing difficulty estimation methods for LLMs require repeated sampling, auxiliary models, or fine-tuning, which are computationally expensive and may compromise generality. There's a need for efficient and accurate difficulty estimation that doesn't require generating output tokens.

Method: Model the token-level generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate expected output quality given any hidden state. Uses only the initial hidden state representations from the target LLM without generating any output tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments across textual and multimodal tasks show the method consistently outperforms existing baselines in difficulty estimation. When applied to adaptive reasoning strategies (Self-Consistency, Best-of-N, Self-Refine), it achieves higher inference efficiency with fewer generated tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient and accurate way to estimate question difficulty for LLMs using only hidden representations, enabling more efficient adaptive inference strategies without the computational costs of existing methods.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LLM fine-tuning approaches using LoRA are limited by data and training gaps between LLMs and embedding models, particularly in multilingual contexts and different masking strategies.

Method: Trained from scratch with added news data and multilingual pairs, introduced cross-lingual retrieval dataset, soft-masking mechanism to transition between causal and bidirectional masks, and dynamic hard negative mining for better negative examples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese MTEB with only 1.4B parameters.

Conclusion: Training LLMs from scratch specifically for embedding tasks with appropriate data augmentation and training techniques can overcome limitations of fine-tuning approaches and deliver superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

Conclusion: Provides a validated technical framework for automated workflow generation and offers a process-oriented perspective for investigating evolving scientific paradigms, with available source code and data for reproducibility.

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

### [30] [Investigating ReLoRA: Effects on the Learning Dynamics of Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12960)
*Yuval Weiss,David Demitri Africa,Paula Buttery,Richard Diehl Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReLoRA performs worse than standard training for small language models (11M-66M parameters) across multiple metrics, with performance gaps widening for larger models. The method reinforces rank deficiencies in smaller models, suggesting low-rank update strategies don't transfer well to SLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study ReLoRA's effectiveness in small language model pretraining, as parameter-efficient methods like LoRA have revolutionized fine-tuning but their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less understood for SLMs which offer lower computational costs.

Method: Conducted ablation experiments on SLMs (11M-66M parameters) evaluating performance on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP metrics, and analyzed learning dynamics to understand how ReLoRA affects model training.

Result: ReLoRA generally underperforms standard training across all evaluated metrics, with performance gaps increasing for larger models. Analysis shows ReLoRA reinforces rank deficiencies in smaller models.

Conclusion: Low-rank update strategies like ReLoRA may not transfer effectively to SLM pretraining, indicating the need for more research in low-compute regimes to develop suitable parameter-efficient pretraining methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

*Chenye Zou,Xingyue Wen,Tianyi Hu,Qian Janice Wang,Daniel Hershcovich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces cross-cultural wine review adaptation, creating a parallel corpus and showing current LLMs struggle with cultural nuances in translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting wine reviews across Chinese and English cultures, going beyond literal translation to incorporate regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor descriptors.

Method: Compiled a parallel corpus of 8k Chinese and 16k English wine reviews, benchmarked neural machine translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs using automatic metrics and human evaluation with three culture-oriented criteria.

Result: Current models struggle to capture cultural nuances, particularly in translating wine descriptions across different cultures, revealing limitations in handling cultural content.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant challenges in cross-cultural adaptation and the need for improved models that can better handle cultural nuances in translation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

*Jian Gao,Fufangchen Zhao,Yiyang Zhang,Danfeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SitLLM is a lightweight multimodal framework that combines pressure sensing with LLMs for fine-grained sitting posture monitoring and personalized health feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sitting posture monitoring systems suffer from coarse-grained recognition and lack semantic expressiveness needed for personalized feedback.

Method: Three key components: Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module for robust feature extraction, Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module to map sensor data to LLM semantic space, and Multi-Context Prompt Module that fuses multiple contextual information levels.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract (paper likely presents experimental results showing improved posture recognition and feedback generation).

Conclusion: SitLLM enables fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented response generation through multimodal integration of pressure sensing and LLMs.

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

*Nolan Platt,Pragyansmita Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using LLMs as teachers to generate synthetic maritime Q&A data enables 261x cost reduction while achieving 75% accuracy with smaller fine-tuned models instead of expensive larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with specialized domains due to scarce training data, and direct inference with large models is prohibitively expensive for maritime intelligence applications.

Method: Transform 3.2 billion AIS vessel records into 21,543 synthetic Q&A pairs using multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), then fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B model on this synthetic data.

Result: Achieved 75% accuracy on maritime tasks with 261x cost reduction compared to using larger models directly for inference.

Conclusion: Smaller models fine-tuned on synthetic data can match larger model performance at dramatically lower cost, providing a reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

*Francesco Pappone,Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni,Federico Califano,Niccolò Gentile,Roberto Marras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using a small encoder transformer as semantic reward model within GRPO framework improves LLM explanation quality for medical exams by providing dense semantic rewards based on cosine similarity to ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL techniques for LLM alignment rely on slow LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or brittle keyword metrics like ROUGE that fail to capture semantic quality of explanations.

Method: Proposed GRPO framework with small encoder-only transformer as semantic reward model, using cosine similarity between generated explanations and ground-truth references to provide dense reward signals.

Result: Significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over strong SFT baseline for Italian medical-school entrance examinations after domain-adaptive CPT and SFT.

Conclusion: Lightweight encoder models are effective for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks, providing semantically rich guidance beyond factual correctness.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

*Sijia Cui,Shuai Xu,Aiyao He,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAP framework combines LLM-based planning with parameterized skills to improve agent grounding in long-horizon environments, achieving strong performance in MicroRTS game benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents struggle with reliable low-level action generation and require expert experience for high-level task translation in complex adversarial environments.

Method: Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) framework with three components: skill library of parameterized skills, LLM-powered skill planner, and skill executor that converts skills to executable actions.

Result: GPT-4o-driven PLAP outperformed 80% of baseline agents in zero-shot setting, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP with few-shot examples surpassed top-tier scripted agent CoacAI in MicroRTS.

Conclusion: PLAP effectively addresses LLM grounding challenges in long-horizon environments and provides a comprehensive evaluation framework with released leaderboard for skill planning ability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

*Jinxin Li,Gang Tu,ShengYu Cheng,Junjie Hu,Jinting Wang,Rui Chen,Zhilong Zhou,Dongbo Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD is a novel hallucination detection framework that analyzes temporal dynamics of hidden representations using frequency-domain analysis, achieving over 10% improvement on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods are limited - factuality checking depends on external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis fails to capture reasoning dynamics, limiting effectiveness and robustness.

Method: HSAD models temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation by sampling activations across layers, applying FFT for frequency-domain analysis, and extracting strongest non-DC frequency components as spectral features. It identifies optimal observation points leveraging LLMs' autoregressive nature.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

### [37] [The Few-shot Dilemma: Over-prompting Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13196)
*Yongjian Tang,Doruk Tuncel,Christian Koerner,Thomas Runkler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Over-prompting degrades LLM performance when too many examples are used. Optimal few-shot example quantities vary by model, with TF-IDF selection achieving best results for requirement classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the over-prompting phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts diminish LLM performance, challenging conventional few-shot learning wisdom.

Method: Used three few-shot selection methods (random sampling, semantic embedding, TF-IDF) across multiple LLMs. Gradually increased example quantities to find optimal numbers for each model using software requirement datasets.

Result: Excessive domain-specific examples paradoxically degrade performance in some LLMs. TF-IDF selection with stratified examples achieved superior performance with fewer examples, surpassing state-of-the-art by 1% in requirement classification.

Conclusion: Optimal few-shot example quantity varies by LLM, and careful selection (TF-IDF + stratification) can avoid over-prompting while improving performance over conventional approaches.

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

*Jianfeng Zhu,Julina Maharjan,Xinyu Li,Karin G. Coifman,Ruoming Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show limited ability to accurately infer human personality traits from conversations, with correlations below 0.26 across various methods including prompting, fine-tuning, and embedding-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in psychological roles but their ability to interpret human personality traits from natural conversations remains unexplored, particularly with continuous ground-truth assessments.

Method: Created benchmark with interview transcripts and validated Big Five scores. Evaluated three approaches: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA fine-tuning of RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA, (3) regression using BERT and OpenAI embeddings.

Result: All Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remained below 0.26. Chain-of-thought provided minimal improvement over zero-shot, indicating personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limited alignment with validated psychological constructs, highlighting challenges in modeling complex human attributes. Future work should focus on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ChartGaze introduces an eye-tracking dataset to capture human gaze patterns during chart reasoning, showing LVLMs often diverge from human attention. A gaze-guided attention refinement method improves accuracy and attention alignment by up to 2.56 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models struggle with chart question answering, particularly by attending to irrelevant chart regions, which reduces interpretability and accuracy compared to human reasoning patterns.

Method: Created ChartGaze eye-tracking dataset capturing human gaze during chart reasoning tasks, then proposed gaze-guided attention refinement to align model image-text attention with human fixations.

Result: The gaze-guided approach improved both answer accuracy and attention alignment, achieving gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple LVLM models.

Conclusion: Incorporating human gaze patterns enhances both reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs, demonstrating the promise of human attention alignment for improving visual reasoning models.

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 6 challenging benchmarks, surpassing frontier proprietary systems. Training data significantly enhances tool-use capabilities even for traditional methods, and enables concurrent multi-agent exploration through parallel thinking.

Conclusion: The WebResearcher framework successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates superior performance in autonomous knowledge discovery and synthesis, with scalable parallel capabilities for comprehensive research.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary

TL;DR: The paper proposes Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) to build powerful agentic foundation models, addressing optimization tensions in post-training approaches. They develop AgentFounder-30B which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training approaches on general-purpose foundation models underperform in agentic tasks due to optimization tensions from simultaneously learning diverse agentic behaviors and aligning to expert demonstrations.

Method: Incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the deep research agents training pipeline to build agentic foundational models.

Result: AgentFounder-30B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 benchmarks: 39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE, while retaining strong tool-use ability.

Conclusion: Agentic CPT effectively addresses optimization tensions in building agentic foundation models, enabling superior performance in agentic tasks compared to post-training approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

TL;DR: AgentScaler framework scales up simulated environments to train LLMs for robust function-calling capabilities, using automated environment construction and two-phase fine-tuning to significantly improve agent performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require LLMs to have precise function-calling intelligence, which depends on training in diverse environments. Current limitations in environment diversity hinder the development of robust agentic capabilities.

Method: Automated construction of heterogeneous simulated environments to broaden function-calling scenarios, plus two-phase agent fine-tuning: first building fundamental capabilities, then domain-specific specialization.

Result: Extensive experiments on tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench show AgentScaler significantly enhances function-calling capability of models compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Scaling environments through systematic simulation and targeted fine-tuning is an effective approach for advancing general agentic intelligence and function-calling capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

TL;DR: WebWeaver introduces a dual-agent framework that iteratively plans and writes research reports, addressing limitations of static pipelines and one-shot generation by emulating human research processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches for open-ended deep research suffer from static pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition, and one-shot generation paradigms that lead to long-context failures and hallucinations.

Method: A dual-agent framework with a planner that iteratively interleaves evidence acquisition with outline optimization, and a writer that performs hierarchical retrieval and section-by-section writing using targeted evidence from a memory bank.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art across major OEDR benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearchGym.

Conclusion: The human-centric, iterative methodology demonstrates that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured research reports.

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

*Xixi Wu,Kuan Li,Yida Zhao,Liwen Zhang,Litu Ou,Huifeng Yin,Zhongwang Zhang,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Minhao Cheng,Shuai Wang,Hong Cheng,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSum is a novel paradigm that enables indefinite web exploration through periodic context summarization, overcoming LLM context window limitations in complex search tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based web agents face context window constraints that limit their ability to handle complex queries requiring extensive search cycles with multiple entities and relationships.

Method: ReSum periodically converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states through summarization. ReSum-GRPO integrates GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to train agents for summary-conditioned reasoning.

Result: ReSum delivers 4.5% average improvement over ReAct, with up to 8.2% gains after ReSum-GRPO training. WebResummer-30B achieves 33.3% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3% on BrowseComp-en with only 1K training samples.

Conclusion: ReSum effectively overcomes context window limitations in web agents through summarization, enabling indefinite exploration and significantly outperforming existing approaches with minimal training data.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

*Millicent Li,Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo,Giordano Rogers,Naomi Saphra,Byron C. Wallace*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Activation verbalization methods using LLMs to interpret target model internals may not provide meaningful insights, as they often reflect the verbalizer's own knowledge rather than the target model's actual activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate whether current activation verbalization methods actually provide privileged knowledge about LLM internal workings or merely convey information about inputs.

Method: Evaluated popular verbalization methods across datasets from prior work, ran controlled experiments to test whether verbalizations reflect target model activations or verbalizer LLM's parametric knowledge.

Result: Verbalization methods succeeded at benchmarks without access to target model internals, and verbalizations often reflected the verbalizer LLM's knowledge rather than the target model's actual activations.

Conclusion: There is a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into LLM operations.

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel human-in-the-loop machine learning approach using U-Mamba achieves high accuracy in 3D anatomical segmentation and reconstruction from breast MRIs, with strong generalization across diverse datasets for improved surgical planning and patient education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation models struggle with generalization across diverse datasets for preoperative planning, requiring more accurate and generalizable algorithms for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond breast cancer applications.

Method: Processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation, co-registration and segmentation of breast structures, and 3D visualization using ITK-SNAP. Employed human-in-the-loop approach with U-Mamba architecture to refine segmentations for generalization across imaging scenarios.

Result: U-Mamba achieved DSC values of 0.97 (±0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 (±0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and 0.82 (±0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. Generated accurate 3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features. Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, navigation, and decision support.

Conclusion: The human-in-the-loop machine learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and anatomical segmentation, offering enhanced visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more effective patient education across medical applications.

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using convolutional neural networks to automatically segment microscopic images of irradiated TRISO nuclear fuel particles to reduce manual labor and improve objectivity in analyzing irradiation-induced morphological changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of thousands of TRISO particles in fuel compacts is cumbersome and subjective. There's a need to accelerate data analysis and reduce subjectivity in identifying irradiation-induced changes like kernel swelling and buffer densification.

Method: Generated a dataset of 2,000+ microscopic images of cross-sectional TRISO particles with annotations. Used various CNN architectures including RU-Net (newly developed), U-Net, ResNet, and Attention U-Net to automatically segment different TRISO layers.

Result: The RU-Net based model performed best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU) metric. CNN models can expedite analysis and significantly reduce manual labor while improving segmentation objectivity.

Conclusion: Convolutional neural networks provide an effective automated solution for TRISO particle analysis, offering faster processing, reduced subjectivity, and improved efficiency compared to manual microscopy methods.

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

TL;DR: A tiered pipeline using multispectral imaging and autoencoders for efficient nutrient anomaly detection and crop status estimation, balancing energy efficiency with accuracy for sustainable agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nutrient management approaches require lengthy analyses preventing real-time optimization, and imaging-based phenotyping is computationally intensive for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Hierarchical pipeline using autoencoder for early anomaly detection, comparing vegetation index features with Random Forest vs. raw whole-image Vision Transformer for detailed nutrient status estimation across three fertilizer treatments.

Result: 73% net detection of severely nutrient-deficient samples 9 days after transplanting at lower energy cost than wasted nitrogen; ViT outperformed RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R² 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35) but with higher energy consumption.

Conclusion: The modular pipeline enables edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability by providing flexible trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy in nutrient management.

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

Motivation: Humor understanding is a core aspect of social intelligence but remains a significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), highlighting the need for better evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics and conducted experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs to evaluate their performance on humor interpretation and narrative sequencing tasks.

Result: Top models achieved only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below human performance, revealing substantial gaps in multimodal integration and narrative reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Current LMMs have critical limitations in integrating visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor understanding, and PixelHumor provides a rigorous framework to drive development of more socially aware AI systems.

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

TL;DR: Proposes OnlineHOI framework for real-time human-object interaction tasks using Mamba architecture with memory mechanism, achieving SOTA results on online generation and perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI methods work offline using full sequence information, but real-world scenarios require online processing with only current and historical data available at each time step.

Method: OnlineHOI framework based on Mamba architecture with memory mechanism to handle streaming data and efficiently integrate historical information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, and online HOI4D perception task.

Conclusion: The proposed online approach significantly outperforms offline methods in real-time HOI scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of Mamba-based architecture with memory for streaming data processing.

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

Motivation: To examine the dual nature of deep learning technology - while it drives innovation in computer vision, its application in deepfake creation has produced significant negative societal impacts that need to be understood and addressed.

Method: The paper analyzes the development and applications of deepfake technology, focusing on how deep learning algorithms are used to create realistic counterfeit photographs and films that can bypass facial recognition systems and manipulate public perception.

Result: Deepfake technology has advanced to produce media that is indistinguishable from authentic content, enabling malicious applications including identity theft, reputation damage, election interference, and threats to national security through sophisticated face-swapping techniques.

Conclusion: The improper application of deepfake technology presents serious multifaceted risks to society, including threats to personal privacy, political stability, and national security, requiring urgent attention and countermeasures to mitigate these harmful effects.

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert

### [52] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the simplicity bias (SB) in CLIP models and its relationship with performance across various image classification tasks, proposing a new frequency-aware measure for better SB assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While simplicity bias is known to affect neural network generalization, existing measures are inadequate for large models like CLIP, and the relationship between SB and performance across different image classification tasks remains unclear.

Method: The authors propose a frequency-aware measure to capture finer-grained SB differences, validate it on CLIP models using SB-modulation methods, and examine SB-performance relationships across zero-shot and fine-tuning settings on various image classification tasks.

Result: The new measure proves more informative and consistent than previous methods. Experiments show varying behaviors - stronger SB correlates better with out-of-distribution generalization than adversarial robustness, indicating task-dependent benefits.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of aligning a model's inductive biases with target task characteristics, and provides a better tool for measuring simplicity bias in large vision-language models.

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm is a graph neural network framework that combines dermoscopic images with patient metadata and millimeter-scale calibration for improved melanoma classification, outperforming image-only AI approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image-only AI for dermoscopy ignores crucial patient metadata (age, sex, site) and physical scale information needed for geometric analysis, limiting classification performance.

Method: Uses U-Nets for lesion and ruler segmentation, regresses pixels-per-millimeter from ruler masks, computes real-scale geometric descriptors, and employs a spectral GNN with EfficientNet-B3 features and metadata/geometry-based edges for semi-supervised classification.

Result: Achieves AUC 0.9812 (vs 0.9440 baseline), with sparser graphs maintaining AUC 0.9788 using only 25% of edges. Ruler segmentation Dice 0.904, lesion segmentation Dice 0.908, scale regression MAE 1.5px.

Conclusion: Integrating calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in population graphs provides substantial improvements over image-only methods, with sparse graphs enabling efficient deployment while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces position-aware text image machine translation (PATIMT) that provides fine-grained, layout-preserving translations with bounding boxes, addressing limitations of current TIMT approaches that only translate all text without spatial information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIMT methods focus only on translating all text in images without providing bounding box locations and cover limited scenarios, which limits practical applications requiring precise spatial translation.

Method: The authors construct PATIMTBench benchmark with 10 diverse real-world scenarios, introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement Pipeline to select appropriate OCR tools, and fine-tune compact Large Vision-Language Models on their data.

Result: Fine-tuned compact LVLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on both region-specific translation and full-image translation with grounding tasks, demonstrating the scalability and generalizability of the training data.

Conclusion: The proposed PATIMT framework and benchmark successfully address the limitations of traditional TIMT by enabling fine-grained, layout-preserving translation with bounding boxes across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

*He Gao,Baoxiang Huang,Milena Radenkovic,Borui Li,Ge Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimMemDA framework for cross-modal ship wake detection using similarity-guided filtering and memory-guided adaptation to bridge optical-SAR domain gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images are crucial for wake detection but have abstract/noisy features, while optical images provide clearer visual cues but suffer from domain shift when applied to SAR data.

Method: Uses WakeGAN for style transfer to create SAR-like pseudo-images, instance-level feature similarity filtering to prioritize target-like samples, and Feature-Confidence Memory Bank with KNN fusion to calibrate pseudo-labels, plus region-mixed training.

Result: Experimental results show improved accuracy and robustness in cross-modal ship wake detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SimMemDA method effectively addresses cross-modal domain adaptation challenges for ship wake detection, demonstrating both effectiveness and feasibility.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with

### [56] [Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)
*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach called Amplifier Air-Transformer generates hourly 2km resolution air temperature data over the contiguous US by reconstructing cloud-obscured satellite surface temperatures and transforming them to air temperature using neural networks with physics guidance and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single data source provides seamless spatiotemporal air temperature data - weather stations offer continuous monitoring but limited spatial coverage, while satellites provide broad coverage but with gaps from cloud obscuration.

Method: Two-stage neural network approach: 1) Reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured by clouds using a neural network encoded with annual temperature cycle, linear amplification of ERA5 data, and convolutional layers for spatiotemporal variations. 2) Transforms reconstructed surface temperature to air temperature using another neural network leveraging relationships with Earth surface properties, enhanced with deep ensemble learning for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature pixels and 155 million air temperature records from US weather stations (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping accuracy of 1.93°C in station-based validation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction, can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless high-resolution temperature monitoring, and provides publicly available data and tools.

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study

*Anthony Miyaguchi,Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan,Charles R. Clark*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-hoc metric learning effectiveness depends heavily on backbone embedding quality and domain-specificity. Domain-specific MegaDescriptor outperformed general-purpose DINOv2 for animal re-identification, with minimal gains from metric learning on general-purpose features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the effectiveness of post-hoc metric learning depends on the initial quality and domain-specificity of backbone embeddings for animal re-identification tasks, and to compare general-purpose vs domain-specific models.

Method: Used DINOv2 (general-purpose) and MegaDescriptor (domain-specific) as backbone models with K-Nearest Neighbor classifier and robust thresholding. Applied triplet-learning projection head to improve performance and analyzed validation loss and qualitative visualizations.

Result: Triplet-learning improved MegaDescriptor by 0.13 points but only 0.03 for DINOv2 on averaged BAKS and BAUS metrics. General-purpose manifold proved difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks with stagnant validation loss.

Conclusion: General-purpose features have critical limitations for specialized, limited-data re-ID tasks. Domain-specific pre-training is crucial, as general-purpose manifolds are resistant to fine-grained reshaping through metric learning.

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

TL;DR: GhostNetV3-Small adaptation outperforms original GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10 (93.94% accuracy), while knowledge distillation techniques unexpectedly reduced performance compared to baseline training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have high computational demands unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices, requiring efficient model compression and adaptation strategies.

Method: Proposed GhostNetV3-Small variant optimized for low-resolution inputs (CIFAR-10) and evaluated knowledge distillation techniques including traditional distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles.

Result: GhostNetV3-Small achieved 93.94% accuracy on CIFAR-10, significantly outperforming original GhostNetV3. All distillation strategies reduced accuracy compared to baseline training.

Conclusion: Architectural adaptation is more impactful than distillation for small-scale image classification, highlighting need for better model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Raw UAV imagery outperforms orthomosaic imagery for palm tree detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests, with crown-center annotations further improving localization accuracy for ecological monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate individual tree mapping is essential for ecological monitoring and forest management, but orthomosaic imagery from UAVs has limitations including stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing that limit field deployment suitability.

Method: Used state-of-the-art detectors and keypoint models to compare detection performance between orthomosaic and raw UAV imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain transfer scenarios, and evaluated the impact of crown-center annotations versus bounding-box centroids.

Result: Raw imagery yields superior performance in deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations improves localization accuracy and provides precise tree positions.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring, recommending raw imagery with crown-center annotations for optimal tree detection and localization in tropical forest applications.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

*Mayank Patel,Rahul Jain,Asim Unmesh,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MechBench benchmark dataset and DYNAMO neural model for predicting coupled mechanical motion in gear assemblies from CAD geometry without joint annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for articulated objects rely on simplified kinematics or joint annotations, but mechanical assemblies like gears have motion arising from geometric coupling through meshing teeth, which current approaches cannot handle.

Method: Created MechBench dataset with 693 synthetic gear assemblies and ground-truth motion trajectories. Proposed DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that predicts SE(3) motion trajectories from segmented CAD point clouds.

Result: DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving accurate and temporally consistent motion predictions across varied gear configurations.

Conclusion: MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD assemblies, addressing the gap in reasoning about relational motion from geometry alone.

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet provides an accurate and efficient solution for in-field deployment, serving as a reliable basis for automated cotton harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis.

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield

representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future

Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for

TL;DR: This paper provides a meta-review of deep learning approaches and datasets for point cloud processing tasks like scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and modeling, focusing on their practical applications in urban and environmental contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys primarily focus on network architectures for unordered point clouds but ignore practical considerations like large data volumes, diverse scenes, varying point density, and data modality that are crucial for real-world applications.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive review of deep learning methods and datasets covering critical point cloud processing tasks, examining their application in urban and environmental contexts to identify practical implementation gaps.

Result: The review identifies significant gaps between theoretical deep learning approaches and their practical deployment in real-world point cloud processing applications, highlighting challenges in handling real-world data complexities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with insights on both algorithmic and practical aspects of surveyed methods, providing guidance for closing the gap between research and real-world implementation of point cloud processing technologies.

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for glaucoma prognosis that handles variable-length sequential data and small datasets through self-supervised learning and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing glaucoma prognosis methods have fixed-length input constraints and struggle with limited dataset sizes, requiring a more flexible and data-efficient approach.

Method: Two-Stage Decoupling Framework (TSDF): 1) Feature representation module using self-supervised learning to aggregate multiple datasets, 2) Temporal aggregation module with attention mechanism for variable-length sequential inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on OHTS and GRAPE datasets show the approach is effective and robust across different clinical settings and scales.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances glaucoma prognosis performance while maintaining compact parameter size and handling variable-length data efficiently.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage tokenizer training scheme (main-training with latent perturbation and post-training) to bridge the reconstruction-generation distribution gap in image generative models, achieving significant quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image tokenizers prioritize reconstruction but ignore generation errors during sampling, creating a discrepancy between reconstruction and generation distributions that harms generative model performance.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Main-training with latent perturbation strategy to simulate sampling noises and improve robustness 2) Post-training that optimizes the decoder with a well-trained generative model to mitigate distribution differences. Also introduces pFID evaluation metric.

Result: Achieved 1.60 gFID with main training alone and further improved to 1.36 gFID with post-training using a ~400M generator. Method validated across discrete/continuous tokenizers with autoregressive and diffusion generators.

Conclusion: The proposed tokenizer training scheme effectively bridges the reconstruction-generation gap, significantly boosting generation quality, convergence speed, and providing a reliable evaluation metric (pFID) that correlates tokenizer performance with generation quality.

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundational model called GRT (Generalizable Radar Transformer) is trained on the largest raw mmWave radar dataset (1M samples) to achieve high-quality 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation with single-chip radars, overcoming their poor angular resolution limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mmWave radars have poor angular resolution despite being robust and inexpensive, and there are no standardized foundational models or large datasets available for these sensors, forcing practitioners to train task-specific models from scratch with limited data.

Method: Collected 1M raw radar samples (29 hours) and trained a Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT) foundational model that processes raw radar data to predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation, with extensive ablation studies on design decisions.

Result: GRT achieves quality typically only possible with higher-resolution sensors, generalizes across diverse settings, shows logarithmic data scaling (20% improvement per 10x data), and raw data outperforms lossy representations equivalent to 10x more training data.

Conclusion: The GRT foundational model demonstrates the potential of single-chip mmWave radars when trained on large datasets, with estimates suggesting ≈100M samples (3000 hours) would fully exploit its capabilities.

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

Motivation: While VLMs excel in multimodal tasks, their robustness under noisy conditions remains poorly understood, necessitating systematic evaluation of their performance degradation under controlled perturbations.

Method: Developed evaluation framework using lexical metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures with sentence embeddings to assess semantic alignment across diverse datasets under controlled noise conditions.

Result: Key findings: (1) ground-truth caption quality significantly affects performance, (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but don't universally outperform smaller models, (3) JPEG compression and motion blur cause dramatic performance degradation across all models.

Conclusion: The study reveals nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, providing a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

TL;DR: IG-CAM is a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that uses instance guidance and influence functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps from image-level annotations only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSSS methods struggle with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most discriminative regions, requiring expensive pixel-level labeling. The goal is to achieve accurate segmentation without costly annotations.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Instance-Guided Refinement using ground truth masks for complete object coverage, 2) Influence Function Integration for robust feature representations, and 3) Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement for precise object boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 with 82.3% mIoU before post-processing and 86.6% after CRF refinement, significantly outperforming previous methods with superior localization accuracy and complete object coverage.

Conclusion: IG-CAM establishes a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive, with demonstrated robustness and generalization capability.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Motivation: Artist-created meshes are crucial for commercial graphics pipelines but existing approaches assume clean inputs or use complex multi-stage pipelines, limiting real-world applicability

Method: Proposes end-to-end method that refines input point cloud and directly produces high-quality meshes by reformulating 3D point cloud refinement as 2D inpainting task

Result: Preliminary results on ShapeNet dataset demonstrate promise in producing clean, complete meshes

Conclusion: Framework shows potential for generating artist-style meshes from real-world sensor data like LiDAR or RGB-D cameras

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stalk diameter measurement methods are labor-intensive, error-prone, and not scalable for high-throughput phenotyping needed in modern crop breeding programs.

Method: Geometry-aware computer vision pipeline integrating deep learning-based instance segmentation, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for robust diameter estimation.

Result: The approach mitigates effects of curvature, occlusion, and image noise to provide reliable stalk diameter measurements.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable and reliable solution for high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and agronomic research.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

*Can Peng,Yuyuan Liu,Yingyu Yang,Pramit Saha,Qianye Yang,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a federated learning method for multi-label classification using neural collapse theory and feature disentanglement to handle skewed label distributions across clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning performance degrades with decentralized heterogeneous data, especially in multi-label scenarios with complex label relationships. Existing FL research focuses on single-label classification, but real-world applications like medical imaging often involve multi-label data with skewed distributions.

Method: Uses neural collapse theory to align feature distributions across clients. Introduces feature disentanglement module to extract semantically specific features for multi-label settings. Employs predefined shared NC structure to guide clustering and regularization losses to encourage compact feature clustering.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings show the approach outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the challenging FL scenario of multi-label classification with skewed label distributions by leveraging neural collapse theory and feature disentanglement.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

TL;DR: Agent4FaceForgery uses LLM-powered agents to simulate human forgery creation processes and generate realistic training data with nuanced text-image consistency labels, improving face forgery detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between offline benchmarks and real-world face forgery detection efficacy caused by ecologically invalid training data that doesn't capture human intent and social media context.

Method: Multi-agent framework with LLM-powered agents equipped with profile and memory modules to simulate forgery creation in social environments, using Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) to ensure data quality and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance gains for detectors of multiple architectures, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in generating valuable training data.

Conclusion: The simulation-driven approach successfully addresses ecological validity issues in face forgery detection by modeling human intent and social context, providing a robust solution for real-world detection challenges.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

### [72] [Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554)
*Wenxuan Ji,Haichao Shi,Xiao-Yu zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGNM is a Graph Neural Network approach that explicitly models relational structures for Human-Object Interaction detection, outperforming Transformer methods and achieving state-of-the-art results on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer architectures don't explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, while GNNs are inherently better suited for capturing relationships between human-object pairs.

Method: Proposes a multimodal graph network framework with four-stage graph structure and multi-level feature interaction mechanism that leverages both vision and language features to enhance information propagation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks, shows significant performance gains with advanced object detectors, and maintains effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.

Conclusion: GNN-based relational modeling with multimodal features is more effective than Transformer approaches for HOI detection, demonstrating superior performance and better handling of class imbalance.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

### [73] [VQT-Light:Lightweight HDR Illumination Map Prediction with Richer Texture.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12556)
*Kunliang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQT-Light is a novel lighting estimation framework using VQVAE and ViT that treats illumination prediction as multiclass classification, achieving 40FPS speed with improved texture fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lighting estimation methods struggle with either restoring detailed illumination textures or maintaining fast running speeds while preserving texture fidelity.

Method: Combines VQVAE for discrete feature extraction to avoid posterior collapse, and ViT for capturing global context and dependencies to predict illumination outside field of view. Formulates lighting estimation as multiclass classification.

Result: Achieves 40FPS inference speed, improves multiple evaluation metrics, and produces light maps with richer texture and better fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VQT-Light demonstrates superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative experiments, offering a lightweight and fast solution for accurate lighting estimation with improved texture details.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [74] [Adaptive Sampling Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12569)
*Qi Wang,Shuliang Zhu,Jinjia Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler for consistency distillation that dynamically selects target timesteps, optimizes alternating sampling, and uses smoothing techniques to improve flexibility and performance across various distillation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consistency distillation methods rely on fixed timestep selection strategies that limit flexibility and require specialized schedulers for different distillation processes, restricting the full potential of diffusion models in practical applications.

Method: Develops an adaptive sampling scheduler with three strategies: (1) dynamic target timestep selection based on computed importance, (2) optimized alternating sampling along solution trajectory using time step importance, and (3) smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques for stable high-quality generation.

Result: Comprehensive experimental evaluations across various consistency distillation methods consistently demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance and strong adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive sampling scheduler effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods, providing enhanced flexibility and improved performance across different consistency distillation frameworks while maintaining stable high-quality generation results.

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

*Yizhen Lao,Yu Zhang,Ziting Wang,Chengbo Wang,Yifei Xue,Wanpeng Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR that targets LiDAR-based localization by removing critical keypoints through reverse-engineering, causing significant localization drift in both simulation and physical world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but there has been little exploration of attacks on LiDAR-based localization for self-driving cars, which poses serious security challenges.

Method: Reverse-engineer localization models to identify critical keypoints, strategically remove them to disrupt LiDAR-based localization, and validate using physical-world implementation with near-infrared absorptive materials.

Result: Removing Top-K keypoint regions significantly degrades registration accuracy in three state-of-the-art models (HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) and causes noticeable localization drift in Autoware platform. Physical-world attacks successfully replicated simulation results.

Conclusion: The DisorientLiDAR framework demonstrates effective adversarial attacks on LiDAR localization systems, showing veracity and generality across different models and real-world scenarios, highlighting serious security vulnerabilities in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

*Pengbo Guo,Chengxu Liu,Guoshuai Zhao,Xingsong Hou,Jialie Shen,Xueming Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel spectral learning approach for reflection removal using Spectral Codebook to reconstruct optical spectrum, enabling better reflection distinction through wavelength differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reflection removal methods work only in image domain and ignore spectral properties, limiting their ability to effectively discern reflections from transmission components.

Method: Proposes Spectral Codebook to reconstruct reflection image spectrum, two spectral prior refinement modules for spatial redistribution and spectral enhancement, and Spectrum-Aware Transformer for joint recovery in spectral and pixel domains.

Result: Superior performance and generalization ability demonstrated on three different reflection benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Spectral learning perspective effectively addresses reflection removal by leveraging wavelength differences in optical spectrum, outperforming existing image-domain only approaches.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

*Liming Lu,Shuchao Pang,Xu Zheng,Xiang Gu,Anan Du,Yunhuai Liu,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIARD proposes a cyclic iterative adversarial robustness distillation method that addresses performance degradation in clean examples by using multi-teacher framework with contrastive alignment and continuous adversarial retraining, achieving significant improvements in both robustness and clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial robustness distillation methods suffer from degraded performance on clean examples due to divergent optimization objectives between clean and robust teachers, and performance deterioration of robust teachers from iteratively generated adversarial examples.

Method: Proposes CIARD with: 1) multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve optimization conflicts, and 2) continuous adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against varying adversarial examples.

Result: Achieves average 3.53% improvement in adversarial defense rates across various attack scenarios and 5.87% increase in clean sample accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: CIARD establishes a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization, effectively addressing the trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean performance in knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

*Jinjie Shen,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Nan Pu,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAMM dataset and RamDG framework for detecting semantically-coordinated multimodal manipulations where visual edits are paired with consistent textual descriptions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks suffer from misalignment artifacts that poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns, where practical attacks maintain semantic consistency across modalities rather than creating easily detectable anomalies.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Construct SAMM dataset using state-of-the-art image manipulations with contextually-plausible textual narratives; 2) Propose RamDG framework that retrieves external knowledge and uses image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The work pioneers detection of semantically-coordinated manipulations and provides a more realistic benchmark and effective framework for multimodal manipulation detection and grounding.

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion (MFAF) method for cross-view geo-localization, using multi-frequency feature extraction and spatial attention to handle viewpoint variations and background noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods neglect spatial and semantic information while extracting features through feature map segmentation, leading to challenges with appearance variations across different viewpoints and difficulty in extracting discriminative features.

Method: MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) to capture low-frequency structural features and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales, and Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module to adaptively focus on key regions of frequency features.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance in both drone localization and drone navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MFAF method effectively addresses cross-view geo-localization challenges by improving feature consistency and robustness across viewpoints while mitigating background noise interference through frequency-aware attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

*Gordon Hung,Ivan Felipe Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s on underwater imagery, finding that accuracy saturates after YOLOv9 while inference speed improves significantly, with YOLOv10 offering the best speed-accuracy trade-off for AUV deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUVs need efficient computer vision for underwater tasks, but face challenges with light attenuation, turbidity, class imbalance, and limited computational resources. YOLO detectors are attractive but their performance in marine environments is unclear.

Method: Used two underwater datasets (Coral Disease and Fish Species) with varying training sizes. Trained four YOLO variants with identical hyperparameters and evaluated precision, recall, mAP metrics, inference time, and FPS. Used Grad-CAM for feature visualization.

Result: Accuracy saturates after YOLOv9 across both datasets. Inference speed improves significantly with newer versions. YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment.

Conclusion: Recent YOLO innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. YOLOv10 is optimal for AUVs. The study provides the first controlled comparison of YOLO variants on underwater imagery and delivers an open benchmark for marine-vision research.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based

trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under

*Wenzhuo Jin,Qianfeng Yang,Xianhao Wu,Hongming Chen,Pengpeng Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmokeBench dataset provides real-world paired smoke-free and smoke-degraded surveillance images for advancing image desmoking algorithms in early-stage fire scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes) suffer from smoke-obscured visibility in surveillance systems, impairing emergency response. Current smoke removal algorithms are limited by lack of large-scale real-world paired datasets.

Method: Created SmokeBench dataset containing precisely aligned image pairs captured under diverse scenes and smoke concentrations, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation of desmoking methods.

Result: Comprehensive experiments benchmarking various desmoking methods on the dataset demonstrate its value for advancing robust and practical image desmoking in real-world fire scenes.

Conclusion: SmokeBench provides a valuable foundation for image desmoking research and has been publicly released to support development of effective emergency response systems.

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

*Siju Ma,Changsiyu Gong,Xiaofeng Fan,Yong Ma,Chengjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIS-FUSION is a cascaded framework that unifies infrared-visible image fusion with referring image segmentation through joint optimization, using text guidance to enhance semantic alignment and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven infrared and visible image fusion methods lack goal-aligned tasks to supervise and evaluate how effectively input text contributes to fusion outcomes. The observation that referring image segmentation and text-driven fusion share the common objective of highlighting text-referred objects motivated this unified approach.

Method: Proposes RIS-FUSION framework with LangGatedFusion module that injects textual features into fusion backbone for semantic alignment. Introduces MM-RIS benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets (infrared-visible image pairs, segmentation masks, referring expressions) for multimodal referring image segmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments show RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded framework successfully unifies fusion and referring image segmentation through joint optimization, demonstrating significant performance improvements and providing a large-scale benchmark for multimodal referring tasks.

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

*Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Mingyu Liu,Qingsheng Wang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeFA (Debiased Feature Augmentation) is a novel approach for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that uses disentangle-and-reconstruct framework with debiasing to synthesize high-fidelity composition features, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in CZSL including entangled attributes/objects and long-tailed distributions in real-world data, inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and perception share similar neural processes.

Method: Integrates disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature augmentation with debiasing strategy to synthesize high-fidelity composition features using prior knowledge of seen attributes and objects.

Result: Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: DeFA effectively addresses CZSL challenges by leveraging neuroscientific inspiration to create debiased feature augmentation, achieving superior compositional generalization performance.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

*Heng Zhang,Haichuan Hu,Yaomin Shen,Weihao Yu,Yilei Yuan,Haochen You,Guo Cheng,Zijian Zhang,Lubin Gan,Huihui Wei,Hao Zhang,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE addresses asymmetry in vision-language MoE models by using specialized expert groups for modality-specific processing, cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to maintain contextual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE approaches struggle with the asymmetry between visual (spatially complete) and linguistic (sequential context) processing, causing language experts to lose contextual grounding and rely on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing multimodal information.

Method: Proposes AsyMoE with three specialized expert groups: intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases.

Result: Achieves 26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Conclusion: AsyMoE effectively addresses the modality asymmetry problem in vision-language models through specialized expert design, achieving significant performance improvements with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally observable environments, failing to capture challenges of long-horizon reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic changes.

Method: Introduces two dynamic spatial benchmarks where each action triggers structural changes, requiring continuous cognitive updates. Proposes a subjective experience-based memory mechanism for cross-task experience transfer.

Result: Benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic spatial reasoning and long-term memory capabilities.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating and advancing methods in dynamic spatial reasoning under partial observability and environmental dynamics.

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

### [88] [SPGen: Spherical Projection as Consistent and Flexible Representation for Single Image 3D Shape Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12721)
*Jingdong Zhang,Weikai Chen,Yuan Liu,Jionghao Wang,Zhengming Yu,Zhuowen Shen,Bo Yang,Wenping Wang,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen introduces a novel spherical projection representation that maps 3D geometry to 2D images, enabling consistent single-view 3D generation without view inconsistencies while supporting complex internal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view 3D generative models suffer from inter-view inconsistencies and cannot faithfully represent complex internal structures or nontrivial topologies when using multiview diffusion priors.

Method: Encodes geometry information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a compact multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation, operating solely in the image domain to leverage 2D diffusion priors.

Result: SPGen significantly outperforms existing baselines in both geometric quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating superior performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The spherical projection approach provides consistent, flexible, and efficient 3D generation by eliminating view inconsistency, supporting complex internal structures, and enabling efficient finetuning with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

### [89] [Defense-to-Attack: Bypassing Weak Defenses Enables Stronger Jailbreaks in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12724)
*Yunhan Zhao,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defense2Attack is a novel jailbreak method that leverages defensive patterns to enhance attack effectiveness on Vision-Language Models, achieving superior performance in single attempts compared to multi-try state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and existing methods lack both effectiveness and efficiency. The paper reveals that incorporating weak defense into attacks can significantly improve jailbreak performance.

Method: Defense2Attack uses three components: (1) visual optimizer with adversarial perturbations and encouraging semantics, (2) textual optimizer with defense-styled prompts, and (3) red-team suffix generator with reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: The method achieves superior jailbreak performance on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that typically require multiple attempts.

Conclusion: This work provides a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs by demonstrating that defensive patterns can be leveraged to create more effective and efficient attacks in single attempts.

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

*Jiateng Liu,Hao Gao,Jiu-Cheng Xie,Chi-Man Pun,Jian Xiong,Haolun Li,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Gaussian management approach for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction that dynamically activates spherical harmonics or normals, adapts SH orders based on gradients, and performs task-decoupled pruning to achieve superior results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of recent Gaussian Splatting methods that use indiscriminate attribute assignment, which causes gradient conflicts from dual supervision and inefficient representation.

Method: Introduces a densification strategy with dynamic activation of spherical harmonics or normals supervised by surface reconstruction, adaptive SH order adjustment based on gradient magnitudes, and task-decoupled pruning to remove unnecessary Gaussians.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and efficiency, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian management approach effectively mitigates gradient conflicts, improves representation efficiency, and is model-agnostic, making it easily integrable into other frameworks to enhance performance while reducing model size.

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

### [91] [Modelling and analysis of the 8 filters from the "master key filters hypothesis" for depthwise-separable deep networks in relation to idealized receptive fields based on scale-space theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12746)
*Tony Lindeberg,Zahra Babaiee,Peyman M. Kiasari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes and models master key filters from ConvNeXt-based depthwise-separable networks, showing they can be approximated by discrete scale-space filters with good predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks, specifically examining whether they can be represented by separable filtering operations and discrete Gaussian-based difference operators.

Method: Applied clustering to extract master key filters, computed spatial spread measures, modeled filters using difference operators applied to discrete Gaussian kernels, and performed model fitting using spatial variance matching and norm minimization.

Result: The learned filters show good qualitative similarity to idealized models, with non-centered filters having offsets close to half a grid unit. Idealized models demonstrate good predictive properties when replacing learned filters.

Conclusion: Learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well approximated by discrete scale-space filters, supporting the hypothesis that they operate as separable filtering operations over the spatial domain.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

*Rishab Parthasarathy,Jasmine Collins,Cory Stephenson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how multimodal LLMs and humans evaluate image quality across different attributes like aesthetics, artifacts, anatomical accuracy, composition, object adherence, and style, revealing significant differences in their perception and judgment capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated evaluation of text-to-image models is challenging, and while recent works use multimodal LLMs for image quality assessment, there's limited understanding of how these models utilize human-relevant concepts like style and composition in their judgments.

Method: The researchers curated a dataset of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs, analyzed inter-task correlation between image quality attributes for both humans and LLMs, and created synthetic datasets with controlled variations for each quality attribute to study individual attribute perception.

Result: Humans show strong inter-task correlations between image quality attributes and can easily judge all specific attributes, while LLMs show much weaker relationships between attributes and struggle particularly with anatomical accuracy judgment.

Conclusion: There are significant differences in how humans and multimodal LLMs perceive and evaluate image quality, with LLMs showing weaker understanding of attribute relationships and specific difficulties with certain quality dimensions like anatomical accuracy.

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCOT is a recurrent transformer for cross-view object geo-localization that uses iterative refinement with SAM knowledge distillation and hierarchical attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance with 60% fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVOGL approaches treat localization as one-shot detection, making them vulnerable to feature noise and lacking error correction mechanisms.

Method: Reformulates CVOGL as recurrent localization using learnable tokens that iteratively attend to reference features, plus SAM-based knowledge distillation and Reference Feature Enhancement Module with hierarchical attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard CVOGL benchmarks while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA approaches.

Conclusion: Recurrent localization with iterative refinement and enhanced feature attention significantly improves cross-view object geo-localization accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

TL;DR: A-TDOM is a near real-time True Digital Orthophoto Map generation method using On-the-Fly 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization that processes images sequentially for active TDOM rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDOM generation methods rely on complex offline photogrammetric pipelines causing delays, and quality degrades due to inaccurate camera poses, DSM errors, and scene occlusions.

Method: Uses On-the-Fly SfM to compute pose and sparse point cloud for each new image, integrates new Gaussians into unseen regions, and employs orthogonal splatting for immediate rendering after each 3DGS field update.

Result: A-TDOM achieves near real-time TDOM generation with 3DGS optimization for each new image completed in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality and geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables active, near real-time TDOM rendering with efficient sequential processing, overcoming limitations of traditional offline approaches.

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

### [96] [BATR-FST: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12768)
*Mohammed Al-Habib,Zuping Zhang,Abdulrahman Noman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BATR-FST is a two-stage Vision Transformer approach for few-shot learning that uses bi-level token refinement with clustering, uncertainty weighting, and attention mechanisms to improve performance on limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers struggle with few-shot learning due to poor token-level interactions, limited training data challenges, and weak inductive bias. Existing methods rely on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures that fail to incorporate global context and localized feature refinement effectively.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pre-training with Masked Image Modeling for transferable patch-level representations; 2) Meta-fine-tuning with Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module (Token Clustering, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting, Bi-Level Attention), Graph Token Propagation for semantic consistency, and Class Separation Penalty to preserve class boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets show BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, demonstrating improved few-shot classification performance via transformers.

Conclusion: BATR-FST effectively addresses Vision Transformers' limitations in few-shot learning by providing progressive token representation improvement and maintaining robust inductive bias through its bi-level adaptive refinement approach.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and

*Zhifang Gong,Shuo Gao,Ben Zhao,Yingjing Xu,Yijun Yang,Shenghong Ju,Guangquan Zhou*

TL;DR: Novel Mamba-based framework for pancreatic tumor subtyping using multi-phase CECT scans, achieving 97.4% accuracy in distinguishing PDAC from PNETs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to effectively utilize contextual information across multiple CECT phases used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, limiting performance for pancreatic tumor subtyping due to high heterogeneity and variability.

Method: Dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module with spatial and temporal sampling sequences to explore intra/inter-phase contrast variations. Includes similarity-guided refinement for temporal modeling, space complementary integrator, and multi-granularity fusion for cross-scale semantics.

Result: Achieved 97.4% accuracy and 98.6% AUC on 270 clinical cases for distinguishing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).

Conclusion: The proposed Mamba-based framework demonstrates superior performance for pancreatic tumor subtyping, offering a more accurate and efficient diagnostic tool compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

*Zhehao Li,Yucheng Qian,Chong Wang,Yinghao Lu,Zhihao Yang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Contextualized Representation Learning Network for HOI detection that integrates affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts to better capture complex interactions involving auxiliary entities like tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage HOI detection approaches face challenges due to incomplete context modeling, particularly for complex interactions involving multiple entities beyond simple human-object pairs.

Method: Expands HOI detection to include multivariate relationships through triplet structures <human, tool, object>, explicitly modeling functional roles (affordance) of auxiliary objects. Uses learnable prompts enriched with instance categories integrated with contextual visual features via attention mechanism to align language with image content.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on both HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed contextualized representation learning approach effectively captures complex, context-dependent interactions by integrating affordance reasoning and multimodal alignment, advancing HOI detection beyond simple human-object pairs.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

*Linchun Wu,Qin Zou,Xianbiao Qi,Bo Du,Zhongyuan Wang,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DH-Diff is a novel cross-domain generative framework that synthesizes high-fidelity anomaly images and pixel-level masks simultaneously, addressing structural inconsistency and feature entanglement issues in synthetic anomaly generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual anomaly inspection in manufacturing suffers from scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Current synthetic data generation methods have limitations: structurally inconsistent anomalies and feature entanglement between images and annotation masks.

Method: Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff) uses a double helix-inspired architecture with domain-decoupled attention mechanism to mitigate feature entanglement and semantic score map alignment module to ensure structural authenticity. It offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: DH-Diff provides an effective solution for synthetic anomaly data generation that addresses key limitations of existing methods, enabling better training of anomaly detection models in manufacturing applications.

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

TL;DR: SPAM is a deep learning framework that generates accurate and regular superpixels by combining learned image features with large-scale pretrained segmentation models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional superpixel methods use low-level features while deep learning approaches sacrifice regularity for accuracy. There's a need for superpixels that are both accurate and regular for better interpretability.

Method: Train a model to extract image features for superpixel generation, then leverage large-scale pretrained semantic-agnostic segmentation models at inference to align superpixels with object masks. Can handle prior segmentation and interactive object focus.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods on segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SPAM provides a versatile, robust framework for generating accurate yet regular superpixels, making it valuable for various computer vision applications.

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

### [102] [SAGA: Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12817)
*Yuan Cao,Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGA introduces selective adaptive gating to improve linear attention by addressing feature redundancy and low-rank constraints, achieving better efficiency and accuracy than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer's quadratic complexity with softmax attention is a bottleneck for high-resolution images. Linear attention reduces complexity but suffers from uniform compression of KV information, leading to feature redundancy and performance gap.

Method: Proposes SAGA with input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information aggregation into KV feature maps. Uses efficient Hadamard-product decomposition for gate computation without additional memory overhead.

Result: 1.76× throughput improvement and 2.69× reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at 1280×1280 resolution. Improves top-1 accuracy by up to 4.4% on ImageNet.

Conclusion: SAGA effectively bridges the performance gap between linear and softmax attention while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for high-resolution vision tasks.

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies continual pretraining of medical vision encoders (MI2 and RAD-DINO) on up to 3.5M chest x-rays, showing how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance across classification, segmentation, and report generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging foundation models are constrained by smaller datasets compared to general vision models like CLIP and DINOv2. The research aims to understand how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in medical imaging, particularly for tasks beyond radiology findings.

Method: Continual pretraining of two vision encoders (MI2 representing CLIP paradigm and RAD-DINO representing DINOv2 paradigm) on up to 3.5M chest x-rays from a single institution, with constant compute and evaluation protocols. Evaluation includes classification, segmentation, and radiology report generation tasks.

Result: MI2 scales better for finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks. Continual pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured labels using UniCL improves performance. For some tasks, as few as 30k in-domain samples can surpass open-weights foundation models.

Conclusion: Center-specific continual pretraining enables medical institutions to achieve significant performance gains using in-domain data, highlighting the utility of structured supervision at scale and the importance of task-specific encoder selection.

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

TL;DR: Combining DISTS and VMAF metrics improves correlation with subjective quality scores for NeRF-generated outputs, outperforming individual metrics across different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF-generated outputs exhibit unique artifacts that are challenging to evaluate, and no single metric performs well across all datasets. Combining different perceptual metrics could overcome individual limitations.

Method: Fusion of DISTS and VMAF metrics using two normalization strategies and two fusion strategies, tested on Synthetic and Outdoor datasets across three configurations.

Result: The fusion metrics achieved improved correlation with subjective quality scores compared to individual metrics, demonstrating robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Combining complementary perceptual metrics provides a more reliable evaluation framework for NeRF-generated content across diverse datasets and configurations.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

TL;DR: LLMs can generate synthetic visual training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses through text-to-visual mapping, achieving 88% F1 score on real data despite training only on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection is challenging for rare medical conditions and costly tasks. The paper addresses data scarcity in canine musculoskeletal diagnosis documentation by leveraging LLMs' text generation capabilities to create synthetic visual training data.

Method: Developed a mapping that segments visual documentations into 200+ labeled regions representing muscles/joints. Used guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting with LLMs to generate synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation and other diagnoses.

Result: Generated 1,000 synthetic documentations sensitive to location and severity while independent of dog's sex. A model trained solely on synthetic data achieved 88% F1 score on 70 real-world documentations for binary classification.

Conclusion: LLM-generated synthetic data shows strong potential for addressing data scarcity, particularly valuable for rare diseases. The methodology, though medical-domain specific, offers adaptable insights and techniques for other fields facing similar data limitations.

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

TL;DR: CCS is a label-free metric for evaluating object detectors using test-time augmentation and spatial consistency without ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth annotations are rarely available in real-world deployment, making it challenging to continuously monitor and compare object detection models.

Method: Applies test-time data augmentation, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented views, computes overlaps using IoU, normalizes maximum overlaps, and averages across augmentation pairs to measure spatial consistency.

Result: Achieved over 90% congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal Correction Cost in controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: CCS provides a robust, model-agnostic foundation for DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors, working across different detector types and highlighting under-performing scenarios at the case level.

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

TL;DR: PENet introduces a dual-stream prototype expansion framework using diffusion model features to address intra-class diversity and inter-set inconsistency in few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods suffer from limited representational capacity (intra-class diversity) and misalignment between support and query feature spaces (inter-set inconsistency) in few-shot 3D semantic segmentation.

Method: Prototype Expansion Network (PENet) with dual-stream architecture: Intrinsic Learner for representative features and Diffusion Learner using pre-trained diffusion encoder for generalizable features. Includes Prototype Assimilation Module with push-pull cross-guidance attention and Prototype Calibration Mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various few-shot settings.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses prototype limitations by leveraging diffusion model features and cross-space alignment, demonstrating superior performance in few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods fail to generalize effectively to diverse real-world user instructions outside their training domain, limiting practical applications.

Method: Uses Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with: 1) model-level toolkit of diverse models trained on limited data and image manipulation functions, 2) three-stage progressive reinforcement learning using feedback on unannotated open-domain instructions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench, exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions, and can utilize new editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit effectively addresses the generalization challenge in instruction-based image editing through MLLM-organized tool composition and progressive reinforcement learning, enabling practical application with diverse real-world instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

TL;DR: Proposes high-order inversion method and decoupled attention mechanism to improve rectified flow models' inversion accuracy and attention control for better image reconstruction and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow models suffer from low inversion accuracy (poor source image consistency) and entangled multimodal attention in diffusion transformers (hindering precise control).

Method: Uses Runge-Kutta solver for efficient high-order inversion, and introduces Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA) to disentangle text and image attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction and text-guided editing tasks with improved fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the major challenges of rectified flow models, enabling better consistency and control for practical applications.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

### [110] [MEJO: MLLM-Engaged Surgical Triplet Recognition via Inter- and Intra-Task Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12893)
*Yiyi Zhang,Yuchen Yuan,Ying Zheng,Jialun Pei,Jinpeng Li,Zheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework addresses inter-task and intra-task optimization conflicts in surgical triplet recognition through shared-specific representation disentanglement and coordinated gradient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical triplet recognition suffers from long-tailed data distribution and optimization conflicts - inter-task conflicts from entangled representations and intra-task conflicts from class-imbalanced training data.

Method: Proposes MEJO framework with: 1) Shared-Specific-Disentangled learning to separate task-shared and task-specific representations, 2) MLLM-powered probabilistic prompt pool for semantic augmentation, 3) Coordinated Gradient Learning to rebalance gradients from head and tail classes.

Result: Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses both inter-task and intra-task optimization conflicts in surgical triplet recognition through representation disentanglement and gradient coordination.

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

*Leekyeung Han,Hyunji Min,Gyeom Hwangbo,Jonghyun Choi,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DialNav introduces a collaborative embodied dialog task where a Navigator and Guide communicate to reach goals, with a new RAIN dataset and benchmark for holistic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks holistic evaluation and doesn't require Guides to infer Navigator locations, making communication less essential. DialNav addresses this gap by creating a task where successful navigation depends on effective dialog.

Method: Collected human-human dialog paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments (RAIN dataset), designed comprehensive benchmark for navigation and dialog evaluation, and conducted experiments with different Navigator/Guide models.

Result: Created the RAIN dataset with human dialog and navigation trajectories, established evaluation framework, identified key challenges in embodied dialog navigation, and released all resources publicly.

Conclusion: DialNav provides a novel task and dataset for collaborative embodied dialog research, highlighting communication challenges and enabling future work in this area through publicly available resources.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

### [112] [Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897)
*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLVS introduces vision memory to maintain sustained attention on key objects across model layers, improving visual understanding in LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs briefly attend to key objects, but sustained focus could enhance visual capabilities like relation and attribute understanding.

Method: Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS) with vision memory initialized from first-layer attention, updated iteratively across layers, and terminated using uncertainty as completion indicator.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks across three LVLMs, with significant improvements in relation and attribute understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Sustained attention through cross-layer smoothing effectively enhances LVLMs' visual capabilities, demonstrating strong generalizability across models and tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

### [113] [MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901)
*Guihui Li,Bowei Dong,Kaizhi Dong,Jiayi Li,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion is a novel infrared and visible image fusion framework that uses structured scene graphs to combine high-level semantic information with low-level visual details, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning fusion methods rely too much on low-level visual cues and struggle with high-level semantic information. Existing text-guided approaches use unstructured descriptions that lack explicit modeling of entities, attributes, and spatial relationships.

Method: MSGFusion uses multimodal scene graphs derived from text and vision to explicitly represent entities, attributes, and spatial relations. It employs successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion to synchronously refine both high-level semantics and low-level details.

Result: Extensive experiments show MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity. It delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks including low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Conclusion: The structured scene graph approach effectively bridges the gap between high-level semantics and low-level details in infrared and visible image fusion, providing a robust framework that outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks and applications.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

*Branko Mitic,Philipp Seeböck,Helmut Prosch,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel generative anomaly detection method using image-to-image translation and patch similarity scoring improves lesion segmentation in medical images, achieving +1.9% and +4.4% DICE score improvements in chest CT and brain MRI respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early disease detection, lesion severity assessment, and automated screening require effective anomaly detection methods. Normal tissue variability in pulmonary anatomy poses challenges for existing generative AD approaches.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: 1) image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction, and 2) patch similarity scoring between observed and generated image pairs for precise anomaly localization.

Result: Improved pixel-level anomaly segmentation in chest CT scans for infectious disease lesions and brain MRI for ischemic stroke lesions, with relative DICE score improvements of +1.9% and +4.4% compared to state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed generative AD approach effectively addresses normal tissue variability challenges and demonstrates strong generalizability across different medical imaging modalities and conditions.

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

*Hojat Ardi,Amir Jahanshahi,Ali Diba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN is a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that addresses limitations of existing trackers by incorporating temporal modeling, achieving significant performance improvements while maintaining real-time efficiency on embedded devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aerial object trackers overlook temporal dependencies and are constrained by linear correlation operations, limiting robustness in long-term tracking and handling complex appearance changes.

Method: Extends SiamTPN architecture with temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions to strengthen temporal consistency and enable richer feature representations.

Result: Improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7% over baseline, runs at 7.1 FPS on Jetson Nano, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling is crucial for Siamese tracking frameworks, and T-SiamTPN provides an efficient, real-time solution suitable for embedded aerial tracking applications.

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

*Melika Sabaghian,Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad,Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage compression pipeline for YOLOv8 that combines sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and knowledge distillation, achieving 73.51% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss while boosting inference speed from 26 to 68 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without compromising performance.

Method: Three-stage compression pipeline: 1) Sparsity-aware training with dynamic sparsity during optimization, 2) Structured channel pruning using batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, 3) Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation with adjustable temperature and loss weighting for small/medium object detection.

Result: For YOLOv8m: Parameters reduced from 25.85M to 6.85M (73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, MACs from 101G to 34.5G, with only 2.7% AP50 drop. Inference speed increased from 26 FPS to 45 FPS. With TensorRT optimization: 68 FPS with AP50 47.6.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time deployment on edge devices and demonstrates practicality for high-throughput, resource-constrained aerial object detection scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

### [117] [MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924)
*Shipeng Liu,Ziliang Xiong,Khac-Hoang Ngo,Per-Erik Forssén*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a regression-based approach for point cloud registration quality validation, using multiscale feature extraction and attention-based aggregation to provide fine-grained error estimation, especially effective for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat point cloud registration validation as a classification task with limited quality classes, but regression can provide more fine-grained quantification of registration quality. The authors aim to improve validation accuracy, particularly for point clouds with varying spatial densities.

Method: The authors use regression instead of classification for PCR validation, extend misalignment-related features with multiscale extraction, and employ attention-based aggregation for feature processing. This allows for more precise error estimation.

Result: The method achieves accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, showing particular strength with point clouds having heterogeneous spatial densities. When used to guide mapping tasks, it significantly improves mapping quality compared to state-of-the-art classification-based methods.

Conclusion: Regression-based PCR validation with multiscale feature extraction and attention-based aggregation provides superior fine-grained quality assessment compared to classification approaches, especially benefiting applications with diverse point cloud densities and improving downstream mapping performance.

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DRadar-GS is a novel 4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework that addresses dynamic object reconstruction challenges in autonomous driving scenes using radar velocity data and temporal consistency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised 3D reconstruction methods struggle with dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency, leading to incomplete or distorted representations in driving scenarios.

Method: Proposes a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization scheme for dynamic object segmentation and depth scale recovery, plus a Velocity-guided PointTrack model for fine-grained dynamic trajectory tracking with scene flow supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset.

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS effectively leverages 4D radar data to overcome limitations of existing methods, providing accurate and temporally consistent 3D reconstruction for dynamic autonomous driving scenes.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

*Abdalla Arafa,Didier Stricker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for 3D scene understanding using object-level Gaussian representations with CLIP feature aggregation, enabling accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval and seamless 2D/3D task adaptation without differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables real-time photorealistic rendering but lacks semantic understanding capabilities due to alpha blending limitations that average semantics across objects, restricting AR/VR and robotics applications.

Method: Leverages predecomposed object-level Gaussians and represents each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation to create comprehensive 'bags of embeddings' that holistically describe objects, bypassing differentiable rendering for semantics.

Result: Effectively overcomes challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art in 2D open-vocabulary segmentation with minimal compromise.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm-shifting approach enables accurate object-level semantic understanding in 3D Gaussian Splatting, facilitating broader applications in AR/VR and robotics through seamless 2D/3D task adaptation.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

TL;DR: TMKT is a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that interpolates RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps to enable effective knowledge transfer between modalities for spiking neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras and spiking neural networks offer energy-efficient visual processing, but face challenges due to limited event data availability and sparse DVS outputs. Existing methods overlook the significant distribution gap between RGB and DVS modalities.

Method: Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT) exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps. Introduces modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives to support label mixing in cross-modal scenarios.

Result: The approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: TMKT provides an effective solution for cross-modal knowledge transfer between RGB and DVS data, demonstrating improved performance for spiking neural networks in visual processing tasks.

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for interactive multi-surface segmentation using user clicks and multi-modal inputs, with a novel network architecture that integrates RGB, non-RGB modalities, and user interactions to improve segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of segmenting multiple entangled surfaces in the same image through interactive user clicks, while leveraging multi-modal inputs to facilitate the segmentation task and reduce user effort.

Method: A network architecture that takes RGB images, non-RGB modalities, erroneous masks, and encoded clicks as input to predict improved segmentation masks. The design ensures RGB backbone remains a black-box and integrates interaction-specific information after feature extraction to reduce response time.

Result: The method reduces NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on DeLiVER and up to 1.19 on MFNet. The RGB-only baseline also achieves competitive performance in classical single-mask interactive segmentation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal fusion strategy is effective for multi-surface interactive segmentation, significantly reducing user interaction effort while maintaining strong performance in both multi-modal and RGB-only scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical handwritten documents present unique challenges like irregular handwriting, faded ink, complex layouts, and scarcity of annotated datasets, making fully supervised approaches impractical.

Method: Participants develop few-shot learning systems using the U-DIADS-TL dataset with diverse ancient manuscripts featuring various layouts, degradation levels, and non-standard formatting.

Result: The competition aims to produce robust and adaptable text line segmentation methods that require minimal manual annotation.

Conclusion: FEST promotes development of automated document analysis tools that can be easily adopted by humanities scholars for historical research with reduced annotation effort.

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare protein surface shape retrieval methods, particularly focusing on the value of incorporating electrostatic potential as a complementary molecular surface descriptor.

Method: Evaluation of 15 different retrieval methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated electrostatic potential, using multiple metrics including Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall.

Result: Methods that used electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape achieved the best retrieval performance, even for classes with limited data.

Conclusion: Incorporating additional molecular surface descriptors like electrostatic potential alongside shape information significantly improves protein surface retrieval performance.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

### [124] [Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations: Making SIREN a WINNER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12980)
*Hemanth Chandravamsi,Dhanush V. Shenoy,Steven H. Frankel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER addresses SIRENs' spectral bottleneck by using Gaussian noise initialization scaled to target signal's spectral centroid, achieving state-of-the-art performance without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIRENs struggle with signals outside their frequency support due to poor initialization, causing spectral bottlenecks where networks fail to represent even in-capacity frequencies.

Method: Proposes WINNER - Weight Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. Uses Gaussian noise perturbation on uniformly initialized weights, with noise scales adaptively determined by target signal's spectral centroid.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting tasks over base SIREN. Mitigates spectral bias without introducing additional trainable parameters.

Conclusion: WINNER provides an effective solution to SIRENs' spectral limitations and suggests new adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for deep neural network optimization.

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

TL;DR: A Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts framework for detecting subtle and infrequent user action mistakes from egocentric video, combining multiple feature extractors and classifiers with specialized loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying subtle and infrequent mistakes in user actions from egocentric video data, where traditional methods struggle with class imbalance and ambiguous instances.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Feature extraction using frozen ViViT and LoRA-tuned ViViT models combined through feature-level expert module; 2) Three classifiers with different objectives (reweighted cross-entropy, AUC loss, label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization) fused via classification-level expert module.

Result: Achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances from egocentric video data.

Conclusion: The DR-MoE framework effectively handles class imbalance and subtle mistake detection through its dual-stage expert fusion approach, demonstrating robust performance on challenging egocentric video mistake recognition tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

### [127] [Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12995)
*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple linear classifier on modern Vision Foundation Models outperforms specialized AI-generated image detectors by over 20% in real-world scenarios, due to VFMs' learned alignment with forgery concepts through data exposure during pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized AI-generated image detectors perform well on curated benchmarks but fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios with high false-negative rates, requiring a more robust solution.

Method: Using a simple linear classifier on top of modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) trained on identical data as specialized detectors, and analyzing text-image similarities to understand the source of VFM's effectiveness.

Result: The VFM-based baseline decisively outperforms bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by over 20%. The effectiveness comes from VFMs' learned alignment with forgery-related concepts through data exposure during pre-training.

Conclusion: Modern VFMs provide superior real-world detection capability compared to specialized static detectors, and true generalization evaluation requires test data independent of the model's entire training history including pre-training.

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

TL;DR: Neuromorphic drone detection system using spiking neural networks and event cameras that is highly energy efficient and can run for over a year on battery power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small drones pose increasing threats to military and civilian infrastructure, requiring early automated detection systems.

Method: Developed a fully neuromorphic system using spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras deployed on neuromorphic chips, with multiple units creating virtual tripwires for drone detection.

Result: System is several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than GPU-based solutions, runs for over a year on battery, and relies on drone shape rather than propeller temporal characteristics.

Conclusion: The small size and low power consumption enable easy deployment in contested areas or locations lacking power infrastructure.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

### [129] [Dream3DAvatar: Text-Controlled 3D Avatar Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13013)
*Gaofeng Liu,Hengsen Li,Ruoyu Gao,Xuetong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dream3DAvatar is a two-stage framework for text-controllable 3D avatar generation from single images, using adapter-enhanced multi-view generation and transformer-based 3D reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-image 3D avatar reconstruction methods struggle with controlling geometry and texture of occluded regions due to the ill-posed nature of monocular input, requiring better solutions for consistent and controllable generation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Lightweight adapter-enhanced multi-view generation with Pose-Adapter for geometric consistency and ID-Adapter-G for facial identity preservation, plus BLIP2 for text descriptions; 2) Feedforward Transformer with multi-view feature fusion for 3DGS reconstruction and ID-Adapter-R for facial detail recovery.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method generates realistic, animation-ready 3D avatars without post-processing and outperforms existing baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar provides an efficient and text-controllable solution for high-fidelity 3D avatar generation from single images, effectively addressing challenges in occluded region reconstruction and geometric consistency.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

### [130] [Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031)
*Yan Chen,Long Li,Teng Xi,Long Zeng,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage reinforcement learning framework for vision-language models that separately enhances visual perception and reasoning capabilities, addressing the complexity of VLM tasks compared to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal because VLMs face more complex tasks requiring accurate visual perception before reasoning can occur.

Method: Two-stage RL framework: first stage improves visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, second stage enhances reasoning abilities. Uses dataset-level sampling to mitigate vanishing advantage issues.

Result: Developed PeBR-R1 model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities, achieving superior performance on seven benchmark datasets across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage RL approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of VLMs and demonstrates substantial improvements in both perception and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERO is a training-free framework that reduces computational overhead in high-resolution LVLMs by selectively dropping less important visual tokens based on content importance and functional roles, achieving better efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution LVLMs generate excessive visual tokens from cropped image tiles, causing substantial computational and memory overhead that needs to be addressed for efficient inference.

Method: Proposes HERO framework with content-adaptive token budget allocation and function-aware token selection based on empirical findings about tile importance, CLIP encoder attention patterns, and token granularity.

Result: HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: The study provides both empirical insights into visual token utilization and a practical training-free solution for efficient inference in high-resolution LVLMs.

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TFANet is a three-stage network that addresses multimodal misalignment in Referring Image Segmentation through hierarchical feature alignment modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RIS methods struggle with multimodal misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes with multiple visually similar objects, leading to mislocalization and incomplete segmentation.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Knowledge Plus Stage with Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module for bidirectional semantic exchange, 2) Knowledge Fusion Stage with Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module for long-range dependency modeling, 3) Knowledge Intensification Stage with Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module to compensate for semantic degradation.

Result: The proposed method establishes rich and efficient alignment between image regions and linguistic descriptions, enhances multimodal representation, and improves alignment accuracy in complex scenes.

Conclusion: TFANet systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a hierarchical three-stage approach, effectively addressing challenges in complex referring image segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLFDisc is a U-shaped deep enhancement network that uses cross-attention and gating mechanisms for frequency-aware enhancement, with a novel distribution-aware loss using KL-Divergence for better Fourier-domain alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Fourier frequency fitting uses pixel-wise loss functions that focus too much on local information and cause global information loss. There's a need for better Fourier-domain information alignment.

Method: U-shaped deep network with cross-attention and gating mechanisms. Novel distribution-aware loss using closed-form KL-Divergence to minimize Fourier-domain divergence. Enhanced perceptual loss with KL-Divergence on VGG features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: LLFDisc effectively addresses Fourier-domain information alignment with distribution-aware loss, outperforming conventional MSE-based approaches while maintaining structural fidelity.

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework using dual-network architecture with cross consistency enhancement, uncertainty-aware weighting, and self-supervised contrastive learning to address noisy pseudo-labels and insufficient supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised medical image segmentation requires large labeled datasets which are impractical in real-world scenarios. Existing semi-supervised methods suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and insufficient feature space supervision.

Method: Dual-network architecture with Cross Consistency Enhancement module using cross pseudo and entropy-filtered supervision, dynamic uncertainty-aware weighting strategy (KL divergence), and self-supervised contrastive learning to align uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes.

Result: Achieved 89.95% Dice score on Left Atrial with 10% labeled data, consistently superior performance across three 3D segmentation datasets (Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas, BraTS-2019) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces noisy pseudo-labels and prediction uncertainty through cross consistency enhancement and contrastive learning, demonstrating significant performance improvements in semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A synthetic data generation pipeline using CAD models and object detection for visual assembly quality control, achieving high accuracy (up to 99.5% on synthetic data, 93% on real data) while reducing manual data collection needs for SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision methods for assembly quality control require extensive image acquisition, annotation, and training resources, which are particularly challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited resources.

Method: Leverages simulated scene generation based on CAD data and object detection algorithms to create a time-saving pipeline for generating synthetic training data, eliminating the need for manual image collection and annotation.

Result: Achieved mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) up to 99.5% on synthetic planetary gear system components in simulated training data, and up to 93% when transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation provides an effective and adaptable pipeline that can support SMEs in implementing resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions, significantly reducing manual data collection and labeling requirements.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

### [137] [Weakly and Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13116)
*Ruibo Li,Hanyu Shi,Zhe Wang,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction from LiDAR using foreground/background or non-ground/ground masks instead of motion annotations, with novel loss functions that achieve performance rivaling supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion understanding is critical for autonomous driving, but motion annotation is expensive. Outdoor scenes naturally separate into mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, suggesting motion prediction can be associated with scene parsing to reduce annotation requirements.

Method: Proposes weakly supervised paradigm using fully/partially annotated foreground/background masks (1%, 0.1%, 0.01%) or non-ground/ground masks as supervision. Develops Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss with multi-frame information and robust penalty functions to handle outliers in self-supervised learning.

Result: Weakly and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts. Weakly supervised models even rival some supervised methods, demonstrating effective balance between annotation effort and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches successfully leverage scene structure cues (foreground/background, non-ground/ground) to enable motion prediction with minimal or no annotations, providing a practical solution for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

### [138] [Advancing Real-World Parking Slot Detection with Large-Scale Dataset and Semi-Supervised Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13133)
*Zhihao Zhang,Chunyu Lin,Lang Nie,Jiyuan Wang,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CRPS-D, a large-scale parking slot detection dataset with diverse real-world conditions, and SS-PSD, a semi-supervised method that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parking slot detection datasets are limited in scale and lack real-world noise, while manual annotation is costly and error-prone due to complex conditions.

Method: Constructed CRPS-D dataset with various lighting, weather, and challenging parking slot variants. Developed SS-PSD, a semi-supervised teacher-student model with confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.

Result: SS-PSD demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art solutions on both the proposed dataset and existing datasets, with performance gains increasing with more unlabeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed large-scale dataset and semi-supervised approach significantly advance parking slot detection, with the method showing particular effectiveness when more unlabeled data is available.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

### [139] [MSDNet: Efficient 4D Radar Super-Resolution via Multi-Stage Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13149)
*Minqing Huang,Shouyi Lu,Boyuan Zheng,Ziyao Li,Xiao Tang,Guirong Zhuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDNet is a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers LiDAR priors to 4D radar features for high-quality super-resolution with low latency, using reconstruction-guided and diffusion-guided feature distillation with adaptive noise alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D radar super-resolution methods suffer from high training costs, complex diffusion-based sampling, high inference latency, and poor generalization, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Two-stage distillation: 1) Reconstruction-guided feature distillation to align and densify features, 2) Diffusion-guided feature distillation using a lightweight diffusion network with noise adapter for adaptive noise level alignment with predefined diffusion timesteps.

Result: Extensive experiments on VoD and in-house datasets show MSDNet achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference, with consistent performance improvements on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSDNet effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing both accurate 4D radar point cloud super-resolution and computational efficiency through multi-stage distillation.

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout
is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual
presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial
for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency
or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce
TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-video collaborative framework that uses spatio-temporal graphs to represent video knowledge and fuse information from related videos to improve video language model reasoning and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video language models suffer from spatio-temporal incompleteness in individual videos, leading to hallucinations and inaccuracies. Multiple related videos could enhance reasoning but directly feeding them to LLMs is inefficient due to redundant video tokens.

Method: Proposes a framework with three modules: 1) Video Structuring Module to represent video knowledge as spatio-temporal graphs, 2) Graph Fusion Module to fuse knowledge from related videos into augmented graph nodes, 3) Multi-video structured prompt integrating graph, visual, and textual tokens for LLM input.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework's effectiveness in improving video reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The multi-video collaborative framework with structured graph representation shows promise for advancing video language models by addressing spatio-temporal incompleteness issues.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Motivation: Traditional field surveys for street tree inventory are time-consuming and labor-intensive, while existing Mobile Mapping System datasets are limited by small scale, limited annotation, or single modality, restricting comprehensive urban tree analysis.

Method: Collected cross-city dataset with synchronized point clouds and high-resolution images, containing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50 species with 2 morphological parameters, enabling multi-modal data fusion for various street tree inventory tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate significant potential of multi-modal data fusion and highlight cross-domain applicability as critical for practical algorithm deployment. The dataset supports benchmarking for key tasks like tree species classification and individual tree segmentation.

Conclusion: WHU-STree addresses limitations of existing datasets and enables comprehensive street tree analysis. Key challenges identified include multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization, spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model applications for urban tree management.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

TL;DR: LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports with high accuracy (>96% AUC), enabling low-cost creation of large-scale medical datasets for supervised pre-training that achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for revolutionizing medical contrastive vision-language pre-training by enabling large-scale supervised pre-training at minimal cost, thereby democratizing access to advanced medical AI systems.

Method: Using LLMs to automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports without complex prompt engineering, creating "silver-standard" datasets (~$3 for 50k CT image-report pairs), and training vision encoders with vanilla CLIP training on 3D ResNet-18 architecture.

Result: Achieved 83.8% AUC for zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and significant improvements in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2% for report-image). Performance comparable to specialized BERT-based models.

Conclusion: LLMs enable more performant and scalable medical AI systems by facilitating low-cost, large-scale supervised pre-training that fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language alignment, demonstrating the democratization potential of this approach.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing road-obstacle segmentation methods work on individual frames, ignoring temporal consistency between consecutive frames, which leads to inconsistent predictions in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: The authors curated and adapted four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle video segmentation, evaluated 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based segmentation methods, and introduced two baseline methods based on vision foundation models.

Result: The approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video sequences, demonstrating the importance of temporal consistency in this task.

Conclusion: Road-obstacle segmentation is inherently temporal, and the proposed methods with vision foundation models provide valuable insights and direction for future research in autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End4 is a novel detection method that identifies images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models using denoising reconstruction and scale-aware feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have advanced image synthesis but raise concerns about malicious misuse. Existing approaches fail to detect images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when trained on similar data.

Method: End4 uses end-to-end denoising diffusion with a denoising reconstruction model to align latent spaces, and a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) to refine local image features using attention pyramid layers at different scales.

Result: Extensive experiments show End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. A comprehensive benchmark with five distinct masked regions was established for evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed End4 method successfully addresses the challenge of detecting diffusion-based inpainted images and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different masking patterns and perturbations.

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

*Hugo Carlesso,Josiane Mothe,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning framework (CMTSSL) for lightweight hyperspectral imaging models that integrates masked image modeling with spatial/spectral jigsaw puzzles, enabling 16,000x lighter models with improved segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging produces high-dimensional data but satellite systems have slow data transfer rates, requiring compact models for onboard processing to minimize transmission of redundant data like cloud-covered areas.

Method: CMTSSL combines masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, using curriculum learning to progressively increase data complexity during self-supervision for joint feature capture.

Result: Validated on four public benchmark datasets, showing consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks using architectures over 16,000x lighter than state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CMTSSL demonstrates strong potential for generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures suitable for real-world hyperspectral imaging applications and onboard satellite deployment.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResidualViT: A vision transformer architecture that reduces computational cost for temporally dense video tasks by leveraging temporal redundancy, with learnable residual connections and token reduction, achieving up to 60% cost reduction and 2.5x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally dense video tasks require high-resolution frame processing which is computationally expensive. There's a need to reduce feature computation costs while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Proposes ResidualViT architecture with learnable residual connections for temporal consistency and token reduction module to discard redundant information. Uses lightweight distillation to approximate original foundation model features.

Result: Achieves up to 60% reduction in computational cost and 2.5x faster inference speed across four tasks and five datasets, while closely matching the accuracy of the original foundation model in both zero-shot and supervised settings.

Conclusion: ResidualViT effectively reduces computational burden for temporally dense video tasks by exploiting temporal redundancy, making high-resolution video processing more efficient without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

TL;DR: RadGame is an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education that improves localization accuracy by 68% and report-writing accuracy by 31% compared to traditional methods through automated feedback systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radiology training relies on passive case exposure or limited real-time feedback from supervising radiologists, creating scalability issues and lack of immediate structured guidance for learners.

Method: Combines gamification with public datasets and AI-driven feedback. RadGame Localize uses bounding box drawing compared to radiologist annotations with visual explanations. RadGame Report provides structured AI feedback on report composition using radiology report generation metrics compared to ground truth reports.

Result: Participants achieved 68% improvement in localization accuracy (vs 17% with traditional methods) and 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy (vs 4% with traditional methods) after seeing the same cases.

Conclusion: RadGame demonstrates the potential of AI-driven gamification for scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines medical AI applications in education.

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

TL;DR: A framework for assessing perceptual realness of AI-generated images using vision-language models to provide both overall realness scores and local inconsistency maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable quantification of AI-generated image realness and identification of visually inconsistent regions to improve photorealism through realness feedback during training.

Method: Multimodal approach using textual descriptions of visual inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets as substitutes for human annotations.

Result: Improved objective realness prediction performance and production of dense realness maps that effectively distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully accomplishes both overall realness assessment and local inconsistency identification for AI-generated images.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated

use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness

*Zefan Qu,Zhenwei Wang,Haoyuan Wang,Ke Xu,Gerhard Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleSculptor is a training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D assets from content and style images, using a novel Style Disentangled Attention module for fine-grained texture and geometry control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating 3D assets that match existing styles is crucial for applications like gaming and VR, but current methods struggle with style-controllable 3D generation.

Method: Uses Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module with cross-3D attention for dynamic content-style interaction, plus style-disentangled feature selection to prevent semantic leakage and Style Guided Control for adjustable stylization.

Result: Outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets with fine-grained style control over texture, geometry, or both.

Conclusion: StyleSculptor enables zero-shot, training-free style-guided 3D generation with effective style disentanglement and adjustable control, addressing complex 3D asset creation challenges.

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect single-view 2D images with multi-view 3D data through a shared representation space, eliminating the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling while enabling accurate spatial reasoning across different views.

Method: Enriches 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, allowing the 3D model to leverage strong 2D priors for spatial reasoning. Supports flexible region prompting via bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or direct 3D annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both general 2D vision-language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks. Effectively infers spatial relationships and metric measurements even on in-the-wild videos without 3D inputs or ground-truth annotations.

Conclusion: SR-3D successfully unifies 2D and 3D representation spaces for scene understanding, demonstrating strong applicability to real-world scenarios without requiring sensory 3D inputs or extensive annotations.

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: Historical context significantly improves financial news analysis for stock market predictions using a dual-model approach with large and small language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial news requires historical context for accurate interpretation, but identifying and incorporating relevant contextual information is challenging.

Method: Proposed efficient contextualization method using large LM to process main article and small LM to encode historical context into summary embeddings aligned with large model's representation space.

Result: Historical context provides consistent and significant performance improvement across methods and time horizons, with substantial improvements in simulated investment performance.

Conclusion: Historical context adds significant value to financial news analysis and has real-world applications for investment performance.

Abstract: Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in
financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the
information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often
requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate
interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant
contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we
explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models
to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical
context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across
methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective
contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article,
while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings
that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore
the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative
interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization.
Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model
predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial
improvements in simulated investment performance.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Analysis of podcast transcripts shows emotional patterns in BLM activism discourse, with different positive emotions associated with various stages of collective action and unexpected negative correlations with negative emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how participation in collective action is expressed in audio formats like podcasts, specifically examining the Black Lives Matter movement, as previous research has focused primarily on text-based content.

Method: Used the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC) to analyze podcast transcripts discussing racial justice after key BLM events in May-June 2020. Employed a layered framework to extract participatory statements categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution, then examined emotional dimensions using eight key emotions.

Result: Found that emotional profiles vary by activism stage, with different positive emotions prominent during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. Detected negative associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to theoretical expectations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and reveals that emotional framing may depend on the discussion format, contributing to better understanding of collective action expression in audio media.

Abstract: We study how participation in collective action is articulated in podcast
discussions, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a case study. While
research on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based
content, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using
podcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we
investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action,
categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We
identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important
BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory
statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media.
We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key
emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that
emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out
during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative
associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to
theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how
activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may
depend on the format of the discussion.

### [156] [MEUV: Achieving Fine-Grained Capability Activation in Large Language Models via Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12221)
*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Meng Han,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEUV framework creates topic-specific unlock vectors to bypass LLM safety filters with precise control, reducing cross-topic leakage by 90% while maintaining high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety alignment blocks both malicious and legitimate requests in high-stakes domains like policing and defense. Existing refusal-direction edits lack semantic control and indiscriminately unlock all hazardous topics.

Method: Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV) factorizes refusal direction into topic-aligned orthogonal vectors using multi-task objective with differential-ablation margin, cross-topic penalties, and orthogonality constraints.

Result: Achieves ≥87% attack success rate on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen-7B, reduces cross-topic leakage by 90% vs baselines, and shows language-agnostic transfer between Chinese and English.

Conclusion: Fine-grained topic-level capability activation is achievable with minimal utility loss, enabling controlled LLM deployment in security-sensitive domains through language-agnostic refusal subspaces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

*Rishab Parthasarathy,Achintya Bhowmik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-based pathway analysis framework using RNNs to predict cancer severity and mutation progression, achieving >60% accuracy without wet lab data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cancer remains a major cause of death, and current pathway analysis relies on time-consuming wet lab data. There's a need for efficient computational methods to predict cancer progression and recommend treatments.

Method: Combines time-series ML models with pathway analysis. Uses TCGA mutation data, novel preprocessing to filter key mutations by frequency, RNN for cancer severity prediction, and probabilistic integration with drug-target databases for mutation prediction and treatment recommendations.

Result: Achieved robust results with ROC curves >60% accuracy, similar to existing diagnostics. Preprocessing identified few-hundred key driver mutations per cancer stage. Generated heatmaps highlighting key mutations.

Conclusion: First efficient end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and treatment recommendations without wet lab work, demonstrating cost-effectiveness and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

### [158] [Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12760)
*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) activation function that improves upon standard softmax by adding similarity and distance awareness, making neural networks more robust to distribution shifts and providing interpretable exemplar-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax activation lacks awareness of similarity to training examples and distance from training distribution, making it vulnerable to covariate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs. The authors aim to create a more robust and interpretable activation function.

Method: Developed the SDM activation function that incorporates three components: similarity awareness (correctly predicted depth-matches), distance-to-training-distribution awareness, and the existing magnitude awareness (decision-boundary) from softmax.

Result: The SDM activation function demonstrates improved robustness to covariate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions. It provides interpretability via dense matching and enables partitioning of class-wise empirical CDFs to protect against low class-wise recall in selective classification.

Conclusion: SDM activation is preferable over standard softmax for selective classification tasks, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods, due to its enhanced robustness, interpretability, and ability to guard against poor class-wise recall.

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

Motivation: Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions of LLM alignment, lacking a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs between competing objectives like factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.

Method: Proposed a unified evaluation framework using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt validated through human studies to compare PPO, DPO, ORPO, and KTO alignment methods.

Result: DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. The study reveals method-specific strengths across different alignment objectives.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the development of more balanced and reliable LLMs by understanding which methods excel in specific dimensions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that reverse reasoning data (r1k) improves model performance over forward reasoning (s1k), but mixing both directions weakens directional distinction. DPO can partially recover distinction but shifts probability mass to irrelevant outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on unidirectional SFT and overlook the interplay between diverse reasoning patterns. The authors want to examine how SFT and DPO affect alignment under bidirectional reasoning objectives.

Method: Constructed r1k (reverse reasoning dataset) by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k. Examined SFT and DPO effects on bidirectional reasoning through comparative experiments.

Result: SFT on r1k yields 1.6%-6.8% accuracy improvement over s1k. Mixing forward and reverse data weakens directional distinction. DPO partially recovers distinction but suppresses less preferred reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting supervision signals, highlighting the need for robust and direction-aware alignment strategies.

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on complex information-seeking benchmarks that open-source models cannot achieve, due to their inability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes.

Method: WebSailor uses structured sampling and information obfuscation to generate novel high-uncertainty tasks, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm called Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO) to instill systematic uncertainty reduction capabilities.

Result: WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks and matches the performance of proprietary agents, effectively closing the capability gap between open-source and proprietary systems.

Conclusion: The proposed WebSailor methodology successfully enables open-source LLMs to transcend human cognitive limitations in information-seeking tasks by teaching them the sophisticated reasoning patterns previously exclusive to proprietary systems.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerM-MoE is a novel multimodal method for Alzheimer's disease progression prediction that uses independent routers per modality to handle high missingness rates, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models fail to make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, which is common in clinical settings for Alzheimer's disease.

Method: PerM-MoE uses a sparse mixture-of-experts approach with independent routers for each modality (T1-weighted MRI, FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, tau PET) instead of a single router.

Result: PerM-MoE outperforms state-of-the-art Flex-MoE and unimodal models in most variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective expert utilization.

Conclusion: The independent router approach increases multimodal model flexibility and performance under high modality missingness conditions in Alzheimer's disease progression prediction.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

*Changqing Liu,Kaining Dai,Zhiwei Zhao,Tianyi Wu,Yingguang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural diffeomorphic-neural operator (NDNO) framework is introduced to efficiently predict machining deformation in structural components with varying geometries by mapping complex 3D shapes to a common reference domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of machining deformation is crucial for dimensional precision, but conventional numerical methods are computationally expensive for diverse geometries, and existing neural operators face limitations when applied across changing geometric domains.

Method: The proposed NDNO framework uses a diffeomorphic neural network to map complex 3D geometries to a common reference domain with smoothness and invertibility constraints, then trains a neural operator on this domain to learn deformation fields induced by residual stresses.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy and efficiency in predicting both main-direction and multi-direction deformation fields across parts with diverse geometries, including different component types, dimensions, and features.

Conclusion: The NDNO framework provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for deformation prediction in structural components with varying geometries, enabling rapid adaptation to different shapes while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and

TL;DR: InJecteD is a framework for interpreting DDPMs by analyzing denoising trajectories in 2D point cloud generation, using statistical metrics to quantify trajectory properties and enhance model transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and debugging of denoising diffusion models by making their internal denoising process more interpretable and transparent for human-AI collaboration.

Method: Analyzes sample trajectories during denoising process using statistical metrics (Wasserstein distance, cosine similarity) to quantify displacement, velocity, clustering, and drift field dynamics. Tested on three datasets with simplified DDPM architecture and customizable embeddings.

Result: Identified distinct denoising phases: initial noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement. Dataset-specific behaviors observed. Fourier-based embeddings improved trajectory stability and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: InJecteD successfully provides interpretable insights into DDPM behavior, enabling better debugging and refinement of generative models through trajectory analysis and statistical quantification.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a
simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our
approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings
improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

TL;DR: iCD is a knowledge distillation method that transfers interpretable structural knowledge from logits using Gram matrices, improving performance without requiring labels or feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logit Knowledge Distillation lacks interpretability in decision-making despite its simplicity and no need for intermediate feature alignment.

Method: Uses implicit Clustering Distillation (iCD) with Gram matrices over decoupled local logit representations to transfer latent semantic structural patterns.

Result: Achieves significant improvements across diverse architectures, with +5.08% peak improvement in fine-grained classification tasks.

Conclusion: iCD provides an effective and interpretable knowledge distillation approach that works well without ground-truth labels or feature-space alignment.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

TL;DR: Tool-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that enables large language models to perform multi-step tool use through executable Python code generation, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have limitations in handling real-world tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use, which motivates the development of a framework for reliable tool-augmented reasoning.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework with executable Python code generation, user-defined tool integration, variable sharing across steps, outcome-based reward function combining LLM judgment and code execution success, and dynamic sample queue for efficient training.

Result: Substantial improvements in both accuracy and robustness on GAIA benchmark with about 10% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: Tool-R1 demonstrates strong potential for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications through its reinforcement learning approach to compositional tool use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.

### [167] [Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12939)
*Haneen Najjar,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sy-FAR technique improves adversarial robustness fairness by ensuring symmetric attack success rates between classes, rather than perfect parity, making it more practical for real-world applications like face recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial robustness methods create unfairness where some classes/groups are easier to attack than others. Perfect fairness is often infeasible in realistic scenarios like face recognition due to natural class similarities.

Method: Developed Sy-FAR technique that encourages symmetry in attack success rates (attacks from class i to j should be as successful as from j to i) while optimizing adversarial robustness.

Result: Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness across 5 datasets and 3 model architectures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It's faster, more consistent, and reduces vulnerability of target classes that adversarial examples tend to be classified into.

Conclusion: Symmetry is a more tractable and desirable fairness goal than perfect parity for adversarial robustness, as it naturally handles class similarities and induces group-level fairness while being practically achievable.

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

### [168] [LLMAP: LLM-Assisted Multi-Objective Route Planning with User Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12273)
*Liangqi Yuan,Dong-Jun Han,Christopher G. Brinton,Sabine Brunswicker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that combines LLM-as-Parser for natural language understanding with Multi-Step Graph Search algorithm for optimal route planning, achieving superior performance across global cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based route planning approaches struggle with handling extensive map data or understanding natural language preferences, and face challenges with heterogeneous global user distribution patterns.

Method: Uses LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language and extract preferences, coupled with Multi-Step Graph construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm for route optimization with adaptive objective weight tuning.

Result: Achieves superior performance across 1,000 routing prompts in 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide, maximizing POI quality and task completion while minimizing distance under time, opening hours, and dependency constraints.

Conclusion: The LLMAP system effectively bridges the gap between natural language understanding and optimal route planning, providing guaranteed performance across multiple real-world constraints in diverse global scenarios.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

*Danielle Cohen,Yoni Halpern,Noam Kahlon,Joel Oren,Omri Berkovitch,Sapir Caduri,Ido Dagan,Anatoly Efros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decomposed approach for on-device intent inference from UI interactions using structured summarization and fine-tuned models, achieving better performance than large MLLMs while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small on-device models struggle with accurate intent inference from UI interaction trajectories compared to large datacenter-based MLLMs, creating a need for privacy-preserving, low-cost, low-latency solutions.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) structured interaction summarization to capture key information from each user action, 2) intent extraction using a fine-tuned model operating on aggregated summaries.

Result: The method improves intent understanding in resource-constrained models and even surpasses the base performance of large multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

Conclusion: Decomposed approach enables effective on-device intent inference with better performance than large models while maintaining privacy and low latency.

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco is a framework that uses LLMs to create adaptive heuristic ensembles for SAT solvers, enabling robust generalization across different problem types without re-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAT solver performance depends on internal heuristics, but no single configuration works optimally for all problems. Existing automated methods require costly re-optimization for each problem family and lack generalizability.

Method: Uses Large Language Model guided by Problem Archetypes to generate diverse heuristic ensembles, then learns an adaptive selection mechanism to map instance features to tailored heuristic configurations.

Result: DaSAThco achieves superior performance and demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive methods fail.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and practical approach for automated algorithm design in complex configurable systems through train-once, adapt-broadly model.

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRRAF is a training-free method that combines RAG with LLMs' code generation for graph reasoning tasks, achieving 100% accuracy on most tasks while scaling to 10k-node graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods that require extensive finetuning or predefined algorithms for graph reasoning tasks.

Method: Stores target graph in database, prompts LLM to generate executable code queries for information retrieval, uses error feedback loop with time-out mechanism.

Result: 100% accuracy on cycle detection, bipartite checks, shortest path, max flow; high performance on subgraph matching; scales to 10k nodes; consistent token costs.

Conclusion: GRRAF provides an effective, scalable training-free solution for diverse graph reasoning tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt is a simple, data-efficient framework that isolates concept-specific representations in LLMs, enabling precise interventions that suppress refusal on targeted concepts while preserving safety elsewhere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods in LLMs often have broader effects than desired, motivating the need for purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level.

Method: RepIt framework for isolating concept-specific representations, using corrective signals that localize to just 100-200 neurons and can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000 GPU.

Result: Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions that selectively suppress refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior, though the efficiency raises dual concerns about potential misuse with modest compute and data.

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Proposed novel metrics beyond win rate including ability utilization and advancement efficiency.

Result: The benchmark serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: HLSMAC successfully addresses the gap in evaluating high-level strategic capabilities in MARL and opens up new avenues for assessing strategic decision-making in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic

benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that

TL;DR: MLLMs like GPT-4o and MedGemma show promise for diabetic retinopathy screening, with MedGemma outperforming GPT-4o in baseline detection but GPT-4o achieving strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, suggesting potential for improved clinical AI assistance and scalable simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FDA-cleared diabetic retinopathy screening systems provide minimal binary referral outputs, which may limit clinical trust and utility. There's a need to determine more effective output formats to enhance clinician-AI performance at scale.

Method: Evaluated two multimodal large language models (GPT-4o and MedGemma) on IDRiD and Messidor-2 datasets through: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs.

Result: MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline with higher sensitivity and AUROC. GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. In collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results (AUROC up to 0.96) when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access.

Conclusion: MLLMs can improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance. Open models like MedGemma are valuable in low-resource settings, and descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

### [179] [The Adaptation Paradox: Agency vs. Mimicry in Companion Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12525)
*T. James Brandt,Cecilia Xi Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: User-generated avatars boost rapport in companion chatbots, but adaptive language style matching underperforms static style and is paradoxically judged less adaptive, creating an "Adaptation Paradox" where synchrony erodes connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify effective principles for fostering genuine connection in generative AI companion chatbots, testing two approaches: visible user authorship vs covert language-style mimicry.

Method: Preregistered 3x2 experiment (N=162) manipulating user-controlled avatar generation (none, premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs adaptive).

Result: Avatar generation boosted rapport (ω²=.040, p=.013), while adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and satisfaction (d=0.35, p=.009) and was judged less adaptive (t=3.07, p=.003, d=0.48).

Conclusion: Designers should prioritize legible, user-driven personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry, as visible authorship fosters natural interaction while covert mimicry risks incoherence.

Abstract: Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for
fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user
authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2
experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none,
premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs.
adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013),
whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and
satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t
= 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony
erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To
explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship
fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our
findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven
personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.

TL;DR: Comparative evaluation of AI-generated gestures in VR vs 2D shows VR provides slightly higher ratings and unique benefits for perception, though model rankings remain consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gestures enhance human communication and virtual avatars use AI-generated gestures for realism, but evaluations have been limited to 2D. VR's immersive nature may affect gesture perception differently.

Method: Comparative evaluation of computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D using three models from the 2023 GENEA Challenge, examining how different viewing environments affect perception.

Result: Gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true movement." Model rankings remained consistent across both settings.

Conclusion: VR influences participants' overall perception of gestures and offers unique benefits over traditional 2D evaluation, suggesting VR provides a more comprehensive assessment environment for gesture evaluation.

Abstract: Gestures are central to human communication, enriching interactions through
non-verbal expression. Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures
to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D.
Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how
gestures are perceived. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D, examining three models from the 2023
GENEA Challenge. Results show that gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly
higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true
movement." While model rankings remained consistent across settings, VR
influenced participants' overall perception and offered unique benefits over
traditional 2D evaluation.

TL;DR: A simple, fully correct replacement for the flawed domain-extension step in a recent quantum lattice algorithm, using a pair-shift difference construction to cancel unknown offsets and produce exact uniform CRT-coset states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The published Step 9 of the windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch that needs to be corrected.

Method: A pair-shift difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces an exact uniform CRT-coset state over Z_P, and uses QFT to enforce the intended modular linear relation.

Result: The proposed unitary is reversible, uses poly(log M_2) gates, and preserves the original algorithm's asymptotics while providing full correctness.

Conclusion: The new construction successfully replaces the contested domain-extension step with a fully correct and assumption-light alternative that maintains the algorithm's efficiency.

Abstract: We give a simple, fully correct, and assumption-light replacement for the
contested "domain-extension" in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice
algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. The published
Step~9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. We present a pair-shift
difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces
an exact uniform CRT-coset state over $\mathbb{Z}_{P}$, and then uses the QFT
to enforce the intended modular linear relation. The unitary is reversible,
uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves the algorithm's

*Titong Jiang,Xuefeng Jiang,Yuan Ma,Xin Wen,Bailin Li,Kun Zhan,Peng Jia,Yahui Liu,Sheng Sun,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LightVLA is a differentiable token pruning framework for vision-language-action models that adaptively prunes visual tokens to reduce computational overhead while improving task performance, achieving 59.1% FLOPs reduction and 2.9% higher success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language-action models face deployment challenges on resource-constrained platforms due to heavy attention computation over large visual token sets, requiring efficient token pruning without performance degradation.

Method: Uses adaptive, performance-driven pruning with dynamic queries to evaluate token importance and Gumbel softmax for differentiable token selection. No heuristic parameters or additional trainable parameters required.

Result: Outperforms existing VLA models and token pruning methods on LIBERO benchmark, reducing FLOPs by 59.1% and latency by 38.2% while improving task success rate by 2.9%.

Conclusion: LightVLA is the first adaptive visual token pruning method for VLA tasks that simultaneously improves efficiency and performance, enabling more practical real-time robotic systems.

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel system for autonomous high-fidelity 3D scanning using sub-100g UAVs with dynamic trajectory adaptation that improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small UAVs have payload and autonomy constraints that prevent complex tasks like high-quality 3D reconstruction, limiting their use in indoor and hard-to-reach areas.

Method: Dual-reconstruction pipeline with real-time feedback: near-RT SfM for instant pointcloud generation and model quality analysis, dynamic trajectory adaptation for capturing poorly covered areas, and non-RT N3DR with NeRF-based reconstruction using SfM camera poses and UWB location data.

Result: Experiments with Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs in single/multi-UAV configurations show dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates a scalable autonomous solution enabling miniaturized UAVs to perform fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to larger platforms.

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

### [186] [ActiveVLN: Towards Active Exploration via Multi-Turn RL in Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12618)
*Zekai Zhang,Weiye Zhu,Hewei Pan,Xiangchen Wang,Rongtao Xu,Xing Sun,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveVLN is a Vision-and-Language Navigation framework that uses multi-turn reinforcement learning for active exploration, achieving better performance than imitation learning and prior RL methods with smaller models and less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods rely heavily on imitation learning with DAgger, which is costly in data collection and training. Prior RL methods lack dynamic environment interaction and depend on expert trajectories, limiting the agent's ability to discover diverse navigation routes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Use a small fraction of expert trajectories for imitation learning to bootstrap the agent. 2) Multi-turn RL where the agent iteratively predicts/executes actions, collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes via GRPO objective. Includes dynamic early-stopping and engineering optimizations.

Result: Achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based methods. Reaches competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model.

Conclusion: ActiveVLN successfully enables active exploration through multi-turn RL, addressing limitations of prior methods while being more efficient and achieving strong performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

*Junlin Song,Antoine Richard,Miguel Olivares-Mendez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel efficient discrete-time method for visual-inertial spatial-temporal calibration that addresses computational cost issues of continuous-time approaches while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-inertial fusion is essential for applications like robot navigation and AR, but existing continuous-time calibration methods suffer from high computational costs. With millions of devices needing calibration, efficiency improvements can save significant time.

Method: Proposes a discrete-time state representation approach for spatial-temporal calibration between IMU and cameras, specifically addressing the temporal calibration weakness of discrete-time methods.

Result: The method achieves extremely efficient calibration while maintaining precision comparable to continuous-time approaches, potentially saving thousands of work days for mass device calibration.

Conclusion: The discrete-time calibration method provides an efficient alternative to continuous-time approaches, benefiting both research and industry communities, with plans to open-source the code.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

*Robin Vujanic,Thomas Rueckstiess*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LEAF is a knowledge distillation framework that creates lightweight text embedding models aligned to teacher models, enabling asymmetric architectures for information retrieval and achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a flexible knowledge distillation framework that produces smaller text embedding models aligned with larger teacher models, enabling efficient asymmetric retrieval architectures while inheriting teacher properties like MRL and quantization robustness.

Method: Knowledge distillation framework that distills teacher model knowledge into smaller leaf models without requiring judgments or hard negatives, using small batch sizes and applicable to black-box models.

Result: Created leaf-ir (23M parameters) that ranks #1 on BEIR benchmark for its size, and leaf-mt that ranks #1 on MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard. Asymmetric mode further improves retrieval performance.

Conclusion: LEAF provides an effective and accessible framework for creating high-performance lightweight text embedding models that inherit teacher capabilities, with minimal dataset and infrastructure requirements, making advanced embedding technology more widely available.

Abstract: We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG frameworks struggle to identify whether retrieved documents meaningfully contribute to answer generation, making it difficult to filter out irrelevant or misleading content that impacts performance.

Method: Introduces DIG metric that computes the difference in LLM's generation confidence with and without document augmentation. Uses DIG scores to train a specialized reranker that prioritizes documents from exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches across various models and benchmarks. Achieves 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% improvements in exact match accuracy on NaturalQA against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG respectively. Average 15.3% increment on GPT-4o across all datasets.

Conclusion: InfoGain-RAG offers a reliable solution for RAG in multiple applications by effectively filtering irrelevant documents and selecting the most valuable ones for better answer generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for chest radiology often neglect patient

introduce MetaCheX, a novel multimodal framework that integrates chest X-ray
images with structured patient metadata to replicate clinical decision-making.
Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with
metadata processed by a multilayer perceptron through a shared classifier.
Evaluated on the CheXpert Plus dataset, MetaCheX consistently outperformed
radiograph-only baseline models across multiple CNN architectures. By
integrating metadata, the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly
improved, measured by an increase in AUROC. The results of this study
demonstrate that metadata reduces algorithmic bias and enhances model
generalizability across diverse patient populations. MetaCheX advances clinical
artificial intelligence toward robust, context-aware radiographic disease

TL;DR: Attention-based framework using DINOv2 for 3D medical image anomaly classification, addressing data scarcity and class imbalance through slice-level attention and composite loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in medical imaging faces challenges from limited annotated data, class imbalance, and high labeling costs. Vision foundation models like DINOv2 offer generalized representations that can help overcome these limitations.

Method: Uses DINOv2 as pretrained feature extractor for 2D axial MRI slices, applies soft attention mechanism for slice-level importance weighting, and employs composite loss with supervised contrastive learning and class-variance regularization.

Result: Validated on ADNI dataset and institutional headache cohort, demonstrating strong anomaly classification performance despite limited data and significant class imbalance.

Conclusion: Pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation are effective for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and classification in medical imaging are critical for
early diagnosis but remain challenging due to limited annotated data, class
imbalance, and the high cost of expert labeling. Emerging vision foundation
models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer
generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations.
In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework
tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging
the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method
processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive
slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further
address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised
contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class
separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI
dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong
anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and
significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing
pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation
for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging. Our implementation

Motivation: Addressing the shortage of ophthalmologists and the time-consuming, error-prone nature of manual retinal image interpretation by automating medical report generation.

Method: Multi-modal deep learning approach capturing text-image interactions, improved medical keyword representation, overcoming RNN limitations for long-range dependencies, and enhancing system interpretability.

Result: State-of-the-art performance achieved through rigorous evaluation using various metrics.

Conclusion: AI has the potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating report generation, improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge
to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the
available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and
treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of
generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation,
which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining
ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal
images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle
patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI
systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis,
reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases.
The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report
generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions
between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive
medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation
enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3)
Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing
long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance
the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust
and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated
using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis
demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by
automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency,
diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MEGAN is a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts trained with diverse ground truths, improving medical AI reliability by addressing inter-rater variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty quantification methods in medical AI rely on single expert annotations, overlooking inter-rater variability which is prevalent in healthcare settings like ulcerative colitis severity assessment.

Method: Proposes MEGAN which uses Evidential Deep Learning models trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies, then aggregates predictions and uncertainties through a gating network for optimal combination.

Result: Achieved 3.5% improvement in F1-score and 30.5% reduction in Expected Calibration Error compared to existing methods in large-scale UC clinical trials, enabling uncertainty-guided sample stratification.

Conclusion: MEGAN enhances prediction confidence and calibration while reducing annotation burden, potentially increasing efficiency and consistency in medical trials by effectively handling inter-rater variability.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI.
Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to
quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods
such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these
methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model
training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address
this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates
uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models
trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating
network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model,
enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively
benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease
severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore
(MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective
UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5%
reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification,
reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and
consistency in UC trials.

### [194] [Universal Gröbner Bases of (Universal) Multiview Ideals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12376)
*Timothy Duff,Jack Kendrick,Rekha R. Thomas*

Main category: math.AC

TL;DR: This paper proves that a natural collection of polynomials forms a universal Gröbner basis for multiview ideals and their universal analogs, using symmetry reduction and induction on an infinite family of ideals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview ideals are fundamental to understanding the geometry of image formation in pinhole cameras, and universal multiview ideals extend this to unknown camera parameters. Establishing universal Gröbner bases provides important algebraic structure for these geometric problems.

Method: The authors use a criterion introduced by Huang and Larson (with proof included) and employ symmetry reduction and induction techniques to handle the infinite family of ideals. They also characterize the underlying matroids that support this methodology.

Result: The paper successfully proves that the natural polynomial collection forms a universal Gröbner basis for both multiview ideals and universal multiview ideals.

Conclusion: This work provides a complete algebraic characterization of multiview ideals through universal Gröbner bases, with the methodology enabled by symmetry and matroid theory, offering tools for further study in computer vision and algebraic geometry.

Abstract: Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole
cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras.
We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gr\"obner
basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and
Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry
reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family
of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the
methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.

### [196] [Yet Another Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12574)
*Siyuan Bao,Ying Shi,Zhiguang Yang,Hanzhou Wu,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel black-box watermarking framework for LLMs that embeds watermarks by manipulating internal parameters, enabling extraction without model access while maintaining text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM watermarking methods lack intrinsic coupling with models, reducing semantic quality. Traditional training-based methods are limited to white-box scenarios or too time-consuming for LLMs with massive parameters.

Method: Embed watermarks by manipulating LLM's internal parameters, allowing watermark extraction from generated text without accessing the LLM itself (black-box scenario).

Result: Experimental results verify feasibility, superiority, and practicality. The method better balances robustness and imperceptibility compared to related approaches.

Conclusion: Provides a new perspective different from mainstream works, offering computationally efficient black-box watermark extraction while maintaining text quality.

Abstract: Existing watermarking methods for large language models (LLMs) mainly embed
watermark by adjusting the token sampling prediction or post-processing,
lacking intrinsic coupling with LLMs, which may significantly reduce the
semantic quality of the generated marked texts. Traditional watermarking
methods based on training or fine-tuning may be extendable to LLMs. However,
most of them are limited to the white-box scenario, or very time-consuming due
to the massive parameters of LLMs. In this paper, we present a new watermarking
framework for LLMs, where the watermark is embedded into the LLM by
manipulating the internal parameters of the LLM, and can be extracted from the
generated text without accessing the LLM. Comparing with related methods, the
proposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the
LLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the
watermark. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to extract the watermark
under the black-box scenario, which is computationally efficient for use.
Experimental results have also verified the feasibility, superiority and
practicality. This work provides a new perspective different from mainstream
works, which may shed light on future research.

### [197] [Jailbreaking Large Language Models Through Content Concretization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12937)
*Johan Wahréus,Ahmed Hussain,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Content Concretization (CC) is a novel jailbreaking technique that transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete implementations through iterative refinement, achieving 62% success rate with minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM safety mechanisms remain vulnerable to circumvention, and existing jailbreaking techniques need improvement in effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) Generate initial responses using lower-tier models with weaker safety filters, 2) Refine through higher-tier models that process both preliminary output and original prompt in iterative cycles.

Result: Achieved 62% jailbreak success rate (up from 7% baseline) after 3 refinement iterations, costing only 7.5¢ per prompt. Outputs rated as more malicious and technically superior across 9 different LLM evaluators.

Conclusion: The technique exposes critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks, demonstrating that iterative refinement can effectively bypass safety measures while maintaining cost efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for task automation
and content generation, yet their safety mechanisms remain vulnerable to
circumvention through different jailbreaking techniques. In this paper, we
introduce \textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique
that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete,
executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating
initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models,
then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary
output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350
cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in
jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\%
after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per
prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms
that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more
malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that
generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal
deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual
improved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical
vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks.

TL;DR: A diffusion model trained only on amplitude data can reconstruct both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities in inline holography, without needing ground-truth phase for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental but ill-posed inverse problem due to nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging, requiring a robust solution that doesn't depend on ground-truth phase data.

Method: Uses a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude with a predictor-corrector sampling framework that employs separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase reconstruction.

Result: The method demonstrates robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging configurations, and modalities, successfully reconstructing complex biological tissue structures using priors trained on simple amplitude data like polystyrene beads.

Conclusion: This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.

Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse
problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent
imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion
model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase
from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework
with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables
complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for
training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and
experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes,
imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups.
Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene
beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures,
highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a
cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in
computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent
imaging applications beyond holography.
