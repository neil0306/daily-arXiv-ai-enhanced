TL;DR: Large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection from speech, showing that proper demonstration selection, reasoning prompts, and fine-tuning methods significantly impact performance, with text-only models matching or exceeding multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer's and related dementias remain undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach that needs effective AI model adaptation.

Method: Evaluated nine text-only and three multimodal audio-text models on DementiaBank speech corpus using various adaptation strategies including in-context learning with different demonstration policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration.

Result: Class-centroid demonstrations achieved highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, token-level fine-tuning produced best scores. Adding classification head improved underperforming models. Fine-tuned audio-text systems performed well but didn't surpass top text-only models.

Conclusion: Model adaptation strategies critically influence speech-based dementia detection, and properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed commercial systems.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RBA framework uses self-synthesis data from teacher LLM and reinforcement learning to improve speech-based LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, outperforming traditional methods and achieving SOTA results on speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech-based LLMs have performance gaps compared to text-based LLMs due to inter-modal discrepancies, especially with dynamic user speech inputs.

Method: Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA) uses self-synthesis methodology with teacher LLM to generate alignment data, then employs reinforcement learning to align SpeechLMs with teacher behavior.

Result: RBA effectively enhances instruction-following capabilities, outperforms conventional distillation baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on spoken QA and speech-to-text translation benchmarks.

Conclusion: RBA framework successfully bridges performance gap between speech and text LLMs using self-generated data and reinforcement learning, demonstrating strong generalization across speech tasks.

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis using fine-tuned Mistral 7B with RAG, generating graph/text summaries with sentiment scores and hierarchical consolidation into comprehensive reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide comprehensive cryptocurrency news analysis that combines graph and text summaries to eliminate LLM hallucinations and offer complementary analytical views.

Method: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM with 4-bit quantization using PEFT/LoRA approach, employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multilevel analysis with graph-based and text-based summaries at different hierarchical levels.

Result: The approach successfully conducts informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights while eliminating problems with large language model hallucinations through knowledge graph representation.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B models are effective for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis, offering complementary graph and text views with reliable sentiment scoring and hierarchical report generation.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

### [4] [The ProLiFIC dataset: Leveraging LLMs to Unveil the Italian Lawmaking Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03528)
*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC is a new event log dataset for Process Mining in legal systems, created from Italian lawmaking data (1987-2022) using LLMs for structuring unstructured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process Mining's application in legal domains is limited by dataset accessibility and quality issues. There's a need for comprehensive legal process datasets to enable effective analysis.

Method: Created ProLiFIC dataset from unstructured data on Italy's Normattiva portal, using large language models (LLMs) to structure the data into a comprehensive event log of Italian lawmaking procedures.

Result: Developed a benchmark dataset covering 35 years of Italian legislative process (1987-2022), enabling preliminary process mining analyses in the legal domain.

Conclusion: ProLiFIC serves as a valuable benchmark for legal process mining and demonstrates the successful integration of LLMs with process mining techniques for legal system analysis.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel multi-modal framework for earnings calls using hierarchical discourse trees with text, audio, and video signals, creating structured embeddings for financial forecasting and other high-stakes communication domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earnings calls contain rich semi-structured financial communication, but existing sentiment analysis systems fail to capture their layered discourse structure and multi-modal nature.

Method: Two-stage transformer architecture: first encodes multi-modal content (text, audio, video) and discourse metadata at node level using contrastive learning, second synthesizes global embedding for entire conference through hierarchical discourse trees.

Result: Embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful representations reflecting affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment, with practical utility for financial forecasting and discourse evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes beyond financial reporting to other high-stakes unscripted communicative domains like tele-medicine, education, and political discourse, offering robust and explainable multi-modal discourse representation.

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Early-SIB model predicts adolescent suicidal ideation from forum posts before explicit disclosure, achieving 0.73 balanced accuracy on Dutch youth forum data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a leading cause of adolescent death, but many cases go undetected due to lack of mental health contact. Social media provides real-time insights into youth struggles.

Method: Transformer-based model that sequentially processes user posts and engagement content to predict future suicidal ideation/behavior posts without using self-disclosure as input.

Result: Achieved 0.73 balanced accuracy for predicting future suicidal ideation and behavior on a Dutch youth forum dataset.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates that social media analysis tools can meaningfully complement traditional suicide prediction methods by detecting risk before explicit disclosure.

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable method for real-time detection of entity-level hallucinations in long-form LLM generations using web-search-annotated datasets and linear probes, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language models can cause serious harm in high-stakes applications like medical and legal domains, but existing detection methods are impractical for real-world use due to limitations with long-form content and high verification costs.

Method: Developed an annotation methodology using web search to label model responses with grounded entity-level hallucinations, then trained efficient hallucination classifiers using linear probes on this dataset. The approach focuses on entity-level hallucinations (names, dates, citations) rather than claim-level.

Result: Classifiers consistently outperformed baselines across four model families, achieving AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B on long-form responses. Also showed improvement in short-form QA and generalized to detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning despite being trained only on entity-level labels.

Conclusion: The work presents a promising scalable approach for real-world hallucination detection, with publicly released datasets enabling reuse across different models despite the initial annotation cost.

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Developed UDIB method using Deterministic Information Bottleneck to improve topic identification for detecting LLM hallucinations, replacing KL divergence with efficient upper bound for better semantic divergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic divergence metrics for detecting LLM confabulations rely on geometric clustering optimized for spatial proximity rather than information-theoretic analysis, creating a disconnect in topic identification.

Method: Transformed Deterministic Information Bottleneck into practical algorithm (UDIB) by substituting intractable KL divergence with computationally efficient upper bound, creating entropy-regularized robust K-means that favors informative clusters.

Result: UDIB generates shared topic representation from prompt-response embeddings that is maximally informative about their relationship, providing superior foundation for semantic divergence metrics.

Conclusion: UDIB offers a principled, more sensitive tool for detecting LLM confabulations by bridging the gap between geometric clustering and information-theoretic analysis through optimized topic identification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-modal question generation system that automatically creates diverse question types from various content formats using RLHF and interactive interface


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of practice materials tailored to abundant educational resources available to learners in the information-rich era

Method: Four-component system: multi-modal input handling, question generation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and end-to-end interactive interface

Result: Developed foundation for automated, scalable, and intelligent question generation that balances resource efficiency, robust functionality, and smooth user experience

Conclusion: The system successfully bridges the gap between available educational resources and tailored practice materials through automated multi-modal question generation

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

### [10] [AR$^2$: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03537)
*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR^2 framework uses adversarial reinforcement learning to train LLMs for better abstraction skills by having a teacher create complex narrative problems while student learns to extract underlying computational kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training for code generation focuses on superficial pattern recognition rather than explicit abstraction training, which is critical for solving complex programming problems.

Method: AR^2 employs a teacher model to transform kernel problems into narrative-rich descriptions while a student coding model learns to extract the underlying computational logic from these complex narratives.

Result: Experimental results show AR^2 substantially improves student model accuracy on previously unseen, challenging programming tasks.

Conclusion: Abstraction is a key skill for enhancing LLM generalization in programming, and explicit training for abstraction through adversarial reinforcement learning significantly improves performance.

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

### [11] [Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03540)
*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs during inference to improve LLM factuality by integrating internal knowledge from LLMs and external information from retrieval sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with factual consistency due to parametric memory limitations, and existing RAG methods treat knowledge as unstructured text, limiting compositional reasoning and factual inconsistency identification.

Method: Extracts seed KG from questions via prompting, iteratively expands using LLM's latent knowledge, and selectively refines through external retrieval to enhance factual coverage and correct inaccuracies.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods on three factual QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

TL;DR: ResearchPulse is an agent-based framework for multi-document scientific inference that extracts and aligns motivation, methods, and results across related papers to reconstruct research development chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding scientific evolution requires structured cross-document reasoning over thematically related research, not just summarizing individual papers.

Method: Agent-based framework with three coordinated agents: Plan Agent for task decomposition, Mmap-Agent for motivation-method mind maps, and Lchart-Agent for experimental line charts synthesis.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment, structural consistency, and visual fidelity despite using 7B-scale agents.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse successfully addresses multi-document scientific inference challenges and provides a citation-aware benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

### [14] [E-ARMOR: Edge case Assessment and Review of Multilingual Optical Character Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03615)
*Aryan Gupta,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Traditional OCR systems like Sprinklr-Edge-OCR outperform large vision-language models in edge deployment due to superior efficiency, lower cost, and better F1 scores despite LVLMs having higher precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of multilingual OCR in noisy real-world images and evaluate whether large vision-language models can outperform traditional OCR systems in resource-constrained edge environments.

Method: Comparative evaluation of 5 state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and 2 traditional OCR systems on a proprietary multilingual dataset with 54 languages, measuring accuracy, semantic consistency, language coverage, computational efficiency, and deployment costs.

Result: Qwen achieved highest precision (0.54) but Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered best overall F1 score (0.46), 35x faster processing (0.17s/image), and 0.01x the cost ($0.006 per 1000 images) compared to LVLMs.

Conclusion: Traditional OCR systems are more optimal for edge deployment than LVLMs due to significantly lower compute requirements, lower latency, and much higher affordability, even in the era of large language models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

TL;DR: LLMs suffer from self-preference bias in evaluation tasks. Lightweight steering vectors can reduce unjustified bias by 97% without retraining, but show instability on legitimate cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs serving as automated evaluators exhibit self-preference bias, favoring their own outputs over others, which undermines fairness and reliability in evaluation pipelines for tasks like preference tuning and model routing.

Method: Introduce a curated dataset distinguishing justified vs unjustified self-preference, and construct steering vectors using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and an optimization-based approach to mitigate bias at inference time without retraining.

Result: Steering vectors reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97%, substantially outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. However, they show instability on legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement cases.

Conclusion: Steering vectors show promise for mitigating self-preference bias but have limitations, as self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions. This motivates the need for more robust interventions as safeguards for LLM-as-judges evaluation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

### [16] [Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03662)
*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study explores relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence and semantic similarity using MIMIC-IV data, finding weak correlation but complementary value for clinical documentation and decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain rich narratives but unstructured format challenges large-scale analysis. Need to understand how standardized concepts relate through co-occurrence and semantic similarity.

Method: Used MIMIC-IV database with Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained embeddings (ClinicalBERT, BioBERT) to analyze co-occurrence patterns and semantic relationships across specialties and time.

Result: Weak correlation between co-occurrence and semantic similarity, but embeddings captured clinically meaningful associations. Embedding suggestions matched later-documented concepts. Clustering revealed coherent clinical themes linked to patient phenotypes and outcomes.

Conclusion: Co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings provide complementary value for improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical relationships, and supporting decision support and phenotyping applications.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

*Parush Gera,Tempestt Neal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLSD uses metric learning with triplet loss for cross-target/domain stance detection, creating a discriminative embedding space to improve performance across different targets and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of stance detection when targets or domains change, where models need to adapt to new contexts without extensive retraining.

Method: Utilizes metric learning with triplet loss to capture semantic similarities between stance targets, constructing a discriminative embedding space for better domain adaptation.

Result: Showed statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across six widely used models in multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: MLSD effectively enhances stance detection across different targets and domains by learning semantic relationships through metric learning, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

### [18] [SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03791)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SiLVERScore is a new embedding-based metric that directly evaluates sign language generation in a joint semantic space, overcoming limitations of back-translation methods that fail to capture multimodal aspects of sign language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for sign language generation rely on back-translation which introduces ambiguity, fails to capture multimodal features (facial expressions, spatial grammar, prosody), and makes it hard to distinguish errors from generation vs translation systems.

Method: Proposed SiLVERScore, a semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space, enabling direct evaluation without back-translation.

Result: On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore achieves near-perfect discrimination (ROC AUC = 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

Conclusion: SiLVERScore provides a robust, semantically-aware evaluation framework that addresses the limitations of existing back-translation methods and effectively captures the multimodal nature of sign language generation.

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

### [19] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs' grounding abilities are evaluated through interactive referential games, revealing that current models diverge from human patterns despite high task success scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks evaluate VLMs in single-turn settings, but grounding is an interactive process requiring ongoing communication to develop shared understanding.

Method: Introduces a four-metric suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, human-likeness) and tests on 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs compared to human dyads.

Result: All three models diverge from human patterns on at least three metrics, with GPT4o-mini being closest overall. Task success scores don't indicate successful grounding, and high image-utterance alignment doesn't predict task success.

Conclusion: The metric suite provides a framework for future VLM grounding research, highlighting the need for better evaluation of interactive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Align-then-Slide framework for evaluating document-level machine translation by aligning source-target sentences and using multi-chunk sliding evaluation, achieving high correlation with human judgments and enabling effective model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods assume sentence-by-sentence alignment, but LLMs produce whole-document outputs that challenge these methods, requiring a new framework for ultra-long document-level machine translation evaluation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Align stage automatically infers sentence-level correspondences and rebuilds target to match source structure; 2) n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage calculates averaged metric scores under 1-4 chunks for multi-granular assessment.

Result: Achieved Pearson correlation of 0.929 with expert MQM rankings on WMT benchmark, closely aligned with human judgments on real-world test set, and enabled effective CPO training and GRPO reward modeling.

Conclusion: The framework provides an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool for document-level machine translation systems, validated through comprehensive experiments and practical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

### [21] [NE-PADD: Leveraging Named Entity Knowledge for Robust Partial Audio Deepfake Detection via Attention Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03829)
*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NE-PADD is a novel method for partial audio deepfake detection that leverages named entity recognition to improve frame-level fake speech localization, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audio deepfake detection operates at sentence level, while partial detection requires frame-level positioning. Semantic information from audio, particularly named entities, remains underexplored in this context.

Method: Uses two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and PADD, with attention fusion and attention transfer mechanisms to combine attention weights and guide PADD with named entity semantics using auxiliary loss.

Result: Experiments on PartialSpoof-NER dataset show the method outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge.

Conclusion: Incorporating named entity knowledge through attention mechanisms significantly improves partial audio deepfake detection performance.

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to understand "Drivelology" - syntactically coherent but pragmatically paradoxical text that requires contextual inference and emotional interpretation, revealing limitations in pragmatic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLMs' ability to comprehend layered semantic meaning in text that appears nonsensical on surface level but contains deeper rhetorical, emotional or moral implications.

Method: Created a diverse benchmark dataset of 1,200+ curated Drivelology examples across multiple languages, with expert annotation and adjudication. Evaluated various LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks.

Result: LLMs consistently failed to grasp Drivelological text, confusing it with shallow nonsense, producing incoherent justifications, and missing implied rhetorical functions.

Conclusion: Statistical fluency in LLMs does not imply cognitive comprehension, revealing a representational gap in pragmatic understanding that challenges current NLP capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing how Chain-of-Thought reasoning affects LLM trustworthiness across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy, finding that while CoT improves some aspects, it introduces new vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in Long-CoT reasoning improving LLM performance, there's limited understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects model trustworthiness across key dimensions.

Method: Comprehensive survey of recent reasoning models and CoT techniques, analyzing studies chronologically with detailed methodology and findings analysis across five trustworthiness dimensions.

Result: Reasoning techniques show promise for enhancing trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation and robustness improvement, but cutting-edge reasoning models often suffer from comparable or greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy.

Conclusion: This work serves as a valuable resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on reasoning trustworthiness progress, highlighting both benefits and vulnerabilities of CoT techniques.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

### [24] [False Sense of Security: Why Probing-based Malicious Input Detection Fails to Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03888)
*Cheng Wang,Zeming Wei,Qin Liu,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probing-based safety detection methods in LLMs fail because they learn superficial patterns (instructional formats and trigger words) rather than semantic harmfulness, leading to poor out-of-distribution performance and false security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically re-examine probing-based approaches for detecting harmful instructions in LLMs, motivated by concerns about poor out-of-distribution performance and the hypothesis that probes learn superficial patterns instead of semantic harmfulness.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments including: comparing performance with simple n-gram methods, using semantically cleaned datasets, and detailed analysis of pattern dependencies to identify what probes actually learn.

Result: Confirmed that probes learn superficial patterns (instructional patterns and trigger words) rather than semantic harmfulness, demonstrating comparable performance to simple n-gram methods and revealing false security in current approaches.

Conclusion: Current probing-based safety detection approaches provide a false sense of security; there is a need to redesign both models and evaluation protocols for more responsible research in LLM safety detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MobileRAG is a mobile agent framework that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to improve smartphone task automation by addressing LLM limitations in comprehension, environmental interaction, and memory capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based mobile agents suffer from three main issues: reliance on LLM comprehension leading to errors, lack of environmental interaction causing task termination, and absence of memory capabilities requiring task reconstruction.

Method: Proposed MobileRAG framework with three components: InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG, leveraging RAG technology to better identify user queries and handle complex mobile tasks. Also introduced MobileRAG-Eval benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: Achieved 10.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps on the challenging MobileRAG-Eval benchmark, demonstrating effective handling of real-world mobile tasks.

Conclusion: MobileRAG successfully addresses current mobile agent limitations through RAG enhancement, providing more accurate and efficient smartphone task automation with better environmental interaction and memory capabilities.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Matrix of Thought (MoT) framework for complex QA that enhances LLM reasoning through multi-dimensional thinking and fact-correction mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods (CoT, ToT, RAG) in handling complex QA tasks where LLMs suffer from insufficient reasoning capabilities, redundancy in tree structures, and ineffective utilization of multi-hop information.

Method: Develops Matrix of Thought (MoT) with column-cell communication for horizontal/vertical problem exploration, plus fact-correction mechanism using knowledge units from KG triples and raw text to enhance reasoning accuracy.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods on four datasets in F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4% of baseline methods, demonstrating both efficiency and accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: MoT framework provides an efficient and accurate solution for complex QA by enabling multi-strategy deep thinking and effective knowledge utilization, significantly enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KPoEM is a novel Korean poetry emotion dataset with 7,662 entries annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories, enabling state-of-the-art emotion classification in Korean poetry through specialized fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Korean poetry remains underexplored in computational emotion analysis due to its figurative language and cultural specificity, despite progress in general text emotion classification.

Method: Built a multi-label emotion dataset of 7,662 entries (line-level and work-level) from 483 poems by five Korean poets, annotated with 44 emotion categories. Used sequential fine-tuning of Korean language models - first on general corpora then on KPoEM dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned model achieved 0.60 F1-micro score, significantly outperforming previous models trained on general corpora (0.34 F1-micro). The model shows enhanced ability to identify culturally specific emotional expressions while preserving core sentiments.

Conclusion: KPoEM bridges computational methods and literary analysis, enabling quantitative exploration of poetic emotions while retaining emotional and cultural nuances of Korean literature.

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SelfAug is a self-distribution alignment method that mitigates catastrophic forgetting in LLM fine-tuning by aligning input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution, achieving better balance between downstream performance and general capability retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning in RAG scenarios often causes catastrophic forgetting where models lose previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Existing solutions require general instruction data or fail to preserve the model's original distribution.

Method: Proposes SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution during fine-tuning, without requiring external general instruction data.

Result: Extensive experiments show SelfAug achieves superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Analysis reveals direct correlation between distribution shifts and catastrophic forgetting severity in RAG scenarios.

Conclusion: SelfAug advances understanding of catastrophic forgetting in RAG contexts and provides a practical solution applicable across diverse fine-tuning scenarios, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL improves self-play fine-tuning for Text-to-SQL by adding verification-based iterative fine-tuning and error-driven loss to handle opponent model errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN faces challenges in Text-to-SQL tasks because it doesn't generate new information and correct SQL queries from opponent models reduce the main model's accuracy.

Method: Introduces verification-based iterative fine-tuning before self-play to create high-quality data and build models with varying capabilities. During self-play, uses error-driven loss to focus on opponent's incorrect outputs, helping the main model distinguish between correct and erroneous SQL.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on six LLMs and five benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL effectively addresses SPIN's limitations in Text-to-SQL by enhancing data quality and error handling during self-play fine-tuning.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating speech-based role-playing conversational agents, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation and paralinguistic feature consideration in current research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RPCA research focuses only on text modality and overlooks critical paralinguistic features like intonation and prosody. There's also a lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for speech-based role-playing, with existing datasets failing to quantify core competencies like long-term persona consistency.

Method: The authors introduce VoxRole benchmark comprising 13,335 multi-turn dialogues (65.6 hours of speech) from 1,228 characters across 261 movies. They developed a novel two-stage automated pipeline: first aligning movie audio with scripts, then using LLMs to systematically build multi-dimensional character profiles.

Result: The benchmark enables multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Conclusion: VoxRole addresses critical gaps in speech-based RPCA evaluation by providing the first comprehensive benchmark that incorporates paralinguistic features and enables standardized assessment of persona consistency in spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

TL;DR: CANDY benchmark evaluates LLMs for Chinese misinformation fact-checking, finding current models unreliable alone but potentially useful as assistive tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess LLMs' capabilities and limitations in fact-checking Chinese misinformation, as their effectiveness remains uncertain despite growing use.

Method: Created CANDY benchmark with ~20k annotated instances, tested LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting, developed taxonomy to categorize flawed explanations.

Result: Current LLMs show limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, with factual fabrication being the most common failure mode. LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking.

Conclusion: While LLMs are not reliable standalone fact-checkers, they have considerable potential to augment human performance when used as assistive tools in fact-checking scenarios.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of NLP resources for low-resource languages like Ladin by creating synthetic sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets through translation and rigorous filtering, which also improves machine translation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly on extremely low-resource languages like indigenous languages due to lack of labeled data. Ladin, an endangered Romance language, has limited high-quality NLP datasets, making it difficult to develop robust language technologies.

Method: Leveraged parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs to create synthetic datasets by translating monolingual Italian data for sentiment analysis and MCQA. Applied rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures to ensure linguistic quality and reliability.

Result: Incorporating synthetic datasets into machine translation training led to substantial improvements over existing Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Created the first publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the data scarcity problem for low-resource languages like Ladin, establishing foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream applications for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

TL;DR: RTQA is a novel framework that enhances temporal knowledge graph question answering through recursive decomposition and multi-path aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex temporal queries without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TKGQA methods struggle with complex temporal queries, limited reasoning abilities, and error propagation in decomposition frameworks, lacking capability for handling implicit temporal constraints.

Method: RTQA uses recursive thinking to decompose questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation for fault tolerance. It consists of three components: Temporal Question Decomposer, Recursive Solver, and Answer Aggregator.

Result: Experiments on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks show significant Hits@1 improvements in 'Multiple' and 'Complex' categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RTQA effectively addresses limitations in current TKGQA methods by providing enhanced reasoning capabilities without training requirements, demonstrating superior performance on complex temporal queries through recursive decomposition and aggregation techniques.

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [35] [On Robustness and Reliability of Benchmark-Based Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04013)
*Riccardo Lunardi,Vincenzo Della Mea,Stefano Mizzaro,Kevin Roitero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant performance drops when benchmark questions are paraphrased, challenging the reliability of standard evaluations and highlighting robustness issues with linguistic variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether benchmark-based evaluations provide reliable measures of LLM capabilities in real-world scenarios where questions appear in diverse linguistic forms rather than fixed standardized formats.

Method: Systematically generated various paraphrases of all questions across six common benchmarks and measured effectiveness variations across 34 state-of-the-art LLMs of different sizes and capabilities.

Result: While LLM rankings remained relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores changed significantly and declined, showing models struggle with linguistic variability.

Conclusion: Standard benchmark evaluations may not fully capture model robustness, necessitating the development of robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect real-world deployment scenarios with linguistic variations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models show increasing cross-lingual consistency as they grow larger and more capable, with self-consistency across languages exceeding inter-model agreement within the same language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how similar model outputs are across different languages and evaluate multilingual reliability using a novel similarity metric.

Method: Applied the κ_p similarity metric to analyze 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU, comparing model responses across languages and between different models.

Result: Model responses become more consistent across languages as model size and capability increase. Models show greater cross-lingual consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the same language.

Conclusion: κ_p is a valuable tool for evaluating multilingual reliability and can guide development of more consistent multilingual systems, demonstrating that larger models achieve better cross-lingual consistency.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First automated Chinese functional syntax annotation system using RoBERTa, achieving 0.852 F1 score for identifying syntactic elements like Subject, Main Verb, and Complement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existing automatic annotation system for Chinese texts based on Systemic Functional Grammar/Cardiff Grammar, limiting theory application and promotion.

Method: Fine-tuned RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model on 4,100 annotated sentences from People's Daily 2014 corpus for named entity recognition of syntactic elements.

Result: Achieved 0.852 F1 score on test set, significantly outperforming other models, with excellent performance on core elements (S, M, C) but room for improvement on imbalanced labels.

Conclusion: First integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, providing new method for automated Chinese functional syntax analysis and foundation for future research.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

TL;DR: Synthesized sheet music problems based on music theory to create evaluation benchmarks and training data for LLMs/MLLMs, improving sheet music reasoning and enabling AI-assisted music creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks both evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning, which is crucial for building AI musicians with proper music interpretation capabilities.

Method: Proposed a data synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in textual and visual modalities, creating SSMR-Bench benchmark and training data for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: Qwen3-8B-Base surpassed GPT-4 on MusicTheoryBench and achieved comparable reasoning to GPT-4 with strategies. Models showed improved sheet music interpretation and enhanced math problem performance. Gemini 2.5-Pro performed poorly on visual sheet music interpretation.

Conclusion: First to synthesize sheet music problems based on music theory rules, demonstrating effectiveness in advancing model reasoning for sheet music understanding and unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted music creation.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting subtle phrasing and hidden agendas in news content, making it difficult to analyze bias and sentiment through covert narratives and implicit messaging.

Method: Fine-tune BERT model with recall-oriented approach for narrative detection, then use GPT-4o pipeline with ReACT framework and semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting for explanations. Incorporate structured taxonomy table as auxiliary knowledge base to reduce hallucinations.

Result: Integration of auxiliary knowledge in prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability. The system effectively handles multi-label classification of narratives and generates concise, evidence-based explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses challenges in covert narrative analysis with applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering, demonstrating improved factual accuracy and reduced hallucinations through structured knowledge integration.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how to create stable, personalized lexical profiles from minimal spoken data (10 minutes) to enable lexical alignment in conversational agents, finding optimal profiles with 5 adjectives/conjunctions and 10 adverbs/nouns/pronouns/verbs each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lexical alignment improves human communication but remains underexplored in conversational agents despite recent LLM advancements. The research aims to enable lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue by developing personalized lexical profiles.

Method: Varied amounts of transcribed spoken data and number of items per POS category to construct lexical profiles. Evaluated profile performance over time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics.

Result: Smaller, more compact profiles created from 10 min of transcribed speech (5 adjectives/conjunctions, 10 adverbs/nouns/pronouns/verbs each) offered the best balance of performance and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for constructing stable lexical profiles with minimal data requirements, serving as a foundation for implementing lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Joint modeling of entity and discourse relation features significantly improves coherence assessment performance compared to using either feature type alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing coherence modeling work focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse relation features, with little attention to combining both approaches for comprehensive coherence assessment.

Method: Explored two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations for coherence assessment, integrating both types of features in the modeling process.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that integrating both entity and discourse relation features significantly enhances the performance of coherence models.

Conclusion: Modeling both entity features and discourse relations simultaneously provides substantial benefits for coherence evaluation, highlighting the importance of combining these complementary linguistic features.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing need for scalable psychological counseling with privacy-compliant data, but high-quality synthetic data for fine-tuning LLMs remains scarce. Existing single-agent approaches fail to capture the structure and nuance of real counseling sessions.

Method: Multi-agent framework where specialized LLM agents handle different psychological techniques as coordinated sub-tasks. Also introduces a unified evaluation framework with nine expert evaluation aspects and diverse automatic metrics.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods - improves general counseling skills by 3.2% and CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on CTRS. Experts prefer MAGneT sessions in 77.2% of cases. Fine-tuning on MAGneT data shows 6.3% improvement on general skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills.

Conclusion: MAGneT provides a superior approach for generating high-quality synthetic psychological counseling data, enabling better fine-tuning of open-source LLMs for scalable mental health applications while addressing evaluation inconsistencies in prior work.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug is a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework that combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to improve social event detection without costly manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social event detection from social media relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and labor-intensive, creating a need for automated data augmentation solutions.

Method: Combines explicit text augmentation using large language models with five generation strategies, and implicit feature-space augmentation with five novel perturbation techniques on structural fused embeddings that preserve semantic and relational properties.

Result: Outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on Twitter2012 and 15.57% on Twitter2018 datasets in terms of average F1 score.

Conclusion: SED-Aug effectively enhances data diversity and model robustness for social event detection through dual augmentation approach, significantly improving performance over existing baselines.

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Inverse IFEval benchmark evaluates LLMs' counter-intuitive ability to override training biases and follow adversarial instructions, revealing cognitive inertia issues in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with cognitive inertia - they fail to follow instructions that conflict with standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning, limiting their real-world adaptability.

Method: Proposed Inverse IFEval benchmark with 8 challenge types (Question Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, etc.), created 1012 high-quality Chinese/English questions across 23 domains using human-in-the-loop pipeline, evaluated using optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework.

Result: Experiments on leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of the benchmark, showing models struggle with counter-intuitive instructions despite strong performance on standard tasks.

Conclusion: Future alignment efforts should focus not just on fluency and factual correctness but also adaptability in unconventional contexts. Inverse IFEval serves as diagnostic tool and foundation for methods that mitigate cognitive inertia and enhance instruction-following reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

*Juraj Vladika,Mahdi Dhaini,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in healthcare risk providing outdated medical advice due to static training data. Researchers created MedRevQA and MedChangeQA datasets to evaluate this problem, finding all tested LLMs rely on obsolete knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of LLMs providing harmful outdated medical recommendations as medical knowledge evolves, which could lead to clinical reasoning failures.

Method: Created two novel QA datasets from systematic reviews: MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs) and MedChangeQA (512 QA pairs tracking medical consensus changes). Evaluated eight prominent LLMs on these datasets and analyzed influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies.

Result: All eight tested LLMs showed consistent reliance on outdated medical knowledge across both datasets, demonstrating the widespread nature of this problem.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical need for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems that can adapt to evolving medical knowledge, and provides groundwork for future mitigation strategies.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO improves contextual ASR by addressing homophone recognition issues through phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive disambiguation, and hierarchical filtering, achieving significant performance gains on both Chinese and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with domain-specific named entities and homophones, with existing contextual methods failing to capture fine-grained phoneme variations and treating entities as independent tokens, leading to incomplete multi-token biasing.

Method: Proposes PARCO framework with four key components: phoneme-aware encoding for better phonetic discrimination, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision for complete entity retrieval, and hierarchical entity filtering to reduce false positives.

Result: Achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. Also shows robust gains on out-of-domain datasets THCHS-30 and LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: PARCO effectively addresses homophone recognition challenges in contextual ASR through integrated phoneme-aware and contrastive learning approaches, demonstrating strong performance improvements across multiple languages and domains.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

### [49] [Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04373)
*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM gender bias evaluations are highly sensitive to prompt design - minor changes can substantially alter or even reverse bias outcomes, raising questions about ecological validity of benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in socially impactful settings, there are growing concerns about gender bias and efforts to measure/mitigate it, but current evaluation methods may not reflect natural language distributions.

Method: Tested models under different prompt conditions that make testing context and gender-focused content salient, using four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics.

Result: Even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias outcomes, sometimes reversing direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures.

Conclusion: Findings highlight brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations and raise important questions about whether well-controlled testing designs trigger "testing mode" performance, affecting ecological validity of benchmarks.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

*Mutsumi Sasaki,Go Kamoda,Ryosuke Takahashi,Kosuke Sato,Kentaro Inui,Keisuke Sakaguchi,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of language models' ability to handle Japanese calendar tasks, showing that even Japanese-centric models struggle with calendar arithmetic and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work on temporal reasoning in LMs has focused only on Gregorian calendar, ignoring culturally important non-Gregorian systems like Japanese calendar that are actively used.

Method: Created datasets for four tasks requiring temporal knowledge and reasoning, evaluated range of English-centric and Japanese-centric language models on Japanese calendar handling.

Result: Some models can perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with Japanese-calendar arithmetic and maintaining consistency across calendars.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of developing LMs better equipped for culture-specific calendar understanding beyond just Gregorian systems.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFP framework replaces low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction for efficient masked skeleton modeling, achieving faster training and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked autoencoder approaches for skeleton-based action recognition use simple reconstruction targets like raw joint coordinates, causing computational redundancy and limited semantic representation.

Method: Proposes General Feature Prediction (GFP) framework with collaborative learning using a lightweight target generation network that produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, incorporating constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity.

Result: Achieves 6.2x faster training than standard methods and state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: High-level feature prediction is more effective than low-level reconstruction for masked skeleton modeling, providing both computational efficiency and superior representation quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based mitosis detection using teacher-student UNet with domain generalization to address domain shift and data imbalance, achieving F1 score 0.7660 for detection and balanced accuracy 0.8414 for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual mitosis counting is time-consuming and suffers from inter-observer variability. AI solutions face challenges with domain shift (differences in organs, species, staining protocols) and severe data imbalance between mitotic figures and normal nuclei.

Method: Pixel-level segmentation approach using UNet backbone with domain generalization modules (contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training). Teacher-student strategy generates pseudo-masks for mitoses, hard negatives, and normal nuclei. Multi-scale CNN classifier leverages segmentation features in multi-task learning.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection (Track 1) and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification (Track 2) on preliminary test set.

Conclusion: The integrated segmentation-based detection and classification framework effectively addresses domain shift and data imbalance, demonstrating robust performance for automated mitosis analysis.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM is a two-stage framework that addresses multiple overlapping biases in vision models by first learning to recognize biases through adaptive integration, then pruning bias directions via gradient suppression, achieving improved robustness and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images contain multiple overlapping biases that collectively impair vision model performance, and addressing biases individually is inadequate as mitigating one bias often intensifies others.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning trains encoders for each attribute and integrates them with main backbone to explicitly recognize biases; 2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning prunes bias directions from backbone's gradients.

Result: Validated on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO datasets - boosted worst group accuracy, halved multi-attribute bias amplification, and set new low in Scaled Bias Amplification metric despite increasing bias complexity and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: GMBM is the first practical, end-to-end multi-bias solution for visual recognition that effectively handles multiple overlapping biases while requiring group labels only during training.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

TL;DR: Lightweight U-Net achieves equivalent cardiac segmentation performance to nnU-Net with 16x smaller size and 4x faster speed through optimized components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time clinical measurements from echocardiography by addressing the limitations of large, slow nnU-Net models for left ventricle segmentation.

Method: Conducted ablation study to identify most effective nnU-Net components, then developed lightweight U-Net with simplified augmentations and deep supervision.

Result: Achieved statistically equivalent Dice scores (0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89) with 2M vs 33M parameters, 16x smaller and 4x faster (1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame).

Conclusion: Simple affine augmentations and deep supervision are key drivers of performance, enabling efficient real-time cardiac segmentation without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Revised treeX algorithm for unsupervised tree instance segmentation from laser scanning data, offering improved performance and efficiency compared to original treeX and deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for tree instance segmentation require large annotated datasets and substantial computational resources, creating need for resource-efficient alternatives.

Method: Unsupervised method combining clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation, with parameter presets for ground-based (TLS/PLS) and UAV-borne (ULS) laser scanning data.

Result: Reduces runtime and improves accuracy over original treeX, with F1-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data. Achieves F1-score of 0.58 for ULS data where original algorithm failed. Matches accuracy of recent open-source deep learning methods for TLS/PLS data.

Conclusion: Provides resource-efficient alternative to deep learning for scenarios with sufficient stem visibility and point density, and enables semi-automatic label generation for deep learning models. Open-source Python implementation available.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D is a novel framework that uses geometric reconstruction tasks to improve 3D scene understanding in multimodal models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LMMs excel at 2D visual understanding but struggle with 3D scene understanding due to reliance on text-only supervision, which lacks geometric constraints needed for robust spatial representations.

Method: Reg3D uses a dual-supervision paradigm with complementary object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder architecture, incorporating 3D geometric information as both input and explicit learning targets.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models by enforcing geometric consistency through reconstruction tasks, enabling better 3D spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

TL;DR: QuantV2X is the first fully quantized multi-agent system for V2X cooperative perception that reduces computational and transmission costs while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X cooperative perception systems focus on accuracy but neglect efficiency, latency, and real-world deployability. Full-precision models have high computational and transmission costs that make them impractical for resource-constrained real-time environments.

Method: Introduces a unified end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and transmitted message representations to simultaneously reduce computational load and transmission bandwidth.

Result: QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems while reducing system-level latency by 3.2x and achieving +9.5 improvement in mAP30 over full-precision baselines. It also scales more effectively within strict memory budgets.

Conclusion: QuantV2X demonstrates the viability of fully quantized multi-agent intermediate fusion systems for real-world deployment, offering efficient and scalable V2X cooperative perception.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system

### [59] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN is an efficient graph similarity method for floor plan layouts that delays cross-graph interactions to the end, using differentiable graph kernels for faster inference while maintaining comparable accuracy to graph matching networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph matching networks for floor plan comparison rely on costly intermediate cross-graph node interactions, making them slow for inference. There's a need for more efficient methods that maintain accuracy while improving speed.

Method: LayoutGKN postpones cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint embedding architecture and uses a differentiable graph kernel as a distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings.

Result: LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks while significantly increasing inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed LayoutGKN approach provides an efficient alternative to traditional graph matching networks for floor plan graph comparison, achieving similar or better accuracy with substantially faster performance.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD is a parameter-efficient adaptation method that uses SVD to fine-tune only singular values of CLIP's parameter matrices, achieving state-of-the-art performance with just 0.04% parameters while preserving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting VLMs like CLIP to fine-grained domains is challenging due to reliance on prompt engineering and costly full fine-tuning. Existing methods with additional components limit adaptation quality and compromise pretrained knowledge.

Method: Leverages Singular Value Decomposition to modify CLIP's internal parameter space without adding modules. Only fine-tunes singular values to rescale basis vectors while retaining the pretrained model structure.

Result: Achieves SOTA classification on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets. Outperforms previous methods in accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings using only 0.04% of total parameters.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD provides an effective, parameter-efficient adaptation technique that preserves model generalization while enabling interpretable adaptation through natural language analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly

*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed STA-Net with Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) for edge-based plant disease diagnosis, achieving 89% accuracy with only 401K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying high-precision plant disease diagnosis models on edge devices, as existing attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition fail to capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex textures.

Method: Twofold approach: 1) Training-free neural architecture search (DeepMAD) for efficient network backbone, 2) Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) with decoupled attention - deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and Gabor filter bank for texture awareness.

Result: STA-Net achieved 89.00% accuracy and 88.96% F1 score on CCMT plant disease dataset with only 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs. Ablation studies confirmed STAM significantly outperforms baseline and standard attention models.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge through decoupled attention mechanisms provides an effective approach for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI, enabling accurate plant disease diagnosis on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces DeepCamo dataset and SLENet framework for underwater camouflaged object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance through semantic localization and enhancement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged object detection is critical for marine ecology but remains underexplored due to optical distortions, water turbidity, and complex marine organism traits that hinder accurate identification.

Method: Proposes SLENet framework with Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement module and Localization Guidance Branch to enhance multi-scale features and generate semantic-rich location maps, guided by Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder for accurate predictions.

Result: Experiments on DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets demonstrate SLENet's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with high generality for broader COD tasks.

Conclusion: SLENet effectively addresses underwater camouflaged object detection challenges and shows strong generalization capabilities across different camouflaged object detection scenarios.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [63] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple training strategy that leverages temporal coherence in video frames to improve diffusion model training, achieving 2x faster convergence and better performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models are trained on static images, which is information-deficient for capturing temporal dynamics, leading to slower convergence, limited distributional coverage, and reduced generalization.

Method: Proposes a training strategy that utilizes temporal inductive bias from continuous video frames, requiring no architectural modifications and being seamlessly integrable into standard diffusion training pipelines.

Result: Achieves over 2x faster convergence, lower FID on both training and validation distributions, improved generative diversity, and reduced gradient variance contributing to faster optimization.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal coherence in video frames provides an effective regularization that improves diffusion model training efficiency and performance without requiring architectural changes.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D is a multi-scale vision-language framework for 3D CT analysis that addresses radiologic diagnostic errors through joint local-global understanding and semantic-enriched report alignment, achieving SOTA performance on multiple medical vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologic diagnostic errors remain prevalent due to missed localized abnormalities, limited global context in 3D imaging, and variability in report language. Existing 3D vision-language models cannot jointly address precise detection, global reasoning, and consistent reporting needs.

Method: MedVista3D performs multi-scale local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. It uses language model rewrites and a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank to handle report variability and enable semantics-aware alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering. Also transfers well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MedVista3D effectively addresses key challenges in 3D radiology analysis through joint local-global understanding and semantic-enriched alignment, demonstrating strong performance across multiple medical vision tasks with good transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [65] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL is a causality-guided text prompt learning method that uses visual granulation to improve CLIP's performance on fine-grained recognition tasks by capturing subtle class differences through causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods show limited ability in handling fine-grained datasets, as they struggle to capture subtle discrepancies between similar classes.

Method: Two modules: (1) Attribute disentanglement module using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model to decompose visual features into shared and class-specific attributes; (2) Granule learning module that constructs visual granules by integrating attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show CaPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, particularly on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed causality-guided approach with visual granulation effectively captures fine-grained distinctions, leading to more discriminative text prompts and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EGTM framework using event cameras for turbulence mitigation, achieving 710x smaller model size and 214x faster inference while improving restoration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning turbulence mitigation methods require high-capacity networks and struggle with computational efficiency due to limited frame-rate and coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames.

Method: Introduces 'event-lucky insight' to correlate turbulence distortions with event stream distribution, then proposes EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level turbulence-free guidance from turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion.

Result: Surpasses existing SOTA by 710x in model size, 214x in inference latency, 224x in model complexity, while achieving +0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM improvement on real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Event cameras provide great efficiency merit for turbulence mitigation tasks, demonstrating the advantage of introducing event modality with microsecond-level temporal resolution.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba is an RGB-Event detection method that performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy by focusing on informative regions and efficiently integrating complementary information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process low-information regions uniformly, leading to high computational costs and suboptimal performance. Fixed token sparsification methods fail to adapt to varying sample complexity.

Method: Proposes Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) to identify and adaptively discard low-information regions using event camera scene changes, and Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) to integrate complementary features.

Result: Experiments on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets show superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FocusMamba achieves better balance between accuracy and efficiency through adaptive collaborative sparsification and effective multimodal fusion, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: Proposes SalientFusion for Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition, addressing background redundancy, role confusion, and semantic bias through SalientFormer and DebiasAT components, achieving SOTA results on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition needs methods for unseen categories, but faces challenges with background distraction, dish role confusion, and semantic bias in zero-shot learning.

Method: SalientFusion with two components: SalientFormer removes background redundancy using depth features to resolve role confusion; DebiasAT reduces semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on proposed benchmarks CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, and performs best on general CZSL datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key challenges in compositional zero-shot food recognition and demonstrates superior performance on both food-specific and general benchmarks.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccTENS is a generative occupancy world model that uses temporal next-scale prediction to enable efficient, high-fidelity long-term 3D occupancy generation with improved controllability over ego-motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive approaches for occupancy world modeling suffer from inefficiency, temporal degradation in long-term generation, and lack of controllability over vehicle movement.

Method: Reformulates occupancy modeling as temporal next-scale prediction task, uses TensFormer architecture to manage temporal causality and spatial relationships, and implements holistic pose aggregation for unified occupancy and ego-motion sequence modeling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

Conclusion: OccTENS provides an effective solution for controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object function guides correspondences as functional parts share shape/appearance similarities, enabling better cross-category matching for tasks like shape reconstruction and robot manipulation.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images for functional parts, then integrate with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill functional and spatial knowledge.

Result: Outperforms baseline solutions using off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models on synthetic and real evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully establishes dense functional correspondence by combining functional part identification through vision-language models with spatial learning via contrastive methods.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP excel in zero-shot recognition but struggle with few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline fine-tuning that risks overfitting.

Method: Proposes a dual attention mechanism with Memory Attn-Adapter (refines category embeddings using support examples) and Local-Global Attn-Adapter (enriches image embeddings by integrating local and global features).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization while maintaining efficient inference and scaling across CLIP backbones.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter enables dynamic adaptation from few labeled samples without retraining the base model, providing an effective solution for few-shot learning challenges in vision-language models.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and

### [73] [SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897)
*Xiaofu Chen,Israfel Salazar,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECS is a new reference-free evaluation metric for long image captions that combines CLIP's efficiency with improved specificity scoring, matching LLM-based metric performance at much lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for long image captions have limitations: n-gram metrics lack semantic understanding, representational similarity metrics have poor human correlation, and LLM-based metrics are too expensive for iterative development.

Method: SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity - rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones in long image captions, creating a reference-free representational similarity metric.

Result: SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments while being significantly more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SPECS provides a practical, efficient alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development, balancing performance with computational feasibility.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Conclusion: Generative foundation models like ChexGen play a transformative role in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

### [75] [LMVC: An End-to-End Learned Multiview Video Coding Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03922)
*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding framework that leverages inter-view motion and content correlations to significantly improve compression efficiency while maintaining random access and backward compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview video enables immersive 3D scene reconstruction but has massive data volume requiring efficient compression. Traditional deep learning video coding focuses on single-view/stereo, leaving multiview scenarios underexplored.

Method: Feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction using decoded independent-view motion features, inter-view motion entropy model, disparity-free inter-view context prediction from independent-view content features, and inter-view contextual entropy model.

Result: Outperforms traditional MV-HEVC standard reference software by a large margin in compression efficiency.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong baseline for learned multiview video coding research, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods through effective exploitation of inter-view correlations.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt is a novel framework for topological refinement of 3D tubular anatomical structures that addresses limitations of existing methods by using holistic modeling, topological integrity constraints, and curriculum refinement to achieve significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and topological correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing 3D tubular anatomical structures rely on voxel-wise overlap measures that fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Current topology-aware approaches are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors during inference.

Method: TopoSculpt employs: (i) holistic whole-region modeling to capture full spatial context, (ii) a novel Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements: β₀ errors reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on Circle of Willis dataset. Tree length detected and branch detected rates improved by nearly 10%, demonstrating effectiveness in correcting critical topological errors.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively advances high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy by addressing both geometric and topological challenges, making it suitable for applications like bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial connectivity assessment.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pneumothorax can be life-threatening if undetected, and small cases may be subtle on chest X-rays, requiring automated detection to support radiologists.

Method: U-Net architecture with EfficientNet-B4 encoder, trained on SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and combined binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss.

Result: Achieved IoU of 0.7008 and Dice score of 0.8241 on independent PTX-498 dataset, demonstrating accurate localization of pneumothorax regions.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning model can accurately segment pneumothorax regions from chest X-rays and has potential to support radiologists in clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

### [78] [ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951)
*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANTS uses MLLMs to create adaptive negative textual spaces for improved OOD detection, reducing FPR95 by 4.2% on ImageNet without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods lack understanding of OOD images and suffer from false negative labels that degrade near-OOD performance.

Method: Leverage MLLMs to generate expressive negative sentences from identified OOD images, create visually similar negative labels for near-OOD cases, and use adaptive weighted scoring to balance different OOD settings.

Result: Significantly reduces FPR95 by 4.2% on ImageNet benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ANTS provides training-free, zero-shot OOD detection with high scalability and adaptability to both near and far-OOD settings without task-specific prior knowledge.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMChange is a multimodal remote sensing change detection method that combines image and text modalities to improve accuracy and robustness by addressing limitations of image-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods for remote sensing change detection rely solely on image modality, which limits feature representation, change pattern modeling, and generalization under illumination and noise disturbances.

Method: Proposes MMChange with three key modules: Image Feature Refinement (IFR) to highlight key regions and suppress noise, vision language model (VLM) to generate semantic descriptions, Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) to capture semantic shifts, and Image-Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) for cross-modal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD datasets demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach effectively enhances remote sensing change detection by combining image and text modalities, validating its effectiveness for robust change detection in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL is a novel WSI classification method that uses spatial-aware positional encoding and MLP-based full instance correlation to achieve state-of-the-art performance with linear time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Transformer-based methods for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, which require custom CUDA kernels and struggle with spatial relationships and length extrapolation issues.

Method: Uses a positional encoding module that encodes spatial coordinates instead of sequence indices, and an SAC block (MLP-based) that performs full instance correlations in linear time complexity without requiring custom CUDA kernels.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL provides an efficient and easily deployable alternative to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification, handling spatial relationships and sequence length variations effectively.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning framework for liver vessel segmentation in non-contrast MRI using auxiliary contrast-enhanced data during training to reduce annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver vessel segmentation is crucial for analyzing vascular changes in liver diseases, but existing methods require contrast-enhanced MRI which is not always available. Non-contrast MRI is more common but challenging to segment without large annotated datasets.

Method: Proposes a multi-task learning framework that leverages paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI data (with and without vessel annotations) during training. The approach uses auxiliary contrast-enhanced data to improve feature representation through shared task structure.

Result: Auxiliary contrast-enhanced data improves vessel segmentation accuracy in non-contrast MRI, even when not available during inference. Benefits are most significant when few annotations are available for training. The approach was also validated for brain tumor segmentation, showing cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: An auxiliary informative imaging modality can effectively augment expert annotations and improve segmentation performance even when only available during training, reducing the need for large-scale annotated datasets.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt phrasing significantly affects LMM performance in MCQA, with up to 15% accuracy variations. Promptception framework evaluates 10 LMMs across 61 prompt types, revealing proprietary models are more sensitive to phrasing while open-source models are steadier but struggle with complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design for Large Multimodal Models in Multiple-Choice Question Answering remains poorly understood, and minor prompt variations can cause significant accuracy deviations, posing challenges for fair LMM evaluation.

Method: Introduce Promptception framework with 61 prompt types across 15 categories and 6 supercategories to evaluate prompt sensitivity in 10 LMMs across 3 MCQA benchmarks (MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench).

Result: Proprietary models show greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing (reflecting tighter instruction alignment), while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing.

Conclusion: Propose tailored Prompting Principles for proprietary and open-source LMMs to enable more robust and fair model evaluation.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliceSemOcc is a novel 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework that addresses limitations in height-axis feature processing through vertical slice extraction and SEAttention3D module for dynamic height-wise channel attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods overlook height-axis information and use uniform channel attention across all height layers, limiting their ability to capture semantic variations along the vertical dimension.

Method: Proposes SliceSemOcc with vertical slice feature extraction (global and local), global-local fusion module, and SEAttention3D module that preserves height-wise resolution and assigns dynamic channel attention weights per height layer.

Result: Significant improvement in mean IoU on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets, with especially pronounced gains on small-object categories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances 3D semantic occupancy prediction by better capturing height-axis information and assigning dynamic attention across different height layers.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, showing training methodology impacts reliance on spurious signals and identifying problematic ImageNet classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks can exploit unintended patterns (spurious correlations) leading to correct but unreliable predictions, making detection crucial for trustworthy ML models.

Method: Proposed detection method for vision transformers using both supervised and self-supervised trained models on ImageNet dataset with large-scale experiments.

Result: Method successfully identifies spurious correlations; training methodology significantly affects model reliance on spurious signals; certain ImageNet classes contain easily detected spurious signals.

Conclusion: Provides exhaustive list of problematic images and calls for caution in their use; demonstrates real-world application in breast mass classification, highlighting importance of spurious correlation detection.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: Address real-world applications where only majority class labels are available for bags of instances, such as pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring.

Method: Proposed Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels by counting instances per class, and Majority Proportion Enhancement Module that removes minority class instances to increase majority proportion within bags.

Result: Superior performance on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods, with ablation studies confirming effectiveness of each module.

Conclusion: LML is a valuable problem with practical applications, and the proposed method effectively solves it by leveraging majority class information and enhancing learning through majority proportion optimization.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes a heterogeneous computing system using Phytium processors and Cambricon accelerators to achieve millisecond-level response for UAV tracking with 98.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional camera systems have >200ms response delays due to insufficient deep feature extraction and computing bottlenecks, failing to meet real-time requirements in complex surveillance scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides an innovative solution for UAV monitoring and domestic chip applications, successfully addressing real-time response challenges in video surveillance systems.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time

heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

TL;DR: An efficient re-ranking method using K-nearest Weighted Fusion to generate multi-view features from neighbors, improving person re-identification accuracy without requiring model fine-tuning or extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous re-identification methods rely on single-view images which suffer from view bias, pose variation, viewpoint changes, and occlusions. Multi-view features can help reduce these issues and improve accuracy.

Method: K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) method that aggregates neighbors' features in an unsupervised manner to generate multi-view features. Explores weight selection strategies during feature aggregation.

Result: Significant improvements in Rank@1 and mAP on Market1501, MSMT17, and Occluded-DukeMTMC datasets. Achieved 9.8%/22.0% Rank@1 improvements on MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC respectively. Also demonstrates substantial computational efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed re-ranking method effectively generates multi-view features to reduce view bias, significantly improves re-identification accuracy without additional training or annotations, and offers computational efficiency advantages over other re-ranking approaches.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BiT and CATS modules for audio-visual video parsing that combines semantic injection with temporal graph propagation to address noise amplification in weakly supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVVP methods either treat noisy pseudo-labels as reliable supervision or spread attention indiscriminately, amplifying initial errors during training.

Method: Combines Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module for semantic injection and feature purification with Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module for semantic propagation across time.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple key indicators across two benchmark datasets (LLP and UnAV-100).

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates strengths of previous research directions to improve audio-visual video parsing by addressing noise amplification issues in weakly supervised learning.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion is a novel framework for text-to-story visualization that maintains character consistency and accurate dialogue rendering through iterative processing, bounded attention masks, and identity-consistent self-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling in multi-character story visualization.

Method: Uses pre-trained LLM for per-frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues via in-context learning. Implements bounded attention-based per-box mask technique, identity-consistent self-attention for character consistency, region-aware cross-attention for object placement, and CLIPSeg for dialogue bubble assignment.

Result: Experimental results show TaleDiffusion outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses character consistency and dialogue accuracy challenges in text-to-story visualization, providing superior storytelling quality compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

TL;DR: MEPG is a multi-expert framework that uses LLMs to decompose prompts into spatial coordinates and style instructions, then routes generation through specialized experts for different regions and styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with complex multi-element prompts and limited stylistic diversity, needing better spatial understanding and style control.

Method: Uses Position-Style-Aware LLM to decompose prompts, then Multi-Expert Diffusion with attention-based gating to route generation through specialized experts for different regions and styles.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline models with same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.

Conclusion: MEPG provides an extensible framework for better handling complex prompts and diverse styles through expert routing and spatial decomposition.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

TL;DR: Better hyperparameter tuning of a simple vision backbone approach achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, matching commercial detectors and improving baseline by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform poorly on real-world benchmarks, with open-source models lagging behind commercial solutions (61-69% vs 82% accuracy).

Method: Revisits Ojha et al.'s approach using standard pretrained vision backbones with improved hyperparameter tuning for deepfake detection.

Result: Achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark, surpassing previous baseline by 18% and competing with commercial detectors.

Conclusion: Simple vision backbone approaches with proper tuning can achieve state-of-the-art performance, making deepfake detection more accessible and practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs enable wind power plant monitoring but require high-resolution data processing methods for reliable defect detection

Method: Developed ensemble approach integrating general-purpose YOLOv8 with specialized thermal model using bounding box fusion algorithm

Result: Achieved mAP@.5 of 0.93 and F1-score of 0.90, outperforming standalone YOLOv8 (mAP@.5 of 0.91)

Conclusion: Combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides more reliable detection of visual and thermal defects

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Conclusion: VisioFirm successfully addresses the scalability limitations of traditional annotation tools through AI-assisted automation, significantly reducing human effort while ensuring accurate annotations through its hybrid approach and interactive refinement capabilities.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCIR methods struggle with domain gaps because object features are entangled with domain-specific styles, making cross-domain retrieval challenging without annotations.

Method: Leverages text-to-image generative models to disentangle object features from domain styles, and aligns mutual neighbors progressively from within domains to across domains for reliable feature alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets spanning 13 different domains.

Conclusion: DUDE effectively addresses the domain gap problem in unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval through feature disentanglement and progressive alignment, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with effective reasoning over appropriate image regions in GUI grounding tasks, especially with high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions.

Method: Integrates Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region quality evaluation to jointly encourage accuracy and diversity in preference data construction, enabling adaptive reasoning steps based on task complexity.

Result: Achieves 55.7 score on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark with GTA1-7B model, establishing new state-of-the-art among 7B-scale models with consistent performance gains on ScreenSpot benchmarks.

Conclusion: LASER effectively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities for precise coordinate prediction, demonstrating superior performance in GUI grounding tasks through its self-evolving framework.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating multi-scale shape features (DMP) into semantic segmentation networks improves performance on overhead remote sensing imagery by addressing scale variation and shape information challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery faces challenges like extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes that standard networks developed for ground-perspective photos don't address well.

Method: Incorporated Differential Morphological Profile (DMP) features into three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using both direct input (adapting input stems) and hybrid dual-stream designs that fuse RGB and DMP encoders.

Result: Hybrid DMP architectures consistently outperformed direct-input variants and were capable of surpassing non-DMP models on mIoU, F1, and Recall metrics using the iSAID benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-scale shape features from DMP provide critical shape information that enhances semantic segmentation performance in overhead remote sensing imagery when properly integrated through hybrid fusion architectures.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

TL;DR: A text-guided 3D diffusion model that synthesizes tau PET images using structural MRI and plasma p-tau217 measurements as multimodal inputs, providing a cost-effective alternative to actual tau PET scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tau PET scans are crucial for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis but are expensive and limited in availability, while structural MRI and plasma biomarkers are more accessible but lack direct tau pathology visualization.

Method: A 3D diffusion model that uses textual prompts from plasma p-tau217 measurements and anatomical constraints from structural MRI to generate synthetic tau PET images, trained on ADNI clinical data.

Result: The approach successfully generates realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET images across various disease stages, demonstrating the feasibility of synthetic tau PET generation.

Conclusion: This framework enables tau PET data augmentation, provides a non-invasive cost-effective visualization alternative, and supports disease progression simulation under different biomarker conditions.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

*Junying Meng,Gangxuan Zhou,Jun Liu,Weihong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that integrates spatial regularization and volume priors through Wasserstein distance constraints at both image and dataset scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing semi-supervised medical image segmentation networks overlook effective methodological guidance for feature extraction and important prior information from datasets.

Method: Integrates explicit volume prior at image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization into backbone segmentation network. Uses regression network to estimate target region volumes and enforces constraints through image-scale and dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss functions.

Result: Experimental results on 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset show superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages both spatial regularization and volume priors to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

*Jianning Deng,Kartic Subr,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view images without camera poses, using only 4 views per articulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, enabling articulated object learning under weaker input assumptions.

Method: Reconstruct each articulation independently using sparse-view 3D reconstruction, learn deformation fields for cross-pose correspondences, use progressive disentanglement to separate static/moving parts, and jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with self-supervised consistency losses.

Result: Produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations from sparse inputs, outperforming existing approaches on standard benchmarks and real-world examples.

Conclusion: The method successfully learns articulated object representations with significantly weaker input requirements than previous approaches, demonstrating robust performance with minimal supervision.

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

*Yingxuan Li,Jiafeng Mao,Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using synthetic images as reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets, achieving significant accuracy improvements especially with semantic label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic noise in image classification datasets where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled poses challenges to supervised learning approaches.

Method: Proposes leveraging synthetic images generated by text-to-image models as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples, rather than using them directly for training.

Result: Significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions - 30% improvement on CIFAR-10, 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise.

Conclusion: The method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust techniques and achieves superior performance when combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The odd-one-out anomaly detection task presents challenges requiring spatial and relational reasoning across multiple views, object categories, and layouts, which need to be addressed efficiently.

Method: A DINO-based model architecture that significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining performance, with experimental evaluation including a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline for comparison.

Result: The proposed model achieves one-third parameter reduction and three times faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive performance on the odd-one-out task.

Conclusion: Efficient models can effectively address complex visual reasoning tasks like odd-one-out detection, and current MLLMs have limitations in structured visual reasoning that need further development.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,

*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena is an open platform that addresses data leakage and privacy issues in image geolocalization evaluation by using in-the-wild images and human pairwise judgments instead of exact coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image geolocalization evaluation suffers from data leakage (LVLMs pretrained on test data) and privacy concerns with exact coordinate metrics that neglect reasoning processes.

Method: Developed GeoArena platform that allows users to upload in-the-wild images and uses pairwise human judgments to evaluate which model outputs better align with human expectations.

Result: Deployed online for 2 months, collected thousands of voting records, established detailed analysis and leaderboard comparing different LVLMs on geolocalization tasks.

Conclusion: GeoArena provides a more accurate, privacy-conscious, and human-centered benchmarking approach for evaluating image geolocalization capabilities of large vision-language models.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

*JiYuan Wang,Chunyu Lin,Lei Sun,Rongying Liu,Lang Nie,Mingxing Li,Kang Liao,Xiangxiang Chu,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FE2E is a novel framework that adapts image editing models (rather than text-to-image generators) for dense geometry estimation, achieving superior performance through structural priors, consistent velocity training, and joint depth-normal estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models may be more suitable than text-to-image generative models as a foundation for fine-tuning in geometry estimation tasks.

Method: Adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, reformulates flow matching loss into consistent velocity training objective, uses logarithmic quantization for precision alignment, and leverages DiT's global attention for joint depth-normal estimation in a single forward pass.

Result: Achieves over 35% performance gains on ETH3D dataset, outperforms DepthAnything series trained on 100x more data, and shows impressive zero-shot performance improvements across multiple datasets without scaling training data.

Conclusion: Image editing models possess inherent structural priors that make them superior to generative models for dense geometry estimation, and the FE2E framework successfully leverages these advantages to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MICACL is a novel multi-instance learning framework for dynamic facial expression recognition that addresses long-tailed distributions and spatio-temporal complexity through graph-enhanced instance interaction, weighted aggregation, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFER methods struggle with long-tailed category distributions and complex spatio-temporal feature modeling, leading to severe model induction bias that limits performance.

Method: Proposes MICACL framework with: 1) Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM) using adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions, 2) Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN) for dynamic importance-based weighting, and 3) Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to balance major/minor category training.

Result: Extensive experiments on DFEW and FERV39k datasets show MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MICACL effectively addresses key challenges in DFER by integrating spatio-temporal dependency modeling with long-tailed contrastive learning optimization, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline that converts body-camera footage into panoramic images for quick situational awareness in emergency response scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First responders need quick visual summaries of incident scenes from body-camera footage, as reviewing lengthy videos is impractical in time-critical situations.

Method: Uses monocular SLAM to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct spatial layout, clusters camera poses to identify key viewpoints, selects representative frames, and fuses them into panoramic images using multi-frame stitching.

Result: Produces spatially coherent panoramic images that summarize complex environments, enabling rapid understanding and efficient decision-making.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively transforms body-camera footage into informative visual summaries that support quick incident analysis and situational awareness for first responders.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnomalyLMM is the first framework using Large Multi-modal Models for text-based person anomaly search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the PAB benchmark with +0.96% Recall@1 improvement through a training-free adaptation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples in public safety applications.

Method: A coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs with masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking for zero-shot anomaly detection without additional training.

Result: Achieves +0.96% improvement in Recall@1 accuracy on the PAB dataset, demonstrating effective interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors.

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM successfully bridges generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection, providing an effective training-free solution for text-based person anomaly search with interpretable results.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

TL;DR: ASE-MLLM is a novel framework that integrates aesthetic saliency features into multimodal large language models for improved aesthetic image captioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIC works using MLLMs don't specifically adapt models to focus on aesthetic content and primarily rely on fine-tuning without explicit aesthetic saliency integration.

Method: Proposes ASE-MLLM with Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) to extract aesthetic features and IAS-ViT encoder that fuses aesthetic saliency with original image features via cross-attention.

Result: Significantly outperforms traditional methods and generic MLLMs on mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM is the first framework to successfully integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks, demonstrating superior performance through explicit aesthetic feature extraction and fusion.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D style transfer pipeline that uses pretrained 2D diffusion models to generate stylized key views with cross-view attention and instance-level consistency, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods struggle with extracting high-level style semantics from reference images and often produce results lacking structural clarity and instance separation in 3D scenes.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints with cross-view style alignment (inserting cross-view attention in UNet), 2) Transfer stylized key views to 3D representation with instance-level style transfer.

Result: The method produces structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various scenes including forward-facing and 360-degree environments.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses limitations of existing 3D style transfer methods by leveraging diffusion model priors and ensuring both style fidelity and instance-level consistency, demonstrating superior performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtyINR is a self-supervised neural framework that simultaneously reconstructs objects and unknown probes in X-ray ptychography, achieving superior quality and robustness in low-signal conditions without requiring pre-characterized probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray ptychography's nanoscale resolution is limited by the challenge of accurate reconstruction when the illuminating probe is unknown, especially under low-signal conditions from low-dose/high-speed experiments, which compromises fidelity and restricts adoption.

Method: Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR) parameterizes both object and probe as continuous neural representations, performing end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without pre-characterization of the probe.

Result: Extensive evaluations show PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions.

Conclusion: PtyINR provides a generalizable, physics-informed framework for probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems beyond ptychography.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk-oriented dataset construction methods fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios, and lack unified evaluation metrics to prove effectiveness.

Method: Image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction starting with images and constructing paired text and guidance responses. Fine-tunes a safety judge model for standardized evaluation.

Result: Generated RMS dataset with 35k image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and scalability of the image-oriented approach across various tasks.

Conclusion: The image-oriented approach offers a new perspective for constructing real-world multimodal safety datasets, confirming its scalability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Method: Proposes MDT-dist framework with two optimizable objectives: Velocity Matching (VM) to match velocity fields between student and teacher models, and Velocity Distillation (VD) that enhances optimization using learned velocity fields for probability density distillation.

Result: Reduces sampling steps from 25 to 1-2 per flow transformer, achieving 0.68s (1 step) and 0.94s (2 steps) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800 while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: The method significantly outperforms existing Consistency Model distillation methods and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

*Hyunsoo Cha,Byungjun Kim,Hanbyul Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Durian is a zero-shot method for portrait animation with facial attribute transfer using dual reference networks in a diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art performance without explicit triplet supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent facial attribute transfer from reference images to target portraits in animation videos without requiring paired training data.

Method: Uses dual reference networks to inject spatial features from both portrait and attribute images into diffusion denoising. Trained with self-reconstruction from same video frames, mask expansion strategy, and spatial/appearance transformations for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer. The dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.

Conclusion: Durian successfully enables zero-shot portrait animation with facial attribute transfer through innovative dual reference networks and training strategies, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse attributes and real-world reference combinations.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

*Benjamin El-Zein,Dominik Eckert,Andreas Fieselmann,Christopher Syben,Ludwig Ritschl,Steffen Kappler,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based segmentation method using differentiable Hough transform to detect collimator shadows in X-ray images, achieving robust reconstruction with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts radiation exposure to ROI but collimator shadows can be obscured by scattered radiation, requiring accurate detection to minimize patient dose.

Method: Differentiable Hough transform-based network that detects collimation borders and extracts ROI center information, combining both tasks to generate line-constrained segmentation masks.

Result: Achieves median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real X-ray images, demonstrating robust reconstruction of collimated regions.

Conclusion: The method effectively detects polygonal collimation shadows and is not limited by a specific number of edges, providing accurate ROI identification for radiation dose minimization.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCF-UM introduces a cyclic evaluation framework to measure semantic drift in unified visual language models that handle both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, revealing significant variations in cross-modal consistency that standard single-pass metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for unified visual language models only assess image-to-text and text-to-image capabilities in isolation, failing to reveal whether models maintain semantic consistency when cycling between modalities or if they can both understand and render concepts consistently.

Method: The paper introduces UCF-UM, a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. It formulates three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), and Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG). They create ND400 benchmark from NoCaps and DOCCI datasets and evaluate seven recent models.

Result: UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability across models. Some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations, while others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. The framework successfully identifies semantic drift that standard evaluations miss.

Conclusion: Cyclic consistency is a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations. UCF-UM provides practical metrics to consistently assess unified models' cross-modal stability and the strength of their shared representations, addressing a critical gap in current evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception in applications like VR, autonomous driving, and robotics, with ODIs providing 360° field of view but presenting unique challenges compared to perspective images.

Method: Revisits panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods, analyzes structural disparities, summarizes three main domain adaptation challenges (geometric distortions, non-uniform sampling, boundary continuity), and categorizes panoramic vision into four major categories across 20+ tasks.

Result: Comprehensive survey covering 300+ research papers, providing cross-method analysis of strategies for panoramic challenges and cross-task comparison across visual quality enhancement, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications to advance panoramic vision research, offering new insights and forward-looking perspectives for developing panoramic vision technologies.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models lack flexibility for applying fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames in story visualization.

Method: A zero-shot framework that enables consistent story generation with fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail.

Result: The framework addresses the challenge of maintaining consistency while allowing both fine and coarse edits in multi-frame story visualization.

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish provides enhanced control and refinement capabilities for story visualization, enabling creators to seamlessly craft and refine visual stories with consistent narrative flow.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal misinformation poses increasing societal threats amplified by generative AI, and existing methods struggle with generalization across different distortion types.

Method: Developed TRUST-VL with Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module for task-specific visual features, trained on TRUST-Instruct dataset (198K samples) with structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: Joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances generalization capabilities for multimodal misinformation detection.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: VFR is a novel video generative model that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos through segment-by-segment generation, using prefix video conditions and anchor videos to ensure smoothness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generation of long virtual try-on videos without requiring resource-intensive generation processes or extensive video data, while maintaining flexibility for arbitrary video lengths.

Method: Auto-regressive segment-by-segment generation process with prefix video conditions for local smoothness between segments and anchor videos (360-degree wholebody capture) for global temporal consistency across segments.

Result: Successfully generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions.

Conclusion: VFR represents a pioneering approach in long virtual try-on video generation, effectively addressing the challenges of segment consistency and smooth transitions in extended video sequences.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

TL;DR: LuxDiT is a novel method that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to generate HDR environment maps from visual input, addressing lighting estimation challenges through synthetic data training and low-rank adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based lighting estimation is constrained by scarce and limited ground-truth HDR environment maps, while existing approaches struggle with indirect visual cues, global context inference, and HDR output recovery.

Method: Fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer on large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting, uses low-rank adaptation for semantic alignment, and learns from indirect visual cues to infer illumination.

Result: Produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency details, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: LuxDiT effectively generalizes to real-world scenes and demonstrates superior performance in HDR environment map generation from visual input compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: ContraGS enables training 3D Gaussian Splatting models directly on compressed representations using codebooks and Bayesian inference, reducing memory usage 3.49x while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires large numbers of Gaussians for high quality, which consumes significant GPU memory and slows training/rendering. Current codebook compression only works on fully trained models, not during training.

Method: Uses codebooks to compactly store Gaussian parameter vectors and poses parameter estimation as Bayesian inference problem, employing MCMC sampling over posterior distributions of compressed representations.

Result: Achieves 3.49x memory reduction during training, 1.36x training acceleration, and 1.88x rendering acceleration while maintaining close to state-of-art quality.

Conclusion: ContraGS successfully enables direct training on compressed 3DGS representations without reducing Gaussian counts, solving the challenge of learning non-differentiable parameters in codebook-compressed models through Bayesian inference.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Proposes TensoIS, a learning-based framework to estimate heterogeneous subsurface scattering parameters using Perlin noise modeling and low-rank tensor decomposition from multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating scattering parameters either use analysis-by-synthesis approaches or assume homogeneous media. There's a lack of well-defined distributions to model real-world heterogeneous scattering parameters, and procedural noise models like Perlin noise have shown effectiveness in representing natural surface heterogeneities.

Method: Created HeteroSynth synthetic dataset with photorealistic images of heterogeneous media using Fractal Perlin noise. Developed TensoIS - a feed-forward framework that uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent 3D scattering parameter volumes from sparse multi-view observations.

Result: TensoIS was evaluated on unseen heterogeneous variations from HeteroSynth test set, realistic volumetric simulations (smoke/cloud geometries), and real-world samples, demonstrating effectiveness for inverse scattering tasks.

Conclusion: This study explores Perlin noise distribution as a potential model for real-world heterogeneous scattering, addressing the lack of well-defined distributions in literature and enabling feed-forward estimation of complex scattering parameters.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

### [125] [SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04058)
*Lei Zhong,Yi Yang,Changjian Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SMooGPT uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate stylized human motion through body-part text reasoning, enabling interpretable and controllable motion generation that generalizes well to new styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stylized motion generation methods suffer from low interpretability, limited control, poor generalization to new styles, and are biased towards specific motions like walking. The authors observed that human motion can be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, and LLMs can understand and reason about human motion compositionally.

Method: Proposed SMooGPT - a fine-tuned LLM that acts as a reasoner, composer, and generator using body-part text space as intermediate representation. The approach follows a reasoning-composition-generation pipeline in text space for higher interpretability and control.

Result: The method achieves fine-grained motion control, effectively resolves conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to LLMs' open-vocabulary ability. Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: Using LLMs with body-part text representation provides a novel and effective approach for stylized motion generation, offering superior interpretability, control, and generalization compared to existing latent space methods.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Motivation: Existing approaches are either limited to person-specific models that don't generalize across identities, or generative methods that produce low-quality static avatars without realistic deformations like cloth wrinkles.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Optimize person-specific UNets for each avatar capturing pose-dependent deformations, 2) Train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights to generate new avatars.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods, achieving high photorealism with realistic pose-dependent deformations.

Conclusion: Successfully unites person-specific rendering quality with generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high quality and generalization across identities.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

### [127] [Crossing the Species Divide: Transfer Learning from Speech to Animal Sounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04166)
*Jules Cauzinille,Marius Miron,Olivier Pietquin,Masato Hagiwara,Ricard Marxer,Arnaud Rey,Benoit Favre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-supervised speech models like HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can effectively generate rich representations for animal sounds and achieve competitive performance on bioacoustic detection/classification tasks, showing potential as an efficient framework for bioacoustic research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised speech models have shown impressive performance in speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data like bioacoustic signals remains underexplored, creating a gap in understanding their transfer learning capabilities for animal sound analysis.

Method: Analyzed transfer learning capabilities using linear probing on time-averaged representations, extended with downstream architectures to account for time-wise information, and studied the effects of frequency range and noise on performance.

Result: The models generated rich latent representations of animal sounds across taxa, with results competitive against fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models, demonstrating the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups.

Conclusion: Speech-based self-supervised learning shows significant potential as an efficient framework for advancing bioacoustic research, with models effectively transferring to non-speech bioacoustic tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

*Xingtai Lv,Yuxin Zuo,Youbang Sun,Hongyi Liu,Yuntian Wei,Zhekai Chen,Lixuan He,Xuekai Zhu,Kaiyan Zhang,Bingning Wang,Ning Ding,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified theoretical framework showing that RL and SFT approaches are instances of a single optimization process, and proposes Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) that dynamically selects training signals for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between online (model-generated) and offline (human demonstrations) training data approaches, showing they are not contradictory but part of a unified optimization framework.

Method: Derived a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator with four interchangeable parts, and proposed HPT algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals for effective exploitation and stable exploration.

Result: HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, working well across models of varying scales and families.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified theoretical framework for post-training approaches and demonstrates the effectiveness of HPT in combining the strengths of different training signals for improved language model performance.

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

TL;DR: Delta Activations method represents finetuned LLMs as vector embeddings by measuring activation shifts from base models, enabling effective clustering by domain/task and showing robustness across finetuning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of open-source LLMs adapted to specific tasks creates challenges in navigating and understanding these models due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.

Method: Measure shifts in internal activations of finetuned models relative to a base model to create vector embeddings that capture model characteristics.

Result: Delta Activations enable effective clustering by domain and task, are robust across finetuning settings, exhibit additive properties, and can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning.

Conclusion: Delta Activations can facilitate model reuse by providing structured representations of finetuned models, with applications in model selection and merging.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

TL;DR: Empirical analysis of gradient variance evolution leads to hyperparameter-free normalization method that stabilizes optimization and maintains/improves test accuracy on CIFAR-100.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient dynamics are crucial for neural network stability and generalization, but there's a gap between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors that needs addressing.

Method: Proposed hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling with their natural evolution during training to prevent unintended amplification.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN show maintained or improved test accuracy even under strong generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: Direct tracking of gradient dynamics is important for bridging theory-practice gap, and the proposed method provides stable optimization while preserving convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

*Livia Betti,Farooq Sanni,Gnouyaro Sogoyou,Togbe Agbagla,Cullen Molitor,Tamma Carleton,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First framework for optimizing spatial training data collection in satellite ML, addressing data sparsity and cost constraints with novel methods that show significant performance gains across multiple continents and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite ML applications suffer from sparse, clustered labeled data collected for other purposes, leaving practitioners uncertain about how to collect additional data effectively within budget constraints.

Method: Novel problem formulation for spatial training data optimization with heterogeneous collection costs and budget constraints, plus methods to address this optimization challenge.

Result: Experiments across three continents and four tasks show substantial performance gains from optimized sampling strategies, with delineation of settings where optimization is most effective.

Conclusion: The framework and methods generalize across SatML domains and provide practical guidance for augmenting clustered surveys, with immediate application to agricultural monitoring in Togo.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

*Justin Kur,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel metric to automatically select optimal data augmentation strategies for quantization-aware knowledge distillation by maximizing contextual mutual information while maintaining prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT and KD methods focus on network output improvements but neglect the impact of input transformations like data augmentation, especially for low-precision models.

Method: Develops a metric that evaluates data augmentations based on their capacity to maximize contextual mutual information (non-label related information) while ensuring predictions align with ground truth labels.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the method significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD performance across various models and datasets with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed automated DA selection method effectively enhances quantization-aware knowledge distillation and is compatible with any QAT or KD algorithm.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQuad is a novel federated learning method that addresses data heterogeneity by optimizing intra-class variance and inter-class variance across clients to improve global model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with data heterogeneity among clients, especially with limited dataset sizes and class imbalance, which negatively impacts global model generalization during aggregation.

Method: FedQuad explicitly optimizes smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across clients by minimizing distance between similar pairs and maximizing distance between negative pairs, effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data distributions with many clients, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: Metric learning-based strategies like FedQuad are effective for addressing representational learning challenges in federated settings, particularly for handling data heterogeneity and improving model generalization.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

*Zidong Wang,Yiyuan Zhang,Xiaoyu Yue,Xiangyu Yue,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TiM introduces a novel generative paradigm with exact continuous-time dynamics that enables adaptive sampling from single-step to multi-step refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters than competitors while maintaining monotonic quality improvement with more steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off between computational cost and quality in generative modeling, where iterative diffusion models are computationally expensive while few-step alternatives have quality limitations due to restrictive training objectives.

Method: Developed an exact continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval, creating Transition Models (TiM) that adapt to arbitrary-step transitions from single leaps to fine-grained refinement.

Result: TiM with 865M parameters outperforms SD3.5 (8B) and FLUX.1 (12B) across all step counts, shows monotonic quality improvement with increased sampling budget, and achieves exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096 using native-resolution strategy.

Conclusion: TiM provides a breakthrough solution to the quality-computation trade-off in generative modeling, offering flexible sampling strategies with consistent quality improvements and superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A novel Contextualized Token Discrimination (CTD) method for speech query correction using BERT contextual representations and semantic enhancement to fix ASR transcription errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing popularity of speech search through ASR systems, there's a need for effective query spelling correction to help users express their intentions clearly despite ASR transcription errors.

Method: CTD uses BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations, constructs a composition layer to enhance semantic information, and corrects incorrect tokens by comparing original and contextualized representations to produce the correct query.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, and the paper presents a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions for comprehensive audio query correction evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed CTD method effectively addresses speech query correction challenges and provides a strong benchmark for future research in audio query correction.

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RAG systems are vulnerable to misinformation from retrieved evidence, especially adversarial content in health domain. Study shows adversarial documents degrade alignment but helpful evidence can preserve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems can reproduce misinformation from retrieved evidence, which is particularly dangerous in high-stakes domains like healthcare where incorrect responses can cause harm.

Method: Controlled experiments using health questions, varying document types (helpful, harmful, adversarial) and question framing (consistent, neutral, inconsistent), evaluating alignment between model outputs and ground-truth answers.

Result: Adversarial documents substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful evidence is also present in the retrieval pool.

Conclusion: Retrieval safeguards are needed for safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains, and helpful evidence can mitigate the impact of adversarial content.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github

*Or Shachar,Uri Katz,Yoav Goldberg,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: NER Retriever is a zero-shot framework that uses LLM internal representations and contrastive learning for schema-free named entity retrieval, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NER requires predefined entity types, but real-world applications need flexible retrieval based on user-defined type descriptions without fixed schemas or fine-tuned models.

Method: Uses mid-layer transformer block value vectors from LLMs to embed entities and type descriptions, then trains a lightweight contrastive projection network to align type-compatible entities in semantic space.

Result: Significantly outperforms lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines on three benchmarks, producing compact, type-aware embeddings suitable for nearest-neighbor search.

Conclusion: Provides empirical support for optimal representation selection within LLMs and offers a practical, scalable solution for schema-free entity retrieval.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A new local-to-global image retrieval paradigm that uses efficient local feature search followed by global feature re-ranking computed on-the-fly based on local similarity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional global-to-local retrieval misses partial matches and is limited by computational constraints. Emerging efficient local feature search enables detailed retrieval at scale, while global feature re-ranking shows promise for efficiency.

Method: Proposes local-to-global retrieval where efficient local feature search is followed by global feature re-ranking. Global features are computed on-the-fly using multidimensional scaling to create embeddings that respect local similarities from the search phase.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets, demonstrating solid retrieval performance with significant re-ranking boost.

Conclusion: The local-to-global paradigm with on-the-fly global feature computation based on local similarities enables effective and efficient image retrieval, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

*Kyra Wilson,Mattea Sim,Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Study shows people amplify AI racial bias in hiring decisions, favoring candidates aligned with AI preferences up to 90% of the time, but implicit association tests can reduce this effect by 13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how human-AI collaboration in resume screening amplifies racial bias and how implicit biases affect decision-making when working with AI systems that exhibit race-based preferences.

Method: Conducted a resume-screening experiment (N=528) using simulated AI models with race-based biases approximating real-world systems. Tested across 16 occupations using quality-controlled resumes with racial cues through names and affinity groups, measuring 1,526 scenarios with implicit association tests (IATs).

Result: People select candidates equally without biased AI, but favor AI-preferred candidates up to 90% when AI exhibits bias. IAT completion before screening increases selection of non-stereotyped candidates by 13%. Decisions remain vulnerable to AI bias even when users perceive recommendations as low quality.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration significantly amplifies racial bias in hiring. Organizations need policies that acknowledge the complexity of AI-human decision making, provide education, and implement oversight mechanisms to mitigate bias in collaborative systems.

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Embodied-LM is a neurosymbolic system that grounds LLM reasoning in image schemas using spatial reasoning and Answer Set Programming, improving logical deduction with better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack robust mental representations for logical reasoning and often make errors, unlike humans who use embodied cognitive structures derived from sensorimotor experience.

Method: The system uses schematic representations based on image schemas and operationalizes spatial foundations through declarative spatial reasoning in Answer Set Programming.

Result: LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied cognitive structures, which can be formalized as executable programs that support effective logical reasoning with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The prototype establishes a computational foundation for incorporating more complex dynamic representations, though currently focused on spatial primitives.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enhances LLM reasoning through emergent hierarchical planning, with HICRA algorithm focusing optimization on strategic tokens for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why RL improves LLM reasoning abilities and addressing inefficiencies in current RL algorithms that apply optimization pressure indiscriminately.

Method: Analysis of RL dynamics in LLMs, proposing HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA) to concentrate optimization on high-impact planning tokens, and using semantic entropy for strategic exploration measurement.

Result: HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines like GRPO, demonstrating that focusing on strategic bottlenecks is key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RL success in LLMs stems from emergent reasoning hierarchy, and targeted optimization on planning tokens (via HICRA) plus semantic entropy measurement provide more efficient and effective reasoning enhancement.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

### [143] [The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730)
*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show personality-like traits but self-reports don't reliably predict actual behavior, with persona injection affecting self-reports more than behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically characterize LLM personality across training stages, validate self-reported traits against behavior, and test intervention effects.

Method: Analyzed LLM personality across three dimensions: trait evolution during training, predictive validity of self-reports in behavioral tasks, and impact of persona injection interventions.

Result: Instructional alignment stabilizes trait expression and strengthens correlations similar to humans, but self-reported traits don't reliably predict behavior. Persona injection affects self-reports but has little consistent effect on actual behavior.

Conclusion: Surface-level trait expression differs from behavioral consistency, challenging assumptions about LLM personality and highlighting need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

*Zeyu Gan,Hao Yi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT-Space is a theoretical framework that reinterprets LLM reasoning as optimization in a continuous semantic space, explaining optimal CoT length convergence through underfitting-overfitting trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional token-level RL frameworks don't align with multi-step reasoning processes like Chain-of-Thought, creating a theoretical gap in understanding LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces CoT-Space framework that transforms LLM reasoning from discrete token prediction to continuous optimization in reasoning-level semantic space, analyzed from noise and risk perspectives.

Result: Demonstrates that convergence to optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of underfitting-overfitting trade-off, with extensive experiments providing empirical validation.

Conclusion: Provides coherent explanation for empirical phenomena like overthinking and offers solid theoretical foundation for developing more effective reasoning agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

TL;DR: MBTI-in-Thoughts framework uses MBTI personality conditioning via prompt engineering to control LLM agent behavior along cognitive and affective axes, enabling consistent personality-driven performance across tasks without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM agent effectiveness by grounding them in established psychological personality frameworks, enabling more human-like and predictable behavior patterns.

Method: Prompt engineering with MBTI personality archetypes, automated verification using official 16Personalities test, and testing across narrative generation and game-theoretic scenarios with self-reflection protocols.

Result: Personality priming yields consistent behavioral biases - emotionally expressive agents excel in narrative tasks, analytical agents show stable strategies in game settings. Self-reflection improves cooperation and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges psychological theory with LLM behavior design, generalizes to other personality frameworks, and establishes foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents without fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

*Matthew Ho,Chen Si,Zhaoxiang Feng,Fangxu Yu,Zhijian Liu,Zhiting Hu,Lianhui Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes concept-level memory for LLMs that distills reusable abstractions from reasoning traces instead of storing exact query/response pairs, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time scaling produces valuable reasoning traces that are discarded after context reset. External memory can persist these discoveries, but existing instance-based approaches lack reusability and scalability.

Method: Introduces strategies for abstracting takeaways from solution rollouts into modular natural language concepts, and selectively retrieving relevant concepts for new queries to enable test-time continual learning.

Result: On ARC-AGI benchmark, achieves 7.5% relative gain over strong no-memory baseline with performance scaling with inference compute. Abstract concepts outperform all tested memory designs and fixed memory settings.

Conclusion: Concept-level memory enables effective test-time continual learning through reusable abstractions, supporting self-improvement as solving more problems leads to better pattern abstraction and further solutions.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-powered framework analyzes tourist perception in historic urban quarters using social media data, combining visual analysis of photos and sentiment analysis of reviews to understand aesthetic preferences and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding tourist perception is essential for sustainable, human-centered urban planning in historic urban quarters that preserve cultural heritage while serving tourism and daily life.

Method: Multimodal framework integrating focal point extraction from photos using semantic segmentation, color theme analysis via clustering, and hybrid sentiment analysis combining rule-based methods with multi-task BERT model on tourist reviews across four dimensions.

Result: Reveals spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response, identifies divergence between social media photos and real-world street views, highlighting gaps between visual expectations and built environment.

Conclusion: Provides an integrated, data-driven approach for decoding tourist perception to support informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and public space design.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

*Gaspard Michel,Elena V. Epure,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: LibriQuote dataset provides 18K hours of English speech (12.7K neutral + 5.3K expressive) from audiobooks with context and pseudo-labels for expressive TTS training and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large TTS datasets lack clear expressive speech proportions, and current expressive corpora are too small for effective training and benchmarking of zero-shot TTS systems.

Method: Created LibriQuote dataset from audiobooks with expressive speech subset containing character quotations, context information, and pseudo-labels (speech verbs/adverbs). Includes 7.5-hour test set for evaluating expressive synthesis while preserving reference timbre.

Result: Fine-tuning TTS on LibriQuote significantly improves speech intelligibility. Current systems fail to match ground-truth expressiveness and naturalness. The dataset covers wide emotional range and various accents.

Conclusion: LibriQuote enables better expressive TTS training and benchmarking, showing current limitations in expressive synthesis and providing a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

Motivation: To provide grasping assistance for individuals with motor impairments in unstructured environments where object categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable.

Method: Integrates vision-language foundation model with open-vocabulary mechanism for zero-shot object detection, multimodal decision-maker for intent inference, and deploys on custom egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton.

Result: Achieves grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00% with 10 participants on 15 objects across 3 grasp types, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with improved kinematic alignment.

Conclusion: OVGrasp demonstrates effective multimodal interaction for grasp assistance, enabling robust performance in open environments without retraining requirements.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

TL;DR: DEXOP is a passive hand exoskeleton that enables natural human manipulation data collection for robots through direct force feedback and pose mirroring, outperforming teleoperation in data quality and transfer efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional teleoperation for robotic data collection lacks natural human manipulation feel and limits transferability to real robots. There's a need for a more intuitive, efficient way to collect rich sensory data for dexterous manipulation tasks.

Method: Developed DEXOP - a passive hand exoskeleton that mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing direct contact feedback via proprioception and mirroring human hand poses to the robot hand for natural task demonstrations.

Result: DEXOP enables high-quality demonstration data collection at scale across diverse dexterous tasks. Policies learned from DEXOP data significantly improve task performance per unit time compared to teleoperation.

Conclusion: DEXOP represents an effective paradigm (perioperation) for robotic data collection that maximizes human ability and data transferability, making it a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity through natural human demonstrations.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.
