### [1] [Collaborative and Proactive Management of Task-Oriented Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05110)
*Arezoo Saedi,Afsaneh Fatemi,Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsh,Sophie Rosset,Anne Vilnat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A task-oriented dialogue system model that incorporates goal-aware planning using information states and intermediate information, implemented with LLMs via in-context learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TOD systems centered on LLMs often overlook effective goal-aware planning, which is crucial for task completion. The paper aims to address this gap by creating a model that incorporates constructive intermediate information in planning.

Method: Created a dialogue management model based on information state approach: predefined slots and text components model user preferences; identified critical circumstances and created corresponding informational components; defined limited information states from component configurations; created dialogue moves between states; implemented using LLM in-context learning with database queries based on slots and entity ordering based on text parts.

Result: Evaluations on MultiWOZ single-domain conversations showed maximal inform and success rates, with improvements compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully incorporates goal-aware planning through information states and intermediate information, demonstrating superior performance in task-oriented dialogue systems when implemented with LLMs.

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

### [2] [Trainable Reference-Based Evaluation Metric for Identifying Quality of English-Gujarati Machine Translation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05113)
*Nisheeth Joshi,Pragya Katyayan,Palak Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new reference-based machine translation evaluation metric for Gujarati using supervised learning with neural networks, showing better human correlation than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT evaluation metrics that work well for English and European languages don't perform well with Indian languages like Gujarati, necessitating language-specific evaluation methods.

Method: Developed two neural network models using supervised learning with 25 features - one with 6 hidden layers and another with 10 hidden layers, both trained for 500 epochs. Tested on 1000 MT outputs from 7 systems compared against human reference translations.

Result: The developed metrics showed better human correlation compared to other available metrics when evaluated on Gujarati machine translation outputs.

Conclusion: The supervised learning-based approach successfully created an effective MT evaluation metric specifically for Gujarati that outperforms existing general-purpose metrics.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

### [3] [Hallucination is Inevitable for LLMs with the Open World Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05116)
*Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reframes LLM hallucinations as a manifestation of the generalization problem, arguing they are inevitable under open-world conditions and should be treated as a structural feature rather than just an engineering defect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more complete understanding of LLM hallucinations by considering AGI requirements, moving beyond viewing them merely as defects to be minimized or theoretically inevitable phenomena.

Method: Develops a classification of hallucinations distinguishing correctable cases from unavoidable ones under open-world conditions, analyzing the problem through closed vs. open world assumptions.

Result: Shows that while hallucinations may be mitigated under closed-world assumptions, they become inevitable under open-world conditions where the environment is unbounded.

Conclusion: Hallucinations should be approached not merely as engineering defects but as structural features to be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

### [4] [Towards Structured Knowledge: Advancing Triple Extraction from Regional Trade Agreements using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05121)
*Durgesh Nandini,Rebekka Koch,Mirco Schoenfeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates LLMs for extracting Subject-Predicate-Object triples from economic texts, specifically using Llama 3.1 on regional trade agreements with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for structured knowledge extraction in economics, particularly for creating economic trade knowledge graphs from legal trade agreement texts.

Method: Applied Llama 3.1 model to process unstructured regional trade agreement texts using zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques with positive and negative examples.

Result: The study evaluated performance using quantitative and qualitative metrics, discussing insights, challenges, and the significance of language models in economic applications.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for extracting structured knowledge from economic texts, with potential applications in creating economic trade knowledge graphs, though challenges remain that require future research directions.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object
triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The
findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of
economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement
texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to
extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the
zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive
and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and
qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the
unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key
insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the
significance of language models in economic applications.

### [5] [CARE: Cognitive-reasoning Augmented Reinforcement for Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05122)
*Jie Zhu,Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE is a novel framework that enhances reasoning in Emotional Support Conversation by leveraging original training data and reinforcement learning, improving logical coherence and supportive quality without synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ESC research focuses on data augmentation but overlooks deeper cognitive reasoning processes needed for effective emotional support.

Method: Uses original ESC training set to guide response generation for logical coherence, then applies reinforcement learning to refine the reasoning process.

Result: Significantly improves both logical soundness and supportive quality of responses in emotional support conversations.

Conclusion: Advances development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support systems through enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

### [6] [MADS: Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation for Diverse Persuasion Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05124)
*Mingjin Li,Yu Liu,Huayi Liu,Xiang Ye,Chao Jiang,Hongguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MADS is a multi-agent framework that generates persuasive dialogues through agent self-play, enabling low-cost training data generation without human annotation and improving conversion rates in real-world marketing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address industry challenges like lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and prompt inefficiency by creating a scalable framework for generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues without human annotation.

Method: Uses three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies, and an Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. Validated through Chain-of-Attitude modeling and LLM persuasion assessment.

Result: Applied to real-world marketing, MADS significantly improved persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4% (from 1.83% to 2.24%).

Conclusion: MADS demonstrates clear business value by enabling low-cost generation of training data and improving conversion rates through enhanced persuasion capabilities in multi-agent dialogue systems.

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

### [7] [Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05125)
*Reza Shirkavand,Xiaokai Wei,Chen Wang,Zheng Hui,Heng Huang,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDIOMoE unifies collaborative filtering and LLMs by treating item interactions as a native language dialect, using mixture-of-experts architecture with separate text and item experts to avoid modality interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recommendation systems need to combine collaborative filtering's accuracy with LLMs' expressiveness for natural-language queries and transparent explanations, but current approaches struggle with semantic opacity vs implicit preference modeling.

Method: Introduces Item-ID + Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts (IDIOMoE) that splits Feed Forward Network into separate text and item experts with token-type gating, treating item interactions as native dialect in language space.

Result: Demonstrates strong recommendation performance on both public and proprietary datasets while preserving the original LLM's text understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: IDIOMoE successfully bridges collaborative filtering and LLMs by enabling collaborative signals to be understood as natural language, achieving both recommendation accuracy and language model preservation.

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

### [8] [Improving Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05126)
*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetuning LLMs improves their ability to communicate uncertainty through better calibration and discrimination, but improvements are task-specific and require multitask training for broader generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in decision-making but often present answers without signaling low confidence, leading users to unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While LLMs maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is typically miscalibrated.

Method: Supervised finetuning of LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia. Evaluated two metacognitive tasks: single-question confidence estimation and pairwise confidence comparison. Assessed generalization to unseen domains including medical and legal reasoning.

Result: Finetuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific and don't transfer between single-question calibration and pairwise comparison.

Conclusion: Uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable, but different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must be developed together through multitask training for broader gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

### [9] [Advancing Automated Spatio-Semantic Analysis in Picture Description Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05128)
*Si-Ioi Ng,Pranav S. Ambadi,Kimberly D. Mueller,Julie Liss,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A BERT-based pipeline for automated extraction and ordering of content information units (CIUs) from picture descriptions, achieving high precision/recall in CIU detection and strong correlation with manual annotations for cognitive impairment assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for automated cognitive-linguistic impairment assessment neglect visual narrative paths and require labor-intensive manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping of content information units.

Method: Proposes a BERT-based pipeline fine-tuned with binary cross-entropy and pairwise ranking loss for automated CIU extraction and ordering from Cookie Theft picture descriptions, evaluated via 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, 24% sequence error rates. Features show strong Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpass dictionary-based baseline, and perform comparably to manual annotations in group difference evaluation.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively characterizes visual narrative paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with implementation and models open-sourced to the public.

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

### [10] [Automated Alignment of Math Items to Content Standards in Large-Scale Assessments Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05129)
*Qingshu Xu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Ming Li,Nan Zhang,Sydney Peters,Yanbin Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates three automated methods for aligning assessment items with content standards: classical ML models with embeddings, fine-tuned BERT variants, and ensemble learning. DeBERTa-v3-base achieved best domain alignment (F1=0.950), RoBERTa-large best skill alignment (F1=0.869), with ensembles not outperforming top language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score interpretation in large-scale assessments, requiring automated methods to handle domain and skill labeling efficiently.

Method: Three approaches: 1) Classical ML models with embeddings and dimensionality reduction, 2) Fine-tuning eight BERT variants for domain and skill alignment, 3) Ensemble learning with majority voting and stacking with meta-models.

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base achieved highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for domain alignment; RoBERTa-large yielded highest F1 score of 0.869 for skill alignment. Ensemble models didn't surpass best language models. Dimension reduction helped linear classifiers but not language models.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrated different automated methods for item alignment to content standards, with fine-tuned language models outperforming classical ML approaches and ensembles, providing effective solutions for large-scale assessment alignment.

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

### [11] [Submodular Context Partitioning and Compression for In-Context Learning-short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05130)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Canyu Zhang,Tianyi Zhou,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sub-CP is a block-aware context selection framework that uses submodular objectives to control block diversity in in-context learning, addressing information redundancy and under-representation issues in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficient ICL approaches that partition context into blocks often suffer from information redundancy or under-representation due to different partition strategies, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Propose Sub-CP framework that leverages submodular objectives to control block diversity, supporting flexible selection strategies from globally diverse to locally coherent blocks while enabling precomputation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance across different model scales.

Conclusion: Sub-CP provides an effective solution for optimizing context selection in in-context learning by controlling block diversity through submodular objectives.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

### [12] [Rationale-Augmented Retrieval with Constrained LLM Re-Ranking for Task Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05131)
*Bowen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid semantic search system combining lexical retrieval, vector similarity, and LLM re-ranking to help Head Start staff find tasks on GoEngage platform, addressing jargon and search limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start staff struggle to locate tasks due to domain-specific jargon, system-specific terms, and limitations of lexical search (typos, word ordering issues).

Method: Hybrid semantic search system with: 1) typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, 2) embedding-based vector similarity, 3) constrained LLM re-ranking. Uses existing infrastructure with caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation.

Result: Comprehensive framework provided with resources, phased implementation strategy, offline evaluation protocol (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and online measurement methodology.

Conclusion: The proposed system ensures trustworthiness (low false positives), evolvability (handles terminology changes), and economic efficiency while addressing search challenges in GoEngage platform.

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

### [13] [Training Large Language Models To Reason In Parallel With Global Forking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05132)
*Sheng Jia,Xiao Wang,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSFT (Set Supervised Fine-Tuning) improves LLM reasoning by treating parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem with a global loss, preserving diverse reasoning modes better than standard SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods like temperature scaling struggle to balance diversity and accuracy in reasoning paths, as critical forking tokens that trigger correct diverse reasoning are deep in sampling trees.

Method: Propose SSFT that incorporates set-based global loss into SFT using self-supervised bipartite matching between global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces to preserve reasoning diversity.

Result: SSFT consistently outperforms SFT on multiple reasoning benchmarks under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics, preserving emergent global forking tokens and reasoning modes.

Conclusion: Treating parallel reasoning as a set prediction problem with global loss effectively preserves diverse reasoning paths and improves LLM performance on challenging problems.

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

### [14] [Characterizing Model Behavior Under Synthetic Data Training: An Empirical Study Across Scales and Mixing Ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05133)
*Y. Du,G. Wu,G. Tang,W. Wang,Q. Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how synthetic data proportions affect model performance across different scales, finding that up to 20% synthetic data maintains stable performance, with degradation accelerating beyond 30%, and larger models showing greater robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across different scales, as current understanding is limited despite synthetic data's integral role in modern NLP training pipelines.

Method: Controlled empirical study using Pythia model suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, evaluating models after 1-3 training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from 0-50%.

Result: Models maintain stable performance with up to 20% synthetic data; degradation accelerates beyond 30%; larger models (6.9B-12B) show greater robustness than smaller models (410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss; reasoning tasks degrade faster than retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Current best practices (STaR, Self-Instruct) operate within safe regimes; practical guidance provided for synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task requirements; comparison with concurrent work on model collapse.

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Motivation: Current LLMs excel at objective tasks but struggle with subjective creativity assessment, particularly when dealing with individual differences in creative judgment.

Method: Proposes a curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge approach personalized to individual creative judgments, tested on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking benchmark with expert human annotations.

Result: Shows improvements over baseline supervised finetuning across various evaluation metrics (Pearson correlation, Cohen's, F1 values), especially effective when annotators disagree.

Conclusion: The method enables models to learn nuanced creative judgments of different individuals and is particularly useful for subjective evaluations with annotator disagreement.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

### [16] [Linguistic Characteristics of AI-Generated Text: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05136)
*Luka Terčon,Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper synthesizing research on linguistic features of AI-generated text, finding it tends to be more formal, impersonal, with lower lexical diversity and vocabulary size, while highlighting research gaps in cross-linguistic studies and prompt sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to study linguistic features in AI-generated text due to its increasing presence in fields like education, healthcare, and scientific research, requiring broader synthesis of existing findings.

Method: Survey and categorization of existing research along dimensions including linguistic description levels, models included, genres analyzed, languages analyzed, and prompting approaches.

Result: AI-generated text shows more formal/impersonal style with increased nouns, determiners, adpositions and reduced adjectives/adverbs; lower lexical diversity; smaller vocabulary; and repetitive text. Research is concentrated on English and GPT models.

Conclusion: Current research lacks cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation, and fails to address prompt sensitivity adequately, leaving significant room for future studies with multiple prompt variations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

*Maojia Song,Renhang Liu,Xinyu Wang,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Soujanya Poria,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebDetective is a new benchmark that addresses limitations in current RAG and web agent evaluation by providing hint-free multi-hop questions with full traceability and a holistic evaluation framework that separates search, knowledge use, and refusal behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks leak reasoning paths in questions, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover reasoning chains autonomously. Evaluation is reduced to single pass rates that obscure whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or inappropriate refusal.

Method: Created WebDetective benchmark with hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox for full traceability. Developed holistic evaluation framework separating search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation, and refusal behaviour. Evaluated 25 state-of-the-art models and developed EvidenceLoop agentic workflow with verification loops and systematic evidence tracking.

Result: Models show systematic weaknesses: struggle with knowledge utilisation despite sufficient evidence, and demonstrate near-absent appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. Models excel at executing given reasoning paths but fail when required to discover them.

Conclusion: WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural improvements and is a critical tool for developing genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

*Gregory Hok Tjoan Go,Khang Ly,Anders Søgaard,Amin Tabatabaei,Maarten de Rijke,Xinyi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA is a multi-agent workflow that automates literature review writing by simulating human review processes, outperforming existing methods in writing quality and citation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of scientific publications makes comprehensive literature reviews challenging, with existing automation focusing mainly on retrieval and screening while leaving writing quality and factual accuracy under-explored.

Method: LiRA uses a multi-agent collaborative workflow with specialized agents for content outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing to emulate human literature review processes.

Result: LiRA outperforms baselines like AutoSurvey and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality on SciReviewGen and ScienceDirect datasets, while maintaining competitive similarity to human-written reviews. It also shows robustness to reviewer model variation.

Conclusion: Agentic LLM workflows like LiRA can improve the reliability and usability of automated scientific writing even without domain-specific tuning, demonstrating significant potential for literature review automation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

*Hamed Jelodar,Mohammad Meymani,Parisa Hamedi,Tochukwu Emmanuel Nwankwo,Samita Bai,Roozbeh Razavi-Far,Ali A. Ghorbani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLD-LLM is a framework for evaluating language models' ability to generate accurate code descriptions from natural language inputs using various transformer models and prompt engineering strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate language models' performance in generating structured and meaningful natural language descriptions from code inputs, addressing the need for comprehensive assessment in NLP tasks.

Method: Proposed NLD-LLM framework incorporating diverse transformer models (Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, Mistral) with comprehensive prompt design strategy including standardized formatting, clear task guidance, and iterative refinement process.

Result: Analysis using semantic and structural metrics shows that prompt engineering significantly impacts model effectiveness, with smaller models performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

Conclusion: Well-designed prompts can enable smaller language models to achieve competitive performance in natural language description tasks, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering in model evaluation and deployment.

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

### [20] [To model human linguistic prediction, make LLMs less superhuman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05141)
*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are superhuman at predicting words compared to humans, making them poor cognitive models of human reading behavior. This is due to their superior long-term and short-term memory capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models, despite being excellent at next-word prediction, fail to accurately model human reading behavior and processing difficulty.

Method: Analyzing the factors that make LLMs superhuman compared to humans, focusing on their superior long-term memory for facts/training data and short-term memory for text context.

Result: LLMs predict much lower processing difficulty than observed in human experiments because they can predict upcoming words much better than humans can.

Conclusion: We need to develop models with human-like memory capabilities and collect better human data to properly evaluate progress toward creating accurate cognitive models of language comprehension.

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

*Xin Wang,Anshu Raj,Matthew Luebbe,Haiming Wen,Shuozhi Xu,Kun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-stage LLM-powered pipeline extracts 47 materials science features from literature with high accuracy (F1~0.96), reducing missed materials from 12.4% to 3.3% and enabling comprehensive databases for machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most materials science information remains trapped in unstructured literature, with existing extraction methods focusing on limited features and failing to capture integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property relationships essential for understanding materials behavior.

Method: Multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language models that captures 47 features spanning composition, processing, microstructure, and properties from experimental reports, integrating iterative extraction with source tracking for enhanced accuracy and reliability.

Result: Achieved F1 scores around 0.96 at both feature and tuple levels. Improved microstructure category F1 scores by 10.0% (feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level) compared to single-pass extraction. Reduced missed materials from 49 to 13 out of 396 materials (miss rate from 12.4% to 3.3%) in precipitate-containing multi-principal element alloys.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives, providing trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials informatics while generalizing to diverse material classes.

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynCED-EnDe is a new balanced dataset for Critical Error Detection in machine translation, featuring 9,000 English-German sentence pairs with enriched annotations including error subclasses and fine-grained judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of the WMT21 CED dataset in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal freshness, enabling better analysis of error risk and intricacy beyond binary detection.

Method: Created a new resource with 1,000 gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs from diverse 2024-2025 sources (StackExchange, GOV.UK), balanced 50/50 between error and non-error cases with explicit error subclasses and structured trigger flags.

Result: Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations.

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe serves as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in emerging contexts like wearable AI devices.

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

### [23] [Every Step Counts: Decoding Trajectories as Authorship Fingerprints of dLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05148)
*Qi Li,Runpeng Yu,Haiquan Lu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel model attribution method for discrete diffusion LLMs using decoding trajectories, introducing Directed Decoding Map (DDM) to extract structural information and Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA) for likelihood-based attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the unique decoding mechanism of discrete diffusion LLMs for model attribution across diverse scenarios, including distinguishing different models and different checkpoints of the same model.

Method: Proposes Directed Decoding Map (DDM) to capture structural relationships between decoding steps, overcoming redundancy in model confidence, and Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA) that fits cell-wise Gaussian distributions for likelihood-based attribution.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the utility of the proposed methods under different settings, showing improved performance over direct model confidence approaches.

Conclusion: The decoding mechanism of dLLMs can be effectively used for model attribution through structural information extraction and likelihood-based scoring, providing a powerful tool for model identification.

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

*Donghang Wu,Haoyang Zhang,Chen Chen,Tianyu Zhang,Fei Tian,Xuerui Yang,Gang Yu,Hexin Liu,Nana Hou,Yuchen Hu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chronological Thinking is a real-time conversational thinking mechanism for full-duplex spoken dialogue systems that enables lightweight reasoning during listening phases without adding latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing full-duplex systems keep agents idle during listening by predicting silence tokens, unlike humans who engage in continuous thinking during conversations.

Method: A strictly causal thinking approach that reasons incrementally while listening, updating hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead, amortizing reasoning during listening windows.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in response quality through both objective metrics and human evaluations, with robust handling of conversational dynamics.

Conclusion: Chronological thinking effectively improves response quality in full-duplex spoken dialogue systems while maintaining real-time performance and handling conversational dynamics.

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Method: Evaluated FinMA model from PIXIU framework using its architecture, instruction tuning with Financial Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and assessment under FLARE benchmark.

Result: FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and classification tasks, but struggles significantly with numerical reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization.

Conclusion: This research advances understanding of how financial LLMs should be designed and evaluated to effectively support finance-related decision-making processes.

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large

adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial

*Jingtong Su,Jianyu Zhang,Karen Ullrich,Léon Bottou,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The choice of delimiter (comma, new line, etc.) between in-context examples significantly impacts LLM performance, causing up to ±23% variation in MMLU scores and allowing manipulation of model rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While the number of in-context examples has been standardized, the formatting choice of how to separate examples is understudied despite being a common user decision in evaluation protocols and real-world usage.

Method: Tested different delimiters across leading LLM families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma) on MMLU, analyzed attention head scores to understand mechanism, and explored methods to improve robustness including specifying delimiters in prompts.

Result: Performance varied dramatically (±23%) based on delimiter choice, allowing manipulation of model rankings. Good delimiters steer attention toward key tokens. Specifying delimiters in prompts improves robustness.

Conclusion: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to delimiter choice across topics and model families, with no improvement at scale. Practical recommendations include specifying delimiters in prompts and using best-performing separators.

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

TL;DR: DeliberationBank is a human-grounded dataset for evaluating deliberation summaries, with DeliberationJudge as a fine-tuned model that outperforms LLM judges in aligning with human judgments on representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, and policy approval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs risk underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias in deliberation summaries, but current evaluation methods using LLMs as judges show weak alignment with human judgments, requiring a more reliable evaluation framework.

Method: Created DeliberationBank dataset with opinion data from 3,000 participants and summary judgment data from 4,500 participants across four dimensions. Trained DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model, to rate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives.

Result: DeliberationJudge is more efficient and better aligned with human judgments than various LLM judges. Evaluation of 18 LLMs revealed persistent weaknesses in deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority positions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative and equitable for policymaking.

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM reliability by developing a lightweight framework that can automatically detect hallucinations during model inference without requiring extensive computational resources.

Method: Systematic taxonomy of hallucination types, controlled reproduction through prompt engineering, mapping hallucinations to vector space using embeddings, and unsupervised learning analysis in reduced-dimensional representation.

Result: Quantitative evaluation shows consistent correlation between hallucination severity and spatial divergence from correct outputs, demonstrating that simple classifiers can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate responses.

Conclusion: The approach provides theoretical and empirical evidence for effective hallucination detection within a single LLM, offering a lightweight framework to improve model reliability.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

TL;DR: EAD is a temperature annealing method that starts with high temperature for exploration at the beginning of generation and gradually lowers temperature for exploitation at the end, improving sample efficiency in RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fixed-temperature sampling struggles to balance exploration (discovering diverse solutions) and exploitation (maintaining sample quality and training stability) in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Method: Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD) implements a dynamic temperature schedule that anneals from high to low during sequence generation, encouraging exploration on early tokens and exploitation on later tokens.

Result: EAD consistently outperforms fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes, significantly improving sample efficiency while maintaining training stability.

Conclusion: Aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential generation (explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end) offers a robust approach to improving LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: Camellia benchmark evaluates cultural biases in LLMs across 9 Asian languages, revealing struggles with cultural adaptation, distinct cultural-sentiment biases, and performance gaps in entity extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multilingual benchmarks for measuring cultural biases in LLMs, particularly concerns about Western-centric entity preferences in non-Western languages.

Method: Developed Camellia benchmark with 19,530 culturally-annotated entities and 2,173 masked contexts from social media, evaluated across 4 multilingual LLM families on cultural adaptation, sentiment association, and entity QA tasks.

Result: LLMs struggle with cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, show distinct cultural-sentiment biases across model families, and exhibit performance gaps between cultures in entity extraction due to context understanding issues.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate significant cultural biases and adaptation challenges in Asian languages, highlighting the need for better cultural awareness and more diverse training data in multilingual models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based guardrail models are vulnerable to data distribution shifts, particularly when benign documents are inserted into the context, altering safety judgments in 11% of input and 8% of output cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing adoption of LLMs, ensuring safety has become critical. External guardrail models are popular but vulnerable to data distribution shifts, especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss models, testing robustness against additional information in context by inserting benign documents and analyzing effects of retrieved documents, user query, and LLM-generated response.

Result: Inserting benign documents alters guardrail judgments in 11% of input cases and 8% of output cases. Mitigation methods tested provided only minor improvements.

Conclusion: Current guardrails have a context-robustness gap, motivating the need for training and evaluation protocols robust to retrieval and query composition.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeatherArchive-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating RAG systems on historical weather archives, featuring retrieval and assessment tasks to measure system performance on locating relevant passages and classifying societal vulnerability/resilience indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical weather archives contain valuable qualitative insights about societal responses to extreme weather that are missing from meteorological records, but their scale, digitization quality, and archaic language make them difficult to use for climate research.

Method: Created WeatherArchive-Bench with two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval (locating relevant passages from over 1M archival news segments) and WeatherArchive-Assessment (evaluating LLMs' ability to classify vulnerability and resilience indicators). Tested sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers plus various LLMs.

Result: Dense retrievers often fail on historical terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience concepts. These findings reveal limitations in reasoning about complex societal indicators.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights key challenges in processing historical weather archives and provides insights for designing more robust climate-focused RAG systems. The dataset and framework are publicly available.

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Residualized Similarity (RS) is a novel method that supplements interpretable authorship verification systems with neural networks to improve performance while maintaining interpretability by predicting similarity residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural methods for authorship verification achieve high accuracy but lack interpretability, and LLM predictions cannot be faithfully explained, which is problematic for real-world decision-making applications.

Method: The RS method uses neural networks to predict the residual error in similarity predictions made by interpretable systems, maintaining interpretability while improving performance.

Result: Evaluation across four datasets shows RS can match state-of-the-art authorship verification model performance while providing faithful and interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: The Residualized Similarity approach successfully bridges the gap between high accuracy and interpretability in authorship verification systems, enabling trustworthy deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey of recent approaches to overcome quadratic complexity bottleneck in Transformers, including sub-quadratic attention variants, RNNs, state space models, and hybrid architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' quadratic attention complexity becomes a significant bottleneck as context length increases, limiting their scalability for long sequences.

Method: Critical analysis of various approaches including sub-quadratic attention mechanisms, recurrent neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures.

Result: Comprehensive survey comparing these methods in terms of compute/memory complexity, benchmark performance, and fundamental limitations.

Conclusion: The dominance of pure-attention Transformers may soon be challenged by more efficient alternatives that address the quadratic complexity bottleneck.

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs suffer performance degradation on long-context tasks even with perfect retrieval, due to input length itself rather than retrieval failures. A simple mitigation strategy improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why LLMs fail to scale performance with context length despite perfect retrieval, challenging the common assumption that retrieval failures are the primary cause.

Method: Systematic experiments across 5 LLMs on math, QA, and coding tasks, testing performance with perfect retrieval, minimal distractions, masked irrelevant tokens, and immediate evidence placement.

Result: Performance degrades 13.9%-85% with longer inputs even with perfect retrieval, minimal distractions, and forced attention to relevant tokens. A simple recitation strategy improves GPT-4o performance by up to 4%.

Conclusion: Input length itself hurts LLM performance independent of retrieval quality, revealing a previously unrealized limitation that requires new mitigation strategies beyond improving retrieval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented and underrepresented in clinical NLP, with current resources dominated by English/Western frameworks, creating gaps in representing patient distress expressions in Indian languages.

Method: Graph-based methods to build cross-lingual mental health ontologies that capture culturally embedded expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with clinical terminology.

Result: A framework (CL-PDE) that addresses gaps in healthcare communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations for more inclusive mental health care tools.

Conclusion: The approach enables more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in multilingual contexts by providing culturally valid representations of distress expressions.

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU nursing documentation suffers from inconsistent terminology and lack of standardization, particularly critical in heart failure care, requiring improved quality and standardization.

Method: Applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to adapt Mistral-7B using 8,838 heart failure nursing notes from MIMIC-III and 21,210 preference pairs from expert-verified sources.

Result: BLEU increased 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore improved 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), expert ratings rose significantly across accuracy (+14.4), completeness (+14.5), logical consistency (+14.1), readability (+11.1), and structural clarity (+6.0).

Conclusion: DPO can align lightweight clinical language models with expert standards, enabling privacy-preserving AI-assisted documentation to reduce administrative burden and improve ICU patient safety.

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Motivation: LLMs' potential is underexplored in structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge.

Method: A multi-agent system with specialized agents (Problem Analysis, Geometry, Translation, Model Validation, Load) powered by Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model, decomposing structural analysis into subtasks with expert-defined rules.

Result: Experimental evaluations on 20 benchmark problems show over 80% accuracy in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

Conclusion: The developed LLM-based multi-agent system successfully automates finite element modeling for 2D frames, demonstrating high accuracy and superiority over other LLM models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: Self-Filtered Distillation framework uses LLM-generated rationales as trust signals with three unsupervised metrics (Self-Consistency, Class Entailment Alignment, LLM Agreement Scoring) to improve patent classification accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated rationales often contain logical errors and domain misalignments, making direct supervision risky for training stability and noise propagation in patent classification.

Method: Proposes selective distillation using three trust metrics: Self-Consistency across multiple generations, Class Entailment Alignment with patent definitions, and LLM Agreement Scoring for rationale-label plausibility.

Result: Outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation on USPTO-2M dataset in accuracy, stability, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Establishes reliable paradigm for using reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics rather than treating LLM rationales as ground-truth supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluation of LLMs in multi-turn conversations is costly and hard to reproduce, creating need for reliable automated alternatives using simulated users.

Method: Created SimulatorArena benchmark with 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on math tutoring and document creation tasks, evaluating simulators on message matching and rating alignment.

Result: Profile-conditioned simulators achieved Spearman's ρ of 0.7 on both tasks, closely aligning with human judgments. Used best simulators to benchmark 18 assistants including latest LLMs.

Conclusion: Profile-conditioned simulators provide a practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation for assessing LLM performance in interactive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners face uncertainty in selecting optimal LLM configurations for downstream tasks, as different agents exhibit complementary strengths and larger models aren't always superior, creating need for adaptive routing mechanisms.

Method: Convert QA instances into knowledge graphs encoding queries, entities, and agents; train heterogeneous GNN to propagate information and produce task-aware routing distributions; use soft supervision and weighted aggregation of agent outputs.

Result: Framework consistently outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines, generalizing across benchmarks and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: Graph-supervised multi-agent routing is effective and robust for question answering, capturing complementary strengths of diverse agents through principled collaboration schemes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

Method: Fully vectorized GPU implementation using PyTorch with memory-efficient n-gram counting via torch.unique to create compact batch-specific dictionaries, avoiding traditional hashing memory costs.

Result: Achieved 13x speedup on NVIDIA T4 GPUs and over 40x speedup on NVIDIA A100 GPUs compared to NLTK's CPU-based BLEU calculation.

Conclusion: TensorBLEU transforms evaluation from a significant bottleneck to negligible overhead, accelerating research in RL-based model fine-tuning and other areas requiring efficient in-training metrics.

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

*Cassie Huang,Stuti Mohan,Ziyi Yang,Stefanie Tellex,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces fine-grained natural language constraints to planning benchmarks, revealing that LLMs' planning performance drops significantly when faced with realistic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard planning benchmarks lack realistic constraints, potentially overestimating LLMs' planning abilities and raising safety concerns in downstream applications.

Method: Augmented widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated, fine-grained natural language constraints across four formally defined categories, testing 4 LLMs, 3 formal languages, 5 methods, and 4 datasets.

Result: Introduction of constraints consistently halves performance and significantly challenges robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Conclusion: Current LLM planning capabilities are overestimated due to simplistic benchmarks, and realistic constraints reveal significant performance degradation and robustness issues.

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANTERN is a knowledge distillation framework that creates smaller, more efficient models for job-person fit assessment and explanation tasks, achieving better performance than direct LLM applications while reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying large language models for job-person fit tasks at LinkedIn faces challenges with quality, structured outputs, high latency, and scalability limitations for online deployment.

Method: Uses multi-level knowledge distillation from a black box teacher model to multiple downstream models (encoder for classification, decoder for explanation), incorporating data and logit level insights, plus post-training techniques and prompt engineering.

Result: Significantly improves task-specific metrics for job person fit and explanation, with online evaluation showing 0.24% increase in apply rate and 0.28% increase in qualified applications.

Conclusion: LANTERN successfully addresses the challenges of deploying LLMs for domain-specific applications by creating efficient, high-performance models through knowledge distillation and specialized techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

*Ceyhun Efe Kayan,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PDS is a test-time method that amplifies LLM reasoning without instructions by using reasoning prototypes from activation differences between CoT and neutral prompts, improving accuracy across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs rely on explicit reasoning instructions or static steering methods, creating a gap for adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification.

Method: Clustering activation differences between Chain-of-Thought and neutral prompts to create reasoning prototypes, then projecting input's hidden state onto these prototypes to form instance-specific steering vectors.

Result: Consistently improves accuracy on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks without fine-tuning or prompt engineering, with gains persisting even when CoT is suppressed.

Conclusion: Dynamic, prototype-guided steering serves as a lightweight alternative to training-time approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: CAM is a Constructivist Agentic Memory system inspired by Piaget's theory that helps LLMs better comprehend long documents through structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and dynamic accommodation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with overwhelming information volume in long-form documents, requiring a cohesive memory module to transform them into autonomous reading agents.

Method: Developed CAM with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm for structured memory development, supporting hierarchical summarization and online batch integration, with adaptive memory exploration during inference.

Result: Demonstrates dual advantages in both performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension tasks including QA, query-based summarization, and claim verification.

Conclusion: The constructivist blueprint provides a systematic path toward more robust and efficient memory systems for LLM-based reading comprehension.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for secure, domain-specific knowledge extraction and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, particularly for operations and maintenance intelligence where traditional text-chunk RAG has limitations in global sensemaking.

Method: Built structured Knowledge Graph from OMIn dataset and integrated it into retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, evaluated locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) using stronger models as judges.

Result: KEO significantly improved global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remained effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval.

Conclusion: KG-augmented LLMs show promise for secure, domain-specific QA and have potential in high-stakes reasoning applications.

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

### [49] [H1B-KV: Hybrid One-Bit Caches for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05529)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H1B-KV is a hybrid KV cache compression method that uses 1-bit binary sketches for keys and 4-bit quantization for values, achieving 70x memory reduction while maintaining performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs requires caching growing KV pairs, making long-context inference memory-bound. Existing methods like quantization, token eviction, or key-only compression provide incomplete solutions by leaving components uncompressed or discarding context.

Method: Hybrid approach combining 1-bit binary sketches for key vectors (enabling hardware-friendly bitwise attention) and 4-bit quantization for value vectors, followed by lightweight finetuning.

Result: Achieves 70x memory reduction (7B LLM handles 8k-token context with <60MB cache), matches full-precision performance on perplexity benchmarks and complex tasks (GSM8K, MMLU, HumanEval), and outperforms leading methods in quality-per-byte.

Conclusion: H1B-KV establishes a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained environments through comprehensive KV cache compression without sacrificing context or performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

*Yao Xiao,Jung-jae Kim,Roy Ka-wei Lee,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how prompt difficulty affects self-play preference optimization in LLMs, finding that difficult prompts degrade performance and that selectively removing challenging prompts improves overall results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference optimization, as the role of prompts remains underexplored despite being a core component in the alignment pipeline.

Method: Used mean reward of N sampled responses as a proxy for prompt difficulty, analyzed performance differences between easy and difficult prompts, and explored strategies including selective removal of challenging prompts.

Result: Difficult prompts show substantially inferior optimization performance, incorporating them degrades overall performance, and the performance gap closes with increased model capacity. Selective removal of challenging prompts enhances overall self-play performance.

Conclusion: Prompt difficulty significantly impacts self-play optimization, and strategic management of prompt difficulty through selective filtering can improve alignment performance in language models.

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Motivation: Address memory and computing challenges in deploying large language models and vision-language models while maintaining performance.

Method: Propose Pareto-Guided SVD (PGSVD) - a zero-shot pipeline with theoretical bounds on network loss, bi-objective optimization formulation, and alternating least-squares implementation.

Result: Better accuracy at same compression levels and inference speedup when applied to LLM and VLM.

Conclusion: PGSVD provides an effective low-rank compression framework that bridges theoretical guarantees with practical performance improvements for large models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Motivation: Existing automated methods for academic paper promotion struggle with limited storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment, making efficient and engaging dissemination difficult.

Method: Introduces EvoPresent framework with PresAesth - a multi-task reinforcement learning aesthetic model that provides aesthetic scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback for iterative self-improvement.

Result: Created EvoPresent Benchmark with 650 top-tier AI conference papers and 2,000 slide pairs. Found that high-quality feedback is essential for self-improvement, automated generation shows trade-off between visual design and content, and multi-task RL training has stronger generalization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses academic presentation challenges through unified narrative coherence, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic delivery via virtual characters with iterative self-improvement capability.

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

Result: Achieved 54.47% F1 score on HotpotQA and 70.05% on StrategyQA, surpassing best baselines by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively.

Conclusion: FGDIP demonstrates versatility and potential to significantly enhance language agents' performance in multi-hop reasoning tasks through its dynamic and adaptive approach.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance

Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with brainless trial-and-error and hallucinatory actions due to lack of global planning in long-horizon tasks.

Method: Two-step training: 1) Synthesize high-quality plans from advanced LLM using homologous consensus filtering and fine-tuning, 2) Improve planner with rule-based reinforcement learning using executor capability gain reward.

Result: Executor agents equipped with EAGLET planner outperform existing methods on three long-horizon tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 8x lower training costs than RL baselines.

Conclusion: EAGLET provides an efficient and effective solution for enhancing LLM agents' planning abilities without manual effort or extra training data.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training

TL;DR: A multi-agent debate framework using MLLMs that iteratively refines implicit attribute value extraction through debate rounds, significantly improving accuracy on multimodal e-commerce data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit AVE is challenging due to complex multimodal data and vision-text understanding gaps in existing MLLMs, requiring more robust approaches.

Method: Multi-agent debate framework with multiple MLLM agents that iteratively verify and update each other's responses through debate rounds.

Result: Experiments on ImplicitAVE dataset show significant accuracy improvements, especially for low-performing attributes, with even few debate rounds.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate strategies effectively address single-agent limitations and provide scalable solution for implicit AVE in multimodal e-commerce.

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

Method: Code-switching in-context learning (CSICL) progressively transitions from target language to English within demonstrations and instructions to facilitate latent reasoning in English, acting as an implicit linguistic bridge.

Result: CSICL consistently outperforms X-ICL baselines across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, achieving gains of 3.1%p in target languages and 1.9%p in unseen languages, with even larger gains (14.7% and 5.3%) in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Code-switching is a principled and robust approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

TL;DR: DecEx-RAG improves Agentic RAG by modeling it as an MDP with decision-making and execution, using process-level policy optimization and efficient pruning to enhance task decomposition, retrieval, and answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of outcome-supervised reinforcement learning in Agentic RAG, including inefficient exploration, sparse rewards, and ambiguous global feedback.

Method: Model RAG as Markov Decision Process with decision-making and execution components, introduce efficient pruning strategy for data expansion optimization, and apply comprehensive process-level policy optimization.

Result: Achieves 6.2% average absolute performance improvement across six datasets and improves data construction efficiency by nearly 6x compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: DecEx-RAG provides an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training, significantly enhancing LLMs' autonomous capabilities in complex task processing.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is

TL;DR: Development of a methodology for generating multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities using NLP techniques and LLM validation to create standardized synonym sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create comprehensive mappings of astronomical observation facilities from multiple semantic artifacts for integration into astronomy platforms and standards.

Method: Compute similarity scores using adaptable criteria and NLP techniques (Bag-of-Words, sequential, surface approaches) on entities from eight semantic artifacts including Wikidata, then use LLM to validate mapping suggestions with justifications.

Result: Generated multi-source synonym sets with standardized labels per entity, ensuring plausibility and FAIRness of validated synonym pairs.

Conclusion: The resulting mappings will be integrated into the Name Resolver API, IVOA Vocabularies, and OntoPortal-Astro platform to support astronomical research and data interoperability.

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro
platform.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes InfoNCE gradient norms using spectral bands, introduces spectrum-aware batch selection with a greedy algorithm, and shows improved training efficiency on ImageNet and CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize the training dynamics of contrastive learning methods by analyzing gradient norms through spectral properties and batch composition.

Method: Derived non-asymptotic spectral bounds for InfoNCE gradients, used effective rank as anisotropy proxy, designed spectrum-aware batch selection with greedy builder, and implemented in-batch whitening.

Result: Greedy-64 reduced time-to-67.5% top-1 accuracy by 15% vs random on ImageNet-100, with similar gains on CIFAR-10. In-batch whitening reduced 50-step gradient variance by 1.37x.

Conclusion: Spectrum-aware batch selection and in-batch whitening significantly improve contrastive learning efficiency by optimizing gradient properties and reducing variance.

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

*Jianbin Shen,Christy Jie Liang,Junyu Xuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel learning approach for abstractive text summarization that improves informativeness through optimal transport-based attention and named entity entropy reduction, achieving better ROUGE scores on CNN/Daily Mail and competitive results on XSum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for more informative text summaries in the Big Data era, particularly improving informativeness in abstractive summarization where current methods still have room for enhancement.

Method: Two-method approach: 1) optimal transport-based informative attention to focus on key information in reference summaries, 2) accumulative joint entropy reduction on named entities to enhance informative salience.

Result: Achieved better ROUGE scores on CNN/Daily Mail dataset compared to prior work, competitive results on XSum dataset, and demonstrated superior informativeness in human evaluation over strong baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves informativeness in abstractive text summarization through novel attention mechanisms and entity-focused optimization, with experimental validation across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

TL;DR: MoNE (Mixture of Neuron Experts) achieves comparable performance to traditional MoE models while activating only 50% of parameters, improving inference efficiency through neuron-granular expert selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observed that parameters activated by MoE layers remain highly sparse at inference, with most neuron activations near zero, suggesting potential for more efficient parameter utilization.

Method: Proposed MoNE which performs neuron-granular expert selection using simple top-k selection within each expert, requiring no additional routing parameters or inter-expert communication.

Result: MoNE matches traditional MoE performance with only 50% activated parameters, and consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at equal numbers of activated parameters.

Conclusion: MoNE is a practical approach to improve parameter utilization and inference efficiency in MoE-like models with negligible latency overhead.

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

TL;DR: TKTO is a token-level preference optimization method for TTS that eliminates the need for paired utterance data and enables fine-grained pronunciation alignment without token-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS preference optimization methods require paired desirable/undesirable utterance samples, which are limited in TTS data, and cannot provide fine-grained token-level optimization needed for accurate pronunciation alignment.

Method: Proposed TKTO method eliminates the need for paired data and directly targets token-level units, automatically providing fine-grained alignment signals without requiring token-level annotations.

Result: TKTO improved Japanese TTS accuracy by 39%, reduced CER by 54%, and automatically assigned 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

Conclusion: TKTO enables more data-efficient training and provides fine-grained token-level optimization for TTS systems, significantly improving pronunciation accuracy and alignment.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Qizhou Wang,Bo Han,Jing Bai,Hinrich Schutze,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEPO introduces a two-stage rollout with adaptive unlearning to balance exploration and exploitation in RLVR for LLMs, preventing entropy collapse and achieving significant performance gains over GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods overemphasize exploitation, leading to entropy collapse and diminished exploratory capacity, creating a self-reinforcing loop that limits performance gains.

Method: Two-stage rollouts with adaptive unlearning: first stage generates half trajectories, then lightweight unlearning suppresses sampled responses, forcing second stage to explore different output regions.

Result: Outperforms GRPO across five reasoning benchmarks with average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

Conclusion: EEPO's sample-then-forget mechanism effectively disrupts self-reinforcing loops and promotes wider exploration, addressing the exploration-exploitation balance challenge in RLVR for LLMs.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the English-centric bias in LLMs and the significant performance gap for French in Small Language Models, where existing multilingual models show much lower French performance and efficient adaptation methods for French are limited.

Method: Targeted post-training on curated, high-quality French data and strategic model merging to enhance performance in both French and English.

Result: Luth models outperform all open-source counterparts of comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining original English capabilities, establishing new state-of-the-art for French SLMs.

Conclusion: Luth provides a robust baseline for future French-language research and demonstrates that strategic adaptation methods can effectively address language performance gaps in SLMs.

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

TL;DR: Continual pre-training improves LLMs for conversational summarization without requiring labeled data, achieving gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in specialized domains like conversational data, and fine-tuning requires costly labeled data. Continual pre-training offers a scalable, self-supervised alternative.

Method: Use large-scale unlabeled business conversation data for continual pre-training of LLMs, with analysis of different data selection strategies.

Result: Substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: Continual pre-training is an effective approach for adapting LLMs to conversational summarization tasks, with practical guidelines provided for industrial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates automated contract generators' impact on privacy policy compliance using a novel GPT-5-based assessment method, finding generators significantly improve compliance levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Firms struggle with digital regulation compliance, especially smaller businesses lacking resources. Automated contract generators offer cheaper alternatives to legal advice, but their prevalence and quality lack empirical evidence.

Method: Created and annotated a multilingual benchmark dataset for Swiss and EU privacy law compliance. Developed a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale compliance assessment of privacy policies.

Result: 18% of local websites use generators, which are associated with 15 percentage point higher compliance levels. Compliance increases observed after the 2023 Swiss privacy law revision.

Conclusion: Automated tools like contract generators can significantly improve legal compliance, demonstrating the potential of LLMs for cross-lingual legal analysis and the Brussels Effect of EU regulations.

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Context Denoising Training (CDT), a method to improve long-context models by detecting and mitigating contextual noise using Integrated Gradient scores, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context models are susceptible to contextual noise (irrelevant tokens) that mislead model attention, despite their ability to locate critical information in long sequences.

Method: Proposes Integrated Gradient (IG) score to detect context noise, and Context Denoising Training (CDT) strategy that improves attention on critical tokens and reinforces their influence on predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments across four tasks show CDT substantially boosts model attention on critical tokens and improves predictions. An 8B model with CDT achieves performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

Conclusion: CDT is an effective training strategy that enhances long-context model performance by mitigating contextual noise and improving attention on critical information.

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

*Faeze Ghorbanpour,Alexander Fraser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show varying sensitivity to harmful content in extended contexts, with performance peaking at moderate prevalence (0.25), declining with very sparse or dominant content, and decreasing recall with longer contexts. Detection is better for content at the beginning and for explicit vs. implicit harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs' long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios involving harmful content detection.

Method: Evaluated LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context by varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end), prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens) across harmful content categories including toxic, offensive, and hate speech.

Result: Across LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, similar patterns emerged: performance peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful sentences at the beginning are detected more reliably; and explicit content is more consistently recognized than implicit.

Conclusion: This study provides the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content in long contexts, highlighting both emerging strengths and remaining challenges for safety-critical use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on
extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation.
While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

### [70] [The fragility of "cultural tendencies" in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05869)
*Kun Sun,Rong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper critically re-evaluates LSZ's claim that LLMs display culturally specific tendencies based on prompt language, arguing their findings are fragile artifacts rather than stable cultural traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge LSZ's interpretation that LLMs encode deep-seated cultural patterns and show cultural shifts based on prompt language alone.

Method: Conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and more test items to test the robustness of LSZ's findings.

Result: Found that prompt language has minimal effect on outputs, contradicting LSZ's claims about substantial cultural shifts.

Conclusion: The reported 'cultural tendencies' are not stable traits but fragile artifacts of specific models and task design, challenging LSZ's claim that models encode grounded cultural beliefs.

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-turn interactions due to reliance on incorrect early assumptions and failure to track user goals over time, while prior research shows long-term planning is crucial for interactive tasks.

Method: Propose a prompt optimization framework that modifies task instruction prompts using turn-by-turn feedback and experience replay for prompt rewriting, enabling long-term planning without parameter updates.

Result: Significant improvement in multi-turn tasks like text-to-SQL and task-oriented dialogue, with generalization across different LLM-based agents and ability to leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimization approaches for enhancing LLM performance in interactive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

Method: Developed a four-part framework to categorize cultural framing in benchmarks, qualitatively analyzed 20 cultural benchmarks, and identified six methodological issues. Proposed improvements based on anthropological methods.

Result: Identified six recurring methodological problems in cultural benchmarks: treating countries as cultures, overlooking within-culture diversity, relying on oversimplified survey formats, and other issues that misrepresent cultural complexity.

Conclusion: Cultural benchmarks should be improved by incorporating real-world narratives, involving cultural communities in design, and evaluating models in context rather than isolation to better capture responses to complex cultural situations.

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

### [73] [EvalMORAAL: Interpretable Chain-of-Thought and LLM-as-Judge Evaluation for Moral Alignment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05942)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Anastasia Giachanou,Ayoub Bagheri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvalMORAAL is a transparent CoT framework that evaluates moral alignment in 20 LLMs using two scoring methods and model-as-judge peer review, revealing significant regional bias between Western and non-Western regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a transparent framework for evaluating moral alignment in large language models across different cultural contexts, addressing the need for culture-aware AI assessment.

Method: Uses chain-of-thought with two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus model-as-judge peer review on World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics) and PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics).

Result: Top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r≈0.90 on WVS), but show clear regional bias: Western regions average r=0.82 vs non-Western r=0.61 (0.21 gap). Peer review flagged 348 conflicts and peer agreement correlates with survey alignment.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting persistent regional bias challenges, supporting automated quality checks through peer agreement metrics.

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

*Sunbowen Lee,Qingyu Yin,Chak Tou Leong,Jialiang Zhang,Yicheng Gong,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can internally perceive problem difficulty through their representations, with specific attention heads showing opposite activation patterns for simple vs. difficult math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations, which is essential for adaptive reasoning and efficient resource allocation.

Method: Used linear probes on final-token representations of LLMs and located specific attention heads in the final Transformer layer that show opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems.

Result: Problem difficulty can be linearly modeled from LLM representations, and specific attention heads successfully distinguish difficulty levels through opposite activation patterns.

Conclusion: Difficulty perception in LLMs is structurally organized and present, offering practical applications for automatic difficulty annotation and reducing human labeling costs in benchmark construction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

*Periklis Mantenoglou,Rishi Hazra,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LexiCon is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on constrained planning tasks by adding temporal constraints to existing planning environments and translating them to natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to be evaluated on constrained planning tasks for real-world deployment where safety constraints are critical, as current testing focuses mainly on unconstrained domains.

Method: Take existing planning environments, impose temporal constraints on states, translate constrained problems into natural language, and test LLMs on solving them. The benchmark is extensible to new environments.

Result: Performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT-5, o3, R1) deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness in planning tasks increases.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with constrained planning tasks, highlighting the need for better evaluation benchmarks like LexiCon to assess their real-world applicability.

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

*Timothy Pistotti,Jason Brown,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues that direct minimal pair comparisons are more transparent than Difference-in-Differences metrics for evaluating LLMs' syntactic knowledge. Using GPT-2 and refined parasitic gap stimuli, the authors show the model succeeds across all conditions, contrasting with previous DiD-based findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address divergent conclusions in recent studies about LLMs' ability to learn complex syntax, particularly regarding the transparency of different evaluation metrics (minimal pairs vs. DiD) for assessing syntactic competence.

Method: Generated an 8-permutation paradigm of refined parasitic gap stimuli and evaluated GPT-2 using a systematic Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis (direct minimal pair comparisons) across four conditions.

Result: GPT-2 succeeded across all four tested conditions, demonstrating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing principles in complex parasitic gap environments, contrary to previous DiD-based findings.

Conclusion: The choice of evaluation metric is critical for assessing LLMs' syntactic competence, with direct minimal pair approaches offering greater diagnostic transparency than DiD-style metrics.

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

*Qin Dong,Yuntian Tang,Heming Jia,Yunhang Shen,Bohan Jia,Wenxuan Huang,Lianyue Zhang,Jiao Xie,Shaohui Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASA proposes a multi-A single-B LoRA variant that uses multiple specialized down-projection experts to overcome representational bottlenecks, achieving better performance than standard LoRA with comparable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix creates a representational bottleneck that is insufficient for capturing diverse signals in complex tasks.

Method: MASA implements a multi-A, single-B structure where multiple specialized down-projection experts are asymmetrically shared across layers, with a single layer-specific up-projection matrix for integration.

Result: On MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves 59.62% average accuracy, outperforming standard LoRA by 1.08 points (1.84% relative improvement) with comparable 0.52% learnable parameters.

Conclusion: The multi-A expert ensemble approach effectively enriches feature adaptation and improves downstream task performance while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

*Timothy Pistotti,Jason Brown,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-2 shows improved syntactic performance on refined stimuli, suggesting stimulus quality affects LLM evaluation results in poverty of stimulus arguments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why recent LLM studies on Argument from Poverty of Stimulus (APS) show conflicting results, focusing on how stimulus characteristics like lexical ambiguities and structural complexities might confound model performance.

Method: 1) Establish baseline performance on existing stimuli (filtered and unfiltered), 2) Generate new refined dataset using Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview with linguistically-informed templates to mitigate confounds, 3) Evaluate GPT-2 on both datasets.

Result: GPT-2 demonstrates notably improved performance on refined stimuli compared to baselines, indicating stimulus quality significantly influences surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Conclusion: Stimulus characteristics and quality play a crucial role in LLM syntactic evaluation, and refined stimuli can reveal better model competence than previously thought in poverty of stimulus arguments.

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniDoc-Bench is the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains, featuring 1,600 multimodal QA pairs with expert validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MM-RAG evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases.

Method: Developed a pipeline to extract and link evidence from text, tables, and figures from real-world PDFs, then generated multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries with expert validation.

Result: Multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, showing that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for
applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases,
yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in
isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture
document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce
UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from
70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links
evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA
pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical
reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by
multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports
apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)
image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint
retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,
prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal
text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly
multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images
alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.
Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context
complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers
actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

TL;DR: CB-ECLLM is a comprehensive benchmark for Chinese LLMs using the CDTP dataset with 7M aligned text-triple pairs across 4 domains, addressing the lack of structured Chinese data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese LLMs face challenges due to dominance of unstructured text and lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora, with existing benchmarks being English-centric and not addressing Chinese linguistic characteristics.

Method: Constructed Chinese Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset with over 7 million aligned text pairs and 15 million triples spanning four domains, enabling multi-task evaluation including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text generation, and Question Answering.

Result: The benchmark enables fine-grained evaluation for knowledge-driven tasks and supports multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness across different scenarios.

Conclusion: CB-ECLLM addresses the gap in structured Chinese data evaluation, provides open-source codebase for reproducible research, and outlines future directions for Chinese LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASPO addresses token-level clipping issues in LLM reinforcement learning by flipping importance sampling ratios for positive-advantage tokens and using dual-clipping to stabilize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM post-training methods using Outcome-Supervised RL have flawed importance sampling ratios that cause unbalanced token weighting, suppressing low-probability tokens while over-amplifying high-probability ones.

Method: Proposed Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO) flips IS ratios for positive-advantage tokens and incorporates soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining gradient flow.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks show ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence, improves training stability, and enhances final performance over GRPO-based baselines.

Conclusion: ASPO provides new insights into token-level weighting in OSRL and demonstrates the critical importance of correcting importance sampling in LLM reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Post-training improves instruction-following but harms models' ability to handle tasks with multiple valid answers. The paper introduces Spectrum Suite for evaluating distributional modeling and proposes Spectrum Tuning to improve steerability and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training methods enhance instruction-following but degrade performance on tasks requiring flexible adaptation to diverse valid outputs and distributional alignment.

Method: Introduces Spectrum Suite (40+ data sources, 90+ tasks) and Spectrum Tuning - a post-training method using this suite to improve steerability and distributional coverage.

Result: Spectrum Tuning improves over pretrained and instruction-tuned models, enhancing steerability, output space coverage, and distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

Conclusion: While standard post-training helps elicit capabilities, it hurts in-context steerability. Spectrum Tuning addresses this limitation and improves distributional modeling properties.

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

TL;DR: Study reveals a 'valley of code reasoning' phenomenon where competitive coding performance first drops then sharply increases with more distillation data, and finds that question difficulty matters more than answer correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model performance scales with the quantity of distillation data for code reasoning skills, as there's limited research on this scaling trend.

Method: Distilled competitive coding skills into two small non-reasoning LLMs, studied scaling trends, and conducted additional fine-tuning experiments at different distillation stages to analyze learning phases.

Result: Identified a 'valley of code reasoning' pattern where performance initially decreases then increases sharply with more data. Found that easier coding questions benefit small models more than harder ones, and correctness of training outputs doesn't affect distillation outcomes.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of code reasoning distillation training dynamics beyond intuition, revealing important scaling patterns and learning behaviors in small models.

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside
intuition

*Gagan Bhatia,Somayajulu G Sripada,Kevin Allan,Jacobo Azcona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the architectural origins of LLM hallucinations, proposing Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST) to trace internal semantic failures, identifying a 'commitment layer' where hallucinations become inevitable, and revealing a conflict between associative and contextual pathways that causes predictable failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs generate plausible but factually incorrect statements (hallucinations) by examining their intrinsic architectural mechanisms rather than just external factors.

Method: Proposed Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST) framework that integrates interpretability techniques to create causal maps of model reasoning. Identified a specific 'commitment layer' where hallucinations become irreversible and analyzed computational pathway conflicts using dual-process theory.

Result: Found that hallucinations become inevitable at a specific commitment layer. Identified conflict between associative (System 1-like) and contextual (System 2-like) pathways, with reasoning shortcut hijacks as predictable failure modes. Demonstrated strong negative correlation (ρ = -0.863) between contextual pathway coherence and hallucination rates.

Conclusion: Hallucinations are predictable consequences of internal semantic weaknesses in Transformer architecture, resulting from conflicts between fast associative and slow contextual computational pathways. The framework provides a mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

*Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel tokenizers align monolingual tokenizer vocabularies using bilingual dictionaries to ensure semantically equivalent words share the same indices, improving cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings, preventing shared representations and limiting cross-lingual generalization.

Method: Train tokenizers monolingually and then align their vocabularies exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation to ensure consistent indices for semantically equivalent words.

Result: Models trained with parallel tokenizers outperform conventional multilingual baselines across sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding similarity tasks on thirteen low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Rethinking tokenization through parallel tokenizers is essential for advancing multilingual representation learning, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

*Kangyu Wang,Zhiyun Jiang,Haibo Feng,Weijia Zhao,Lin Liu,Jianguo Li,Zhenzhong Lan,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CreditDecoding is a training-free parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates diffusion LLMs by using historical logit information (Trace Credit) to reduce redundant iterations, achieving 4-5x speedup while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion LLM approaches suffer from redundant iterations due to repetitively remasking tokens with low initial confidence scores, limiting decoding acceleration.

Method: Proposes Trace Credit to quantify token convergence potential by accumulating historical logits, and CreditDecoding algorithm that fuses current logits with Trace Credit to accelerate confidence convergence of correct but underconfident tokens.

Result: Achieves 5.48x speedup with 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and 4.11x speedup with 0.15 improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct on eight benchmarks. Scales effectively to long sequences and is orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations.

Conclusion: CreditDecoding provides a readily integrable and versatile solution that significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding robustness in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

### [87] [RoSE: Round-robin Synthetic Data Evaluation for Selecting LLM Generators without Human Test Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06143)
*Jan Cegin,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Jakub Simko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoSE is a proxy metric that selects the best LLM for generating synthetic training data without requiring human annotations, by training small models on candidate LLM outputs and evaluating them on synthetic examples from other LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate synthetic data for low-resource languages, but selecting the best LLM generator is challenging due to the high cost of human annotations for extrinsic evaluation and poor correlation of intrinsic metrics with downstream performance.

Method: RoSE trains a small model on outputs from a candidate LLM generator, then evaluates it on synthetic examples from all other candidate LLMs. The mean performance across these evaluations serves as the RoSE score for selecting the optimal generator.

Result: Across 6 LLMs, 11 languages, and 3 tasks, RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than intrinsic heuristics, coming within 0.76 percentage points of the optimal baseline and achieving the only positive correlation with human test data performance.

Conclusion: RoSE provides an effective proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator for synthetic data creation, especially valuable for low-resource languages where human annotations are scarce.

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

### [88] [VecInfer: Efficient LLM Inference with Low-Bit KV Cache via Outlier-Suppressed Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06175)
*Dingyu Yao,Chenxu Yang,Zhengyang Tong,Zheng Lin,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer is a vector quantization method that compresses KV cache in LLMs by suppressing outliers through transformations, achieving near-full precision performance with 2-bit quantization while significantly improving inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache introduces substantial memory overhead during LLM inference, and existing vector quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook utilization.

Method: VecInfer applies smooth and Hadamard transformations to suppress outliers in the key cache, enabling comprehensive codebook coverage of the original data distribution. It also includes an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead.

Result: VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization baselines across long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks. With 2-bit quantization, it achieves performance comparable to full precision while delivering up to 2.7× speedup in large-batch self-attention computation and 8.3× reduction in single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with 196k sequence length.

Conclusion: VecInfer effectively addresses the KV cache compression challenge by suppressing outliers through transformations, enabling aggressive quantization while maintaining performance and significantly improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

### [89] [Mixing Mechanisms: How Language Models Retrieve Bound Entities In-Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06182)
*Yoav Gur-Arieh,Mor Geva,Atticus Geiger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models use three mechanisms for entity binding and retrieval: positional (entity position), lexical (entity relationships), and reflexive (direct pointers), with positional mechanism becoming unreliable as entity count increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models bind and retrieve entities in context, especially as the complexity increases beyond simple positional mechanisms.

Method: Extensive experiments on nine models and ten binding tasks, developing a causal model combining positional, lexical, and reflexive mechanisms.

Result: The causal model achieves 95% agreement in estimating next token distributions and generalizes to longer inputs with open-ended text interleaved with entity groups.

Conclusion: Language models employ a mix of positional, lexical, and reflexive mechanisms for entity binding and retrieval, with the positional mechanism becoming unreliable in complex settings, establishing a more complete understanding of in-context reasoning.

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for scientific code generation use one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of real scientific research workflows.

Method: Created RECODE-H benchmark with 102 tasks, structured instructions, unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy. Developed ReCodeAgent framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation.

Result: Experiments with leading LLMs (GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, Gemini 2.5) show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, though challenges remain in generating complex research code.

Conclusion: RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BanglaTalk is the first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects, using a dialect-aware ASR system (BRDialect) that outperforms baselines by 12.41-33.98% and operates with low bandwidth (24 kbps) and minimal delay (4.9s).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali is a low-resource language with high dialectal diversity, but existing speech systems are not optimized for real-time use and focus only on standard Bengali, limiting accessibility for diverse speakers.

Method: Client-server architecture using Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for low-latency communication, with a dialect-aware ASR system (BRDialect) developed by fine-tuning IndicWav2Vec model on ten Bengali regional dialects.

Result: BRDialect outperforms baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on RegSpeech12 dataset, and the system operates at 24 kbps bandwidth with 4.9 seconds average end-to-end delay.

Conclusion: BanglaTalk enables inclusive and accessible speech technology for Bengali speakers through cost-effective, interactive real-time operation with minimal bandwidth usage and delay.

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

*Yen-Ju Lu,Yashesh Gaur,Wei Zhou,Benjamin Muller,Jesus Villalba,Najim Dehak,Luke Zettlemoyer,Gargi Ghosh,Mike Lewis,Srinivasan Iyer,Duc Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LST introduces latent speech patches to efficiently aggregate speech tokens, improving speech-text model performance and scaling laws by addressing the sequence length imbalance between speech and text tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-regressive speech-text models suffer from compute imbalance due to disproportionately longer speech token sequences compared to text tokens, hindering effective alignment and slowing scaling laws.

Method: The Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST) dynamically aggregates speech tokens into latent speech patches, creating higher-level units that align with text or encapsulate common speech sequences for efficiency.

Result: LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech and text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, achieving 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy on HellaSwag under compute-controlled training.

Conclusion: LST enables more data-efficient pre-training and steeper scaling laws for speech-text models through effective representational alignment and compute efficiency.

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

*Xinyu Guo,Zhengliang Shi,Minglai Yang,Mahdi Rahimi,Mihai Surdeanu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogRE is a framework for relation extraction that combines cognitive-inspired reasoning with RL optimization to improve both accuracy and explainability by generating relation keywords.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of supervision for language-based explanations in traditional relation extraction and improves one-shot RE performance by tackling poor attention focus and limited learning capability.

Method: Uses a reasoning mechanism inspired by cognitive science for relation extraction, combined with RL optimization using a novel reward function that promotes important relation keywords from an automatically constructed LLM-based dictionary.

Result: Achieves 24.65% F1 on One-shot NYT29 with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct, with RL optimization providing +23.46% absolute improvement. Human evaluation shows 54% relative increase in explanation quality ratings.

Conclusion: CogRE effectively improves both accuracy and explainability in relation extraction by combining cognitive-structured reasoning with RL optimization, generating high-quality relational keywords that align well with human judgments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes E-FPN framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of infrastructure defects using prototypical learning with attention mechanisms, achieving 82.55% F1-score with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of scarce labeled data in infrastructure inspection and the inability to learn new defect categories with little data, which is critical for efficient maintenance planning.

Method: Uses Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network with InceptionSepConv blocks, prototypical learning with masked average pooling, and attention mechanisms (global/local self-attention, cross-attention) for few-shot segmentation.

Result: Achieved 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way classification testing with 8-way 5-shot training. Self-attention provided 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables rapid adaptation to new defect types in infrastructure inspection with limited training data, leading to more efficient and economical maintenance of critical infrastructure.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel skin segmentation technique for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that improves heart rate monitoring by prioritizing skin regions while removing interference from areas like mouth, eyes, and hair, making it more resistant to movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of rPPG technology for heart rate monitoring, which is sensitive to lighting and movement, by developing better skin region selection methods in the unsupervised pipeline.

Method: Introduces a novel skin segmentation technique that detects skin regions throughout the body while removing interference areas. Evaluated on public datasets and a new SYNC-rPPG dataset representing real-world conditions.

Result: The model demonstrates prior ability to capture heartbeats in challenging conditions (talking, head rotation) and maintains low mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates where other methods fail. Shows high accuracy across diverse skin tones.

Conclusion: The technique is a promising option for real-world rPPG applications due to its robustness to movement, ability to handle challenging conditions, and accuracy across different skin tones.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAf is a novel auto-focus framework that combines spatial and spectral features for single-shot focus prediction, enabling conventional microscopes to function as efficient slide scanners with 80% faster focusing than stack-based methods while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost of Whole Slide Imaging scanners limits accessibility in healthcare settings, while existing low-cost solutions face limitations with consistent focus, time-consuming methods, or lack generalization across tissue types and staining protocols.

Method: DeepAf uses a hybrid architecture combining spatial and spectral features to automatically regress distance to optimal focal point from single images, adjusting control parameters for optimal image outcomes without requiring multiple input images.

Result: Achieves 80% reduction in focusing time compared to stack-based methods, focus accuracy of 0.18 μm (matching dual-image methods), robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions, and 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification.

Conclusion: The system enables accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings by transforming conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners while maintaining diagnostic accuracy comparable to expensive WSI scanners.

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Guidance reduces hallucinations in diffusion models by selectively sharpening the score function along artifact-causing directions while preserving semantic variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies due to excessive smoothing between data distribution modes, though some semantic interpolations are desirable for diversity.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Guidance which selectively sharpens the score function only along pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations.

Result: Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: This is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering, providing a nuanced solution to the hallucination problem in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

TL;DR: Training-free acceleration method for video generation diffusion models that reduces memory consumption through stage-specific strategies while maintaining acceptable quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cache-based acceleration methods for video generation diffusion models often lead to substantial memory surges during denoising and decoding stages, creating a need for memory-efficient acceleration techniques.

Method: Proposes three stage-specific strategies: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping, 2) Feature chunk, and 3) Slicing latents to decode, designed to reduce memory consumption while keeping time overhead lower than acceleration gains.

Result: Achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage compared to baseline, with quality degradation maintained within acceptable range.

Conclusion: The proposed LightCache method effectively accelerates video generation diffusion models while reducing memory consumption, providing a practical training-free acceleration solution.

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is

*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using thermal imaging and VLMs to reconstruct past scene states from residual heat traces left by human interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging captures invisible heat traces from human interactions, enabling recovery of past events that RGB cameras cannot detect, with applications in forensics and scene analysis.

Method: Time-reversed reconstruction using paired RGB-thermal images, coupling Visual-Language Models for scene description and constrained diffusion process for image reconstruction with semantic guidance.

Result: Successfully reconstructs plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating feasibility of time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Conclusion: This work provides a first step toward passive temporal imaging using thermal signatures, showing potential for recovering recent human activities from residual heat patterns.

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces pi-map, a method that combines object instance information from images with natural language descriptions for personalized image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable image retrieval using compound queries that combine object instance information (specified by an image) with natural text descriptions of what the object is doing or where it is located.

Method: Design a mapping network that translates from a local image embedding to a text token, which can then be combined with natural language queries for CLIP-style text encoding and image retrieval. Uses a simple training procedure that only needs to be performed once per object instance.

Result: The pi-map approach with frozen CLIP text and image encoders improves state-of-the-art performance on two personalized retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables compound query image retrieval by mapping object instances to text tokens that work effectively with CLIP encoders.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [102] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead is a framework for 3D Gaussian head avatars that enables continuous level-of-detail control by parameterizing Gaussians in 2D UV space and using multi-level feature maps, allowing dynamic adjustment of Gaussian count without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based avatars use fixed numbers of Gaussians, but practical applications require adjustable LOD to balance rendering efficiency and visual quality.

Method: Parameterizes Gaussians in 2D UV feature space with multi-level learnable feature maps, uses a neural network decoder to transform latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes, and controls Gaussian count by dynamically resampling feature maps at desired resolutions.

Result: Achieves SOTA quality in reenactment tasks at highest LOD, maintains near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At lowest LOD, uses only 6.2% of Gaussians with moderate quality degradation and nearly doubled rendering speed.

Conclusion: ArchitectHead enables efficient continuous LOD control for 3D Gaussian head avatars without retraining, providing a practical solution for balancing rendering efficiency and visual quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D action recognition method using point clouds from depth sensors and monocular depth estimation, combining point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks on voxel-mapped sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage dense 3D data from consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar for action recognition, providing an alternative to skeletal and video-based methods.

Method: Pipeline segments human point clouds from background, tracks individuals over time, performs body part segmentation, and uses point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks on voxel-mapped sequences.

Result: Achieves 89.3% accuracy on NTU RGB-D 120 dataset when combining sensor-based and estimated depth inputs in ensemble setup, outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

Conclusion: The approach is competitive with existing skeletal action recognition algorithms and demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging dense 3D data for human action recognition.

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [104] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Riemannian metric on the noise space of diffusion models to enable manifold-aware interpolation, addressing the limitation that diffusion models lack an explicit low-dimensional latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack an explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data manifold, limiting manifold-aware analysis and operations like interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods follow paths through high-density regions that are not aligned with the data manifold, leading to perceptually unnatural transitions.

Method: The authors propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold.

Result: Experiments on image interpolation show that the proposed metric produces perceptually more natural and faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Conclusion: The Riemannian metric approach successfully enables manifold-aware interpolation in diffusion models, overcoming the limitations of existing methods and producing more natural transitions that align with the learned data manifold.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork is a unified solution for expanding input/output channels in pretrained diffusion models without changing their architecture, using multiple coordinated model instances with LoRA adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current channel expansion methods for diffusion models are application-specific and difficult to adapt to new tasks or different models, limiting their flexibility.

Method: Coordinates multiple instances of base diffusion models (teammates) using a novel LoRA variation for joint adaptation and coordination, supporting dynamic activation/deactivation of teammates.

Result: Successfully applied to various graphics tasks including inpainting, SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

Conclusion: Teamwork provides a flexible and efficient unified approach for channel expansion and task adaptation in diffusion models across multiple graphics applications.

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [106] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs achieve near-human accuracy (95%, k=0.90) in grading handwritten arithmetic work but struggle with mathematical illustrations (k=0.20), though performance improves to human-level (k=0.47) when given human descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore MLLMs' potential for grading handwritten student mathematics work, which is valuable for understanding learning processes but time-consuming for human educators.

Method: Two experiments: Experiment A tested 288 handwritten arithmetic responses from Ghanaian students; Experiment B evaluated 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, testing both direct image analysis and human-description-augmented analysis.

Result: MLLMs achieved 95% accuracy on arithmetic work but only k=0.20 agreement on illustrations. With human descriptions, illustration grading improved to k=0.47, matching human-to-human agreement levels.

Conclusion: MLLMs can effectively interpret arithmetic work but still struggle with visual analysis of mathematical illustrations, suggesting their visual interpretation capabilities need improvement despite strong performance on structured tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network is a self-supervised learning architecture that learns visual representations for both object recognition and motion understanding from natural videos using latent dynamics modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods focus on either recognition or motion separately, while latent dynamics modeling has been successful in decision making but not applied to learning both recognition and motion from videos.

Method: Uses midway top-down path to infer motion latents between frames, dense forward prediction objective, and hierarchical structure to handle complex multi-object scenes in natural videos.

Result: Achieves strong performance on semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks after pretraining on large-scale natural video datasets, outperforming prior self-supervised methods.

Conclusion: Midway Network successfully extends latent dynamics modeling to learn both object recognition and motion understanding from natural videos, with learned dynamics capturing high-level correspondence.

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods fall short in critical aspects like geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties for reliable dynamic simulation.

Method: Uses an interactive scene-graph representation encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties with hierarchical relationships. Formulates reconstruction as energy-based optimization integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors. Employs hybrid optimization combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement.

Result: Produces digital twins with complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets and practical applicability in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation.

Conclusion: HoloScene effectively addresses limitations of current 3D reconstruction methods by simultaneously achieving geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, and realistic physical properties for dynamic simulation.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP is a training-free method that addresses structural limitations in VLMs by calibrating dominant tokens in visual space and differentiating concepts in textual space to improve text-driven image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer from structural limitations where a few low contribution tokens dominate global semantics and suppress discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE) to decouple visual features and suppress dominant tokens, and Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC) to differentiate between general and discriminative concepts in text queries.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: CalibCLIP effectively addresses the suppressive effect of dominant tokens and improves differentiation among similar samples in text-driven image retrieval.

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CoT reasoning approaches for image generation introduce unnecessary redundancy (visual overthinking), increasing computational costs and potentially introducing contradictory details to the original prompt.

Method: ShortCoTI uses a reinforcement learning paradigm with an adaptive reward function that scales according to task difficulty, encouraging more concise CoT sequences while preserving output quality.

Result: Reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across T2I-CompBench and GenEval benchmarks, eliminating verbose explanations and repetitive refinements.

Conclusion: ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich.

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: HOI-R1 is a method that uses reinforcement learning to train multimodal language models for human-object interaction detection without additional detection modules, achieving 2x accuracy improvement on HICO-DET dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOID methods require complex frameworks with VLMs and object detectors, while MLLMs' inherent reasoning abilities for HOID are under-explored. The authors aim to simplify the framework by using pure text reasoning.

Method: Proposes HOI-R1 that introduces HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve HOID task using reinforcement learning on multimodal language models, eliminating the need for additional detection modules.

Result: Achieves 2x accuracy improvement over baseline on HICO-DET dataset with great generalization ability.

Conclusion: HOI-R1 demonstrates that language models can effectively perform human-object interaction detection through pure text reasoning without complex detection frameworks, showing promising potential for simplified HOID approaches.

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR models require expensive fine-tuning for complex spatially-conditioned generation, which is computationally costly. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach that avoids full model retraining.

Method: Proposes ECM with: 1) Distributed architecture with context-aware attention layers and shared gated FFN, 2) Early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes learning early control sequences, 3) Temperature scheduling during inference to compensate for insufficient late-stage training.

Result: Extensive experiments show ECM achieves high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: ECM provides an efficient plug-and-play solution for spatially-conditioned AR image generation that avoids costly fine-tuning, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Motivation: Autoregressive point cloud generation has lagged behind diffusion approaches due to artificial ordering constraints that undermine global structural properties like symmetry and long-range dependencies.

Method: Proposes PointNSP framework using level-of-detail principle with coarse-to-fine generation, multi-scale factorization, and next-scale prediction to preserve global structure while refining local geometry.

Result: Establishes state-of-the-art generation quality on ShapeNet, surpassing diffusion baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency, with even better performance at high point densities (8,192 points).

Conclusion: PointNSP successfully bridges the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based point cloud generation while offering superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

*Guangrong Wan,Jun liu,Tang tang,Lianghao Shi,Wenjun Luo,TingTing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset and proposes TF-Net for automated tear film break-up segmentation, along with TF-Collab pipeline for fully automated ocular surface analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is crucial for dry eye diagnosis but faces challenges due to lack of annotated datasets and integrated solutions.

Method: Created TFM Dataset with 15 high-resolution videos and three vision tasks. Proposed TF-Net with MobileOne-mini backbone and enhanced feature pyramid network. Developed TF-Collab pipeline that orchestrates frame classification, pupil localization, and TFBU segmentation.

Result: TF-Net achieves favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. TF-Collab enables fully automated tear film analysis with real-time capability. Benchmark performance established on TFM segmentation subset.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide effective automated solutions for tear film analysis and lay foundation for future ocular surface diagnostics research.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

*Ibrahim Salihu Yusuf,Iffanice Houndayi,Rym Oualha,Mohamed Aziz Cherif,Kobby Panford-Quainoo,Arnu Pretorius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaGeo is an end-to-end framework that automates geospatial data processing, enables model distillation for compact models, and facilitates deployment as web applications, making geospatial foundation models more practical and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geospatial foundation models have limited deployment due to lack of automated data pipelines and large model sizes, hindering practical applications in humanitarian and environmental domains.

Method: InstaGeo integrates three components: (1) automated data curation from raw satellite imagery, (2) task-specific model distillation to create compact models, and (3) seamless deployment as interactive web-map applications.

Result: The framework reproduced datasets from three studies with minimal accuracy loss (-0.73pp to +1.79pp mIoU differences), created models 8x smaller than standard fine-tuned versions, and achieved state-of-the-art 60.65% mIoU for crop segmentation (12pp improvement).

Conclusion: InstaGeo transforms research-grade geospatial foundation models into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time Earth observation, enabling users to progress from raw data to deployment within a single day.

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

*Sara Mandelli,Diego Vila-Portela,David Vázquez-Padín,Paolo Bestagini,Fernando Pérez-González*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that frequency-domain artifacts are essential for deep learning-based synthetic image detectors, showing most detectors don't fundamentally rely on spectral peaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art forensic detectors truly depend on frequency-domain artifacts (spectral peaks) for detecting synthetic images, as current detectors are used as black-boxes with unclear interpretability.

Method: Proposed a strategy to remove spectral peaks from images and analyzed the impact on detectors. Also introduced a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on frequency peaks as an interpretable baseline.

Result: Findings reveal that most detectors are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging widespread assumptions in the field.

Conclusion: The study paves the way for more transparent and reliable forensic tools by questioning the fundamental reliance on spectral peaks in synthetic image detection.

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

### [117] [Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple Loss Beyond the Single Space Deep Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05643)
*Shozo Saeki,Minoru Kawahara,Hirohisa Aman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CHEST loss combining hyperbolic and Euclidean proxy-based losses with hyperbolic regularization for improved deep metric learning performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proxy-based losses are efficient for large-scale datasets but haven't been successfully applied in hyperbolic space, which can represent richer structures like hierarchies.

Method: CHEST loss combines proxy-based losses in both hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces with hyperbolic hierarchical clustering regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets and improves both accuracy and learning stability in both spaces.

Conclusion: Combining hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces in proxy-based losses enables efficient and effective deep metric learning for large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

*Saja Al-Dabet,Sherzod Turaev,Nazar Zaki,Arif O. Khan,Luai Eldweik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents two deep learning frameworks for automated diagnosis of ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP): AHP-CADNet for multi-feature integration and diagnosis, and a curriculum learning-based imputation framework for handling missing clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical assessments for AHP are subjective and complicated by incomplete medical records, leading to delayed diagnosis and secondary complications like facial asymmetry.

Method: Two deep learning frameworks: (1) AHP-CADNet with multi-level attention fusion integrating ocular landmarks, head pose features, and clinical attributes; (2) Curriculum learning-based imputation framework that progressively leverages structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to handle missing data.

Result: AHP-CADNet achieved 96.9-99.0% accuracy across classification tasks, with MAE 0.103-0.199 and R2 >0.93 for continuous variables. The imputation framework maintained 93.46-99.78% accuracy across clinical variables with PubMedBERT, showing significant improvements (p<0.001).

Conclusion: Both frameworks are effective for automated AHP diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings, demonstrating robust performance on the PoseGaze-AHP dataset.

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

*Yiping Ma,Shiyu Hu,Buyuan Zhu,Yipei Wang,Yaxuan Kang,Shiqing Liu,Kang Hao Cheong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EduVerse is a multi-agent simulation space for educational AI that enables realistic classroom dynamics through customizable environments, agents, and sessions, with human-in-the-loop integration and layered CIE architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing educational AI approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings, limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. There's a need to reproduce cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution in virtual classrooms.

Method: Built on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture with environment, agent, and session customization. Features human-in-the-loop interface allowing real users to join the simulation space.

Result: Validated in middle-school Chinese classes: instructional alignment with real classrooms (IRF rates 0.28-0.64 vs 0.37-0.49), group interaction with network density 0.27-0.40, cross-session evolution with 11.7% average increase in positive transition rate R+.

Conclusion: EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI that captures longitudinal shifts in behavior, emotion, and cognition with structured learning trajectories.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

*Manolis Mylonas,Charalampia Zerva,Evlampios Apostolidis,Vasileios Mezaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SD-MVSum extends script-driven video summarization by incorporating both visual content and spoken transcripts, using a weighted cross-modal attention mechanism to identify video segments most relevant to user-provided scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve script-driven video summarization by considering not only visual content but also the relevance between user-provided scripts and the video's spoken content, addressing limitations of previous methods that focused solely on visual information.

Method: Proposes SD-MVSum with a new weighted cross-modal attention mechanism that models dependencies between script-video and script-transcript pairs, explicitly exploiting semantic similarity to prioritize video segments with highest relevance to the script.

Result: Experimental comparisons show SD-MVSum is competitive against state-of-the-art approaches for both script-driven and generic video summarization. Two large-scale datasets (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum) were extended for multimodal training and evaluation.

Conclusion: SD-MVSum effectively leverages multimodal information (script, video, transcript) through cross-modal attention, demonstrating improved performance in script-driven video summarization by considering both visual and spoken content relevance.

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

### [121] [A Hierarchical Geometry-guided Transformer for Histological Subtyping of Primary Liver Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05657)
*Anwen Lu,Mingxin Liu,Yiping Jiao,Hongyi Gong,Geyang Xu,Jun Chen,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGUS is a novel method for liver cancer histological subtyping that captures hierarchical information from Whole Slide Images by integrating micro-geometry features, hierarchical field-of-views alignment, and geometry-guided fusion to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver cancers (HCC and ICC) are highly heterogeneous with complex tissue morphology, but existing approaches fail to adequately exploit crucial hierarchical information in WSIs regarding pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment, and geometric representation, leading to limited understanding and suboptimal subtyping performance.

Method: ARGUS captures macro-meso-micro hierarchical information by: 1) constructing micro-geometry features for cell-level patterns using geometric structure across nuclei, 2) designing Hierarchical Field-of-Views Alignment to model macro-meso level interactions, and 3) fusing features via Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for holistic phenotype interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer.

Conclusion: ARGUS provides an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice by advancing histological subtyping through comprehensive hierarchical feature representation.

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

TL;DR: A training-free method for realistically inserting humans from reference images into background scenes using pre-trained diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches treat human insertion as separate problems (location/pose determination and personalization) and require training, overlooking their interconnections.

Method: Unified training-free pipeline leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models with inversion techniques, classifier-free guidance for affordance-aware global editing, and mask-guided self-attention mechanism for identity preservation.

Result: Achieves realistic human insertions into complex scenes with excellent identity preservation of subjects' clothing and body features from single reference images.

Conclusion: First training-free method for realistic human scene insertion that demonstrates diffusion models inherently possess knowledge to place people in complex scenes without task-specific training.

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

*Daniel Gonzálbez-Biosca,Josep Cabacas-Maso,Carles Ventura,Ismael Benito-Altamirano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal approach for automated video editing of classical music concerts, addressing when to cut (temporal segmentation) and how to cut (spatial selection) using audio-visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated video editing is underexplored compared to video generation and scene understanding, especially for multicamera recordings of classical music concerts.

Method: Uses multimodal architecture with log-mel spectrograms, optional image embeddings, and temporal features through convolutional-transformer pipeline for temporal segmentation; CLIP-based encoder with constrained distractor selection for spatial selection; pseudo-labeling dataset construction.

Result: Outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and provided competitive visual shot selection.

Conclusion: Advances the state of the art in multimodal automated video editing for classical music concert recordings.

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

*M. Torrente,A. Follador,A. Calcante,P. Casati,R. Oberti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost image-based system was developed to monitor R. solani's effects on lettuce seed germination, using temporal integration in image analysis to accurately count seedlings even when overlapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of R. solani pathogen on lettuce seed germination and early development using non-destructive monitoring, overcoming limitations of traditional image analysis in complex growth scenarios.

Method: Developed a novel image analysis pipeline that integrates morphological and spatial features with temporal integration across time points, enabling robust seedling identification and counting despite overlapping leaves.

Result: R. solani infection significantly reduced germination rates and early seedling vigor. The method achieved high accuracy with R²=0.98 and RMSE=1.12, outperforming conventional segmentation in dense growth conditions.

Conclusion: Combining low-cost imaging with advanced computational tools provides scalable, non-destructive phenotyping data, with temporal integration proving crucial for accurate quantification in challenging growth scenarios.

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

*Jike Zhong,Yuxiang Lai,Xiaofeng Yang,Konstantinos Psounis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using object-level masking instead of random patches in masked image modeling to help vision transformers learn better semantic representations and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision models lag behind language models in emergent capabilities like reasoning and in-context learning, likely due to lack of semantic guidance in current ViT training schemes that rely on spatial patchification without inherent semantics.

Method: Propose modeling "object" as visual equivalent of "word" in masked image modeling, applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches to learn global context and semantics among visual elements.

Result: Object-level representation alone helps learn real-world distributions, while pixel-averaging shortcuts are learned without it. Evaluations with MLLMs on VQA, GQA, ScienceQA show strong reasoning and contextual understanding gains.

Conclusion: Object-level encoding is effective for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers, providing a plausible direction to bridge the gap between vision and language model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

*Shihao Zhu,Bohan Cao,Ziheng Ouyang,Zhen Li,Peng-Tao Jiang,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgeBooth is a novel age-specific finetuning approach that enhances age control in identity personalization models without requiring expensive age-varied datasets, using prompt blending and LoRA fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to accurately control age while preserving identity, and fine-tuning requires costly paired images across different ages.

Method: Uses age-conditioned prompt blending and age-specific LoRA fusion with SVDMix matrix fusion technique to exploit the linear nature of aging, enabling intermediate-age portrait generation.

Result: Produces realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a single reference image, achieving superior age control and visual quality compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: AgeBooth effectively enhances age control capability without expensive datasets, enabling high-quality age progression/regression from single reference images.

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free pipeline using ControlNet and Vision-Language Models generates synthetic images with pixel-level labels for one-shot semantic segmentation, outperforming existing methods on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentation struggles with high-level semantic attributes like materials and textures, while existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise performance.

Method: Integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models with Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator, and High-quality Image Selection module to generate synthetic images with pixel-level labels without manual annotation.

Result: Achieves promising performance on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets and outperforms concurrent work for one-shot semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free pipeline effectively addresses data augmentation challenges for semantic segmentation by generating diverse, high-quality synthetic data with automatic pixel-level annotations.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

### [128] [Redefining Generalization in Visual Domains: A Two-Axis Framework for Fake Image Detection with FusionDetect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05740)
*Amirtaha Amanzadi,Zahra Dehghanian,Hamid Beigy,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionDetect is a new synthetic image detection method that combines CLIP and DINOv2 features to achieve state-of-the-art performance across generators and visual domains, along with the introduction of the OmniGen benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic image detectors focus too narrowly on cross-generator generalization while ignoring the equally important challenge of generalization across visual domains. There's a need for more comprehensive evaluation and methods that address both vectors of generalization.

Method: FusionDetect leverages two frozen foundation models (CLIP and DINOv2) to derive complementary features, creating a cohesive feature space that adapts to changes in both content and generator design.

Result: FusionDetect achieves 3.87% higher accuracy and 6.13% higher precision than closest competitors on established benchmarks, plus 4.48% accuracy improvement on the new OmniGen benchmark, with exceptional robustness to image perturbations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces both a top-performing detector (FusionDetect) and a comprehensive benchmark (OmniGen) that together advance universal AI image detection capabilities across generators and visual domains.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

*Yongxuan Lyu,Guangfeng Jiang,Hongsi Liu,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALISE is a novel framework for unsupervised LiDAR instance segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations by generating pseudo-labels using Vision Foundation Models and refining them through spatio-temporal voting and semantic supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation is extremely costly and time-consuming, and current methods still rely on some form of human labeling.

Method: Uses Vision Foundation Models guided by text and images to generate initial pseudo-labels, refines them through spatio-temporal voting module combining 2D and 3D semantics, and employs 2D prior-based losses and prototype-based contrastive loss for feature learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation, outperforming MWSIS (which uses ground-truth 2D bounding box supervision) by 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Conclusion: ALISE successfully eliminates dependency on manual annotations while achieving superior performance through its comprehensive unsupervised learning framework.

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

### [130] [OneVision: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Multi-view E-commerce Vision Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05759)
*Zexin Zheng,Huangyu Dai,Lingtao Mao,Xinyu Sun,Zihan Liang,Ben Chen,Yuqing Ding,Chenyi Lei,Wenwu Ou,Han Li,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OneVision is an end-to-end generative framework that replaces traditional multi-stage cascading architecture for vision search, using vision-aligned residual quantization to align multi-view representations and improve both efficiency and conversion rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-stage cascading architecture suffers from representation discrepancies between query and product images across different stages, making it difficult to achieve optimal user experience and conversion rates simultaneously.

Method: Proposes VRQ (vision-aligned residual quantization) encoding to align different representations of objects across multiple viewpoints while preserving product distinctiveness, and uses multi-stage semantic alignment to incorporate user-specific information for personalized preference generation.

Result: Offline: performs on par with online MCA while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. Online A/B tests: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume.

Conclusion: A semantic ID centric, generative architecture can successfully unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway, demonstrating significant improvements in both efficiency and conversion metrics.

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

### [131] [A Novel Technique for Robust Training of Deep Networks With Multisource Weak Labeled Remote Sensing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05760)
*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to train deep networks using multiple weak labeled data sources with a small reliable dataset, incorporating source reliability through transition matrices to weight labels during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning requires large labeled datasets for good generalization, but reliable labels in remote sensing are costly and limited. Many weak labeled sources are available but contain errors.

Method: Combine weak labeled sources with small reliable dataset, use transition matrices describing error statistics to weight labels during training, implement as gradient-level weighting scheme.

Result: Experiments on different datasets validated effectiveness, showing robustness and capability to leverage unreliable label sources.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables training deep networks with larger datasets by effectively utilizing unreliable label sources while considering their reliability.

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

*I. M. De la Jara,C. Rodriguez-Opazo,D. Teney,D. Ranasinghe,E. Abbasnejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges conventional OOD detection approaches by revealing that intermediate layers of pre-trained models contain rich signals for detecting distributional shifts, and introduces an entropy-based method to automatically select complementary layers for improved OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most OOD detection methods treat pre-trained models as monolithic encoders and rely only on final-layer representations, missing the rich and diverse signals available in intermediate layers.

Method: Introduces an entropy-based criterion to automatically identify layers with complementary information for OOD detection without needing OOD data or training, and selectively incorporates these intermediate representations.

Result: Improves OOD detection accuracy by up to 10% in far-OOD and over 7% in near-OOD benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various model architectures and training objectives.

Conclusion: Reveals a new avenue for OOD detection research and uncovers the impact of training objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

TL;DR: A rasterization-based optimization method for Steered Mixture of Experts that accelerates 2D image regression while maintaining sparsity and quality, enabling faster parameter updates and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of Steered Mixture of Experts limits practical applications despite its strong performance in image reconstruction tasks.

Method: Combines rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering efficiency with edge-aware gating mechanism, replacing global iterative optimization with rasterized formulation.

Result: Achieves significantly faster parameter updates, more memory-efficient representations, and supports native super-resolution and denoising not possible with standard rasterized Gaussian approaches.

Conclusion: Provides a new balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for 2D image processing by combining fast rasterized optimization with edge-aware structure.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

*Sven Koehler,Sarah Kaye Mueller,Jonathan Kiekenap,Gerald Greil,Tarique Hussain,Samir Sarikouch,Florian André,Norbert Frey,Sandy Engelhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised deep learning method detects five cardiac keyframes in CMR images using motion descriptors from deformable registration, achieving improved accuracy over volume-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic methods only detect end-systole and end-diastole frames from volume curves, lacking deeper insights into myocardial motion patterns throughout the cardiac cycle.

Method: Uses dense deformable registration fields to compute 1D motion descriptors, then applies rule-based detection of keyframes from characteristic motion curves in both short-axis and four-chamber views.

Result: Achieved 30-51% improvement in SAX and 11-47% improvement in 4CH for ED/ES detection accuracy, with mean cyclic frame difference below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Enables temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics independent of cycle or phase lengths, providing comprehensive cardiac motion analysis beyond traditional volume-based approaches.

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent is a novel framework that uses optical flow motion priors to address redundancy in long-form video understanding, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding is challenging due to temporal and spatial redundancy, exacerbated by limited context length in MLLMs. Previous methods rely heavily on semantic-aware key extraction using CLIP, but motion information is underutilized.

Method: Flow4Agent uses two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) that adaptively refines frame hierarchies using coarse flow priors and semantic filtering, and Motion Token Pruning (MTP) that refines intra-frame representations by pruning redundant tokens using fine-grained optical flow.

Result: Extensive experiments show Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across video MLLM benchmarks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench, especially excelling in hour-level video understanding.

Conclusion: Incorporating motion priors from optical flow effectively addresses redundancy in long videos and significantly improves video understanding performance, demonstrating the importance of motion information alongside semantic content.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Method: Developed a platform with three components: (1) acia Python library with 8 deep learning segmentation/tracking approaches, (2) reproducible Jupyter Notebook workflows combining analysis pipelines with dependencies and visualizations, and (3) application workflows for real-world microfluidic LCI experiments.

Result: Created a collection of over ten open-source application workflows that enable analysis ranging from growth rate comparisons to minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual cell responses to changing oxygen conditions.

Conclusion: The acia-workflows platform successfully integrates powerful deep learning tools into accessible, flexible workflows that support routine application of automated live-cell imaging analysis in biological research.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and

showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insect classification is crucial for agricultural management and ecological research but remains challenging due to complex insect characteristics, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets.

Method: Uses neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically learn optimal operations for each connection in cells, stacks multiple cells for feature extraction, employs multimodal fusion to combine image embeddings with metadata, and uses alternating bi-level optimization with zero operations for efficient architecture learning.

Result: Achieved 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and 97.05% F1 score on BIOSCAN-5M dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Also obtained 93.25% accuracy on Insects-1M dataset.

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS provides accurate and confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable farming through its automated architecture search and multimodal data fusion approach.

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable

TL;DR: Proposes D3QE method for detecting images generated by autoregressive models using discrete distribution discrepancy and quantization error analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual autoregressive models create new challenges for synthetic image detection due to their unique discrete token prediction approach and improved image quality compared to GAN/diffusion methods.

Method: Uses Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D3QE) with a transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent.

Result: Achieves superior detection accuracy and strong generalization across 7 mainstream visual AR models, with robustness to real-world perturbations. Tested on comprehensive ARForensics dataset.

Conclusion: D3QE effectively exploits distinctive patterns and frequency distribution bias in codebook representations to detect autoregressive-generated images with high accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

*Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Zhiyu Ye,Jinyan Zhou,Jianfeng Cao,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WS-ICL is a weakly supervised in-context learning approach for medical image segmentation that uses weak prompts like bounding boxes or points instead of dense labels, reducing annotation effort while maintaining comparable performance to regular ICL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universal models for medical image segmentation require extensive annotations - interactive models need repeated user prompts and ICL relies on dense pixel-level labels, creating high annotation burden.

Method: Proposed Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL) that leverages weak prompts (bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels for context, eliminating need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting.

Result: WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to regular ICL models at significantly lower annotation cost on three held-out benchmarks, and is highly competitive under interactive paradigm.

Conclusion: WS-ICL establishes a promising step toward more efficient and unified universal models for medical image segmentation, with publicly available code and model.

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

*Sebastian Höfer,Dorian Henning,Artemij Amiranashvili,Douglas Morrison,Mariliza Tzes,Ingmar Posner,Marc Matvienko,Alessandro Rennola,Anton Milan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale dataset for defect detection in logistics that addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by handling diverse object poses and appearances, with 230,000+ images and 29,000+ defective instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection benchmarks like MVTec-AD and VisA are saturated (99.9% AUROC) and focus on controlled manufacturing scenarios, but fail in retail logistics due to high pose and appearance variability.

Method: Introduce a new benchmark dataset 40x larger than MVTec-AD with over 230,000 images, 29,000 defective instances, and 48,000 distinct objects to address the challenges of retail logistics anomaly detection.

Result: State-of-the-art methods achieve only 56.96% AUROC on this dataset, significantly lower than their performance on existing benchmarks, confirming the difficulty of the problem.

Conclusion: The dataset sets a new benchmark for retail logistics anomaly detection and encourages future research to address challenges posed by heavy pose and appearance variation.

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

### [141] [Shaken or Stirred? An Analysis of MetaFormer's Token Mixing for Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05971)
*Ron Keuth,Paul Kaftan,Mattias P. Heinrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive study of token mixers in MetaFormer architecture for medical imaging, showing low-complexity token mixers suffice for classification while convolutional mixers are essential for segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer architecture's success in computer vision is well-established, but its application in medical imaging remains scarce, with limited comparison of different token mixers that could offer better design choices for medical tasks.

Method: Systematic analysis of pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within MetaFormer architecture on 8 medical imaging datasets covering classification and segmentation tasks, including transfer learning from pretrained weights.

Result: For classification: low-complexity token mixers (grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient; pretrained weights remain useful despite domain gap. For segmentation: convolutional token mixers' local inductive bias is essential, with grouped convolutions preferred for reduced runtime and parameters.

Conclusion: Grouped convolutions emerge as optimal token mixers for medical imaging, providing efficiency benefits while MetaFormer's channel-MLPs handle cross-channel interactions, with different requirements for classification vs. segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light image enhancement is crucial for safety-critical applications where poor visibility can impair performance. Diffusion models have emerged as promising for LLIE due to their ability to model complex image distributions through iterative denoising.

Method: The survey proposes a multi-perspective taxonomy with six categories: Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, and Autonomous. This taxonomy maps enhancement methods across physical priors, conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency.

Result: The analysis evaluates qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. It also examines real-world deployment constraints and ethical considerations.

Conclusion: The survey aims to guide future diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and open questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the potential of foundation models.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

*Owen T. Huber,Raghu G. Raj,Tianyu Chen,Zacharie I. Idriss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Morphological Component Analysis (DMCA), a novel method that adapts video representation based on scene dynamics using eigenspace clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues to create data-driven dictionaries for separating distinct morphologies in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an adaptive video representation method that can effectively separate structurally distinct morphologies in videos by leveraging the dynamics of scene content variation, overcoming limitations of predefined dictionaries in traditional morphological component analysis.

Method: Extends morphological component analysis (MCA) by introducing eigenspace clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues to obtain data-driven dictionaries. The method learns adaptive video representations that separate distinct morphologies based on scene dynamics.

Result: DMCA demonstrates effectiveness in denoising applications on Adobe 240fps dataset videos, enhances signal-to-noise ratio of faint targets in sea states, and successfully separates bicycles from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Conclusion: Dynamic Morphological Component Analysis provides a robust framework for adaptive video representation that effectively separates distinct morphological components across various applications including video denoising, target enhancement, and radar image processing.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

### [144] [Diffusion-Based Image Editing for Breaking Robust Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05978)
*Yunyi Ni,Finn Carter,Ze Niu,Emily Davis,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models can effectively break robust image watermarks by using image regeneration processes that erase embedded watermarks while preserving visual content, demonstrating a fundamental vulnerability in current watermarking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to existing robust watermarking schemes that were designed to resist conventional perturbations.

Method: Proposes a diffusion-driven image regeneration process and a novel guided diffusion attack that explicitly targets watermark signals during generation, theoretically proving that mutual information between watermarked images and embedded payloads vanishes after sufficient diffusion-based transformation.

Result: Evaluation on multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (StegaStamp, TrustMark, VINE) shows near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack while maintaining high visual fidelity of regenerated images.

Conclusion: Current robust watermarking techniques have fundamental vulnerabilities against generative model-based attacks, highlighting the need for new watermarking strategies in the generative AI era.

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

*Moritz Alker,David C. Schedl,Andreas Stöckl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study uses multimodal large language models to measure hailstones from social media and news images, achieving 1.12cm average error with two-stage prompting that uses reference objects like human hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complement traditional hail sensors by extracting meaningful information from social media imagery for faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather events.

Method: Used 474 crowdsourced hail images from Austria (2022-2024) with hailstones 2-11cm in diameter. Compared four models using one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies, where two-stage utilizes reference objects for size cues.

Result: Pretrained models can measure hailstone diameters with average mean absolute error of 1.12cm for the best model. Two-stage prompting improves reliability compared to single-stage prompting.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf models without fine-tuning can effectively measure hailstones from images, enabling faster severe weather assessments. Automated real-time image harvesting from social media remains a future challenge.

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

*Bertram Taetz,Gal Bordelius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-loss framework for continual image captioning that combines cross-entropy with prompt-based cosine similarity, CLIP-style alignment, and contrastive losses to mitigate catastrophic forgetting without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing catastrophic forgetting and alignment challenges in continual learning for image captioning, where visual concepts evolve over time and need to stay aligned with language.

Method: Built on ViT-GPT-2 backbone, uses cross-entropy loss plus three components: prompt-based cosine similarity loss aligning images with synthetic prompts, CLIP-style loss for image-caption alignment, and language-guided contrastive loss for task discriminability.

Result: Mitigates catastrophic forgetting and achieves better semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods, with no additional inference overhead or prompts needed during generation.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-loss framework effectively addresses continual image captioning challenges by integrating semantic guidance through prompt-based learning and contrastive alignment.

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

*An Thi Nguyen,Radina Stoykova,Eric Arazo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generic instance search models can unintentionally identify individuals even when not trained on human data, raising privacy concerns. The paper evaluates technical safeguards that reduce person re-identification to below 2% while maintaining 82% retrieval performance for objects, but identifies vulnerabilities in these mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns about generic instance search models that can unexpectedly identify individuals through overlearning, even without being trained on human subjects, and the lack of clear standards for de-identification.

Method: Evaluated two technical safeguards: index exclusion and confusion loss, to reduce person re-identification capability while maintaining object retrieval performance.

Result: Combining index exclusion and confusion loss reduced person re-identification accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% retrieval performance for non-person objects, but identified vulnerabilities including circumvention using partial person images.

Conclusion: The findings highlight urgent regulatory questions about classifying and regulating systems with emergent identification capabilities, and establishing technical standards to prevent identification capabilities in seemingly benign applications.

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

*Xinye Cao,Hongcan Guo,Jiawen Qian,Guoshun Nan,Chao Wang,Yuqi Pan,Tianhao Hou,Xiaojuan Wang,Yutong Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMiner is a hierarchical framework for long video understanding that iteratively segments, captions, and clusters videos into tree structures, using T-GRPO reinforcement learning to dynamically identify key frames while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video understanding struggle with redundant information in long videos and cannot adapt to complex hierarchical structures when identifying key frames, leading to poor performance as video length increases.

Method: Proposes VideoMiner with iterative segmentation, captioning, and clustering to form hierarchical tree structures, and introduces T-GRPO (tree-based group relative policy optimization) reinforcement learning method specifically designed for tree structures to guide key frame exploration.

Result: Achieves superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks. T-GRPO spontaneously generates reasoning chains and the tree growth auxin dynamically adjusts expansion depth, providing both accuracy and efficiency gains.

Conclusion: VideoMiner effectively addresses redundant information and hierarchical structure challenges in long video understanding through its hierarchical tree approach and specialized T-GRPO reinforcement learning method.

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face modeling methods are constrained by fixed shape priors in 3D Morphable Models, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive. There's a need for methods that offer expressive geometry reconstruction without dense 3D supervision.

Method: GLVD extends Learned Vertex Descent by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints, using relative spatial encoding to iteratively refine mesh vertices.

Result: GLVD achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly competitive in multi-view scenarios, while substantially reducing inference time compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GLVD provides an effective hybrid approach for 3D face reconstruction that balances expressive geometry reconstruction with computational efficiency, eliminating the need for dense 3D supervision while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

TL;DR: Integrating MedFlamingo (medical VLM) with PPO improves robotic laparoscopic surgery performance by leveraging medical expertise for better visual feature extraction and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision-based PPO struggles with high-dimensional visual inputs, sparse rewards, and extracting task-relevant features in surgical environments.

Method: Combine MedFlamingo (medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model) with PPO, processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens.

Result: MedFlamingo PPO outperforms standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO, achieving >70% success rates across 5 laparoscopic tasks with 66.67% to 1114.29% improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: Specialized medical knowledge significantly enhances robotic surgical planning and decision-making in vision-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

*Python Song,Luke Tenyi Chang,Yun-Yun Tsai,Penghui Li,Junfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPTCHA-X is introduced as the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning annotations, showing that step-by-step reasoning significantly improves solving accuracy from 21.9% to 83.9% for vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current commercial vision-language models struggle with CAPTCHAs as high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, achieving only around 21.9% accuracy, highlighting the need for systematic study of reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces CAPTCHA-X benchmark with 7 CAPTCHA categories, step-by-step action solutions, and grounding annotations. Proposes a general agentic VLM-based framework that leverages models' inherent reasoning abilities and defines five reasoning-oriented evaluation metrics.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 83.9% average solving accuracy across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, substantially surpassing existing baselines that achieve only around 21.9% accuracy.

Conclusion: Step-by-step reasoning is crucial for solving CAPTCHAs and significantly enhances model performance. The results reveal limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning for advancing visual-spatial challenges.

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the

performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

### [153] [There is More to Attention: Statistical Filtering Enhances Explanations in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06070)
*Meghna P Ayyar,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Akka Zemmari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that combines attention maps with statistical filtering to produce sharper and more interpretable explanations for Vision Transformers, outperforming existing methods while being efficient and human-plausible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ViT explanation methods often rely on attention weights which yield noisy maps, and many CNN explanation methods transfer poorly to Vision Transformers. Attention remains valuable when properly filtered.

Method: Combines attention maps with statistical filtering (initially proposed for CNNs) to remove noisy patterns, with a class-specific variant for discriminative explanations. Uses perturbation-based faithfulness metrics and human gaze data for evaluation.

Result: Produces sharper and more interpretable maps that consistently outperform or are comparable to state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets. Shows better alignment with human perception.

Conclusion: Attention remains a valuable signal for ViT explanations when properly filtered. The proposed method provides efficient, human-plausible explanations that outperform existing approaches while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

### [154] [When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06077)
*Mi Luo,Zihui Xue,Alex Dimakis,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning often degrades video understanding performance by causing 'visual thinking drift' - generating misleading internal monologues that override correct visual intuitions. The paper introduces Visual Evidence Reward (VER) to ground reasoning in visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT has improved text reasoning but its application to video understanding is underexplored. Current approaches often generate verbose but misleading reasoning that diverges from actual visual evidence.

Method: Proposed Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks shows Video-VER consistently achieves top performance.

Conclusion: Video reasoning requires grounding inferences in visual evidence. The work encourages development of AI that 'sees while thinking' rather than just 'thinking before answering'.

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first open-source dataset with curated, high-resolution segmentations of left atrial appendage (LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) from 1000 cardiac CT scans, addressing segmentation challenges in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of LAA, CAs, and PVs remains challenging despite advanced frameworks like TotalSegmentator, and there's a need for anatomically coherent datasets to foster novel approaches for LAA morphology analysis.

Method: Used a state-of-the-art segmentation framework specifically developed for high-resolution LAA segmentation, trained on a large private dataset with manual annotations by medical readers guided by a cardiologist, then transferred to ImageCAS data. Improved CA labels from original annotations and refined PV segmentations from TS outputs.

Result: Created the first open-source dataset with curated segmentations of LAA, CAs, and PVs from 1000 CCTA scans, including identification of scans with common data flaws such as step artefacts and LAAs extending beyond scanner field of view.

Conclusion: The dataset provides valuable resources for advancing cardiac structure segmentation and enables novel approaches for LAA morphology analysis in medical imaging research.

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

### [156] [Compact Multi-level-prior Tensor Representation for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06098)
*Yinjian Wang,Wei Li,Yuanyuan Gui,Gemine Vivone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral image super-resolution method that fuses hyperspectral and multispectral images using tensor-based modeling with multi-level priors, including spectral low-rankness and spatial smoothness, optimized via an efficient algorithm with proven convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor-based fusion methods can only effectively leverage one or two priors at limited levels, struggling with model complexity and optimization when incorporating multi-level priors simultaneously.

Method: Proposes a model that decouples spectral low-rankness and spatial priors using block term decomposition, stacks spatial maps as a tensor encoding high-order spatial low-rankness and smoothness via non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation, and uses linearized alternating direction method of multipliers for optimization.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Conclusion: The method successfully incorporates multi-level priors within a tensor framework, providing an efficient optimization approach with theoretical convergence guarantees for improved hyperspectral image fusion.

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeatProto is a prototype-based multimodal framework that integrates whole slide images and genomic data for interpretable cancer survival prediction, addressing limitations in traditional prototype learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survival analysis models are difficult to interpret, reducing their clinical usefulness. Traditional prototype methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting broader tumor context and lacking semantic alignment with genomic data.

Method: Creates unified feature prototype space integrating global/local WSI features with genomic profiles. Key innovations: robust phenotype representation merging patches with global context, Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) for stable cross-modal associations, and hierarchical prototype matching capturing global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on four cancer datasets show the method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability.

Conclusion: FeatProto provides a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications, offering traceable and interpretable decision-making processes for cancer survival prediction.

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

TL;DR: MeDiM is the first medical discrete diffusion model that unifies multiple generative tasks across imaging, pathology, and clinical notes without modality-specific components, enabling high-fidelity medical generation and accurate report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios, limiting their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data.

Method: Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space using a multimodal large language model as the diffusion backbone, with key designs including removing causal attention mask for bidirectional context and injecting continuous timestep embeddings.

Result: Experiments show high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen), accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580), and enhanced downstream performance with jointly generated image-report pairs.

Conclusion: MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs, demonstrating the effectiveness of unified medical generation across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

*Zanyi Wang,Dengyang Jiang,Liuzhuozheng Li,Sizhe Dang,Chengzu Li,Harry Yang,Guang Dai,Mengmeng Wang,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowRVS proposes a novel approach for Referring Video Object Segmentation by reframing it as a conditional continuous flow problem, achieving state-of-the-art results through direct language-guided deformation from video representations to target masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RVOS methods use a 'locate-then-segment' pipeline that creates information bottlenecks by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts and struggles with temporal consistency due to decoupled language grounding and segmentation.

Method: FlowRVS reformulates RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem, learning direct language-guided deformation from video's holistic representation to target mask, leveraging pretrained T2V models for fine-grained pixel control and temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves new SOTA results: 51.1 J&F in MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in zero-shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7), demonstrating significant improvements across major RVOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: Modeling video understanding tasks as continuous deformation processes shows significant potential, with FlowRVS's one-stage generative approach effectively overcoming limitations of cascaded designs in RVOS.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Motivation: Address the lack of 3D hand annotations in diverse everyday settings for hand motion forecasting.

Method: Use diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion, and adopt diffusion loss for forecasting to handle multimodality.

Result: 14% improvement from diverse training data, 42% better lifting performance, and 16.4% gain in forecasting over baselines, with strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based approach effectively addresses annotation scarcity and multimodality in hand motion forecasting, achieving significant improvements in performance and generalization.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover time-varying 3D geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from input videos, addressing the challenge of generating dynamic 3D shapes from video data.

Method: Uses three key components based on pre-trained 3D models: temporal attention for conditioning on all frames, time-aware point sampling and 4D latent anchoring for temporal consistency, and noise sharing across frames for stability.

Result: The method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and topological transitions without per-frame optimization, showing improved robustness, perceptual fidelity, and reduced failure modes compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generates dynamic 4D shapes from videos with temporal consistency and handles complex motion and topological changes effectively.

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Motivation: To address whether video generation models can create realistic enough videos for E2E planner evaluation and how to gain deeper insights into E2E planner biases and improve generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Proposed Drive&Gen framework that bridges driving models and generative world models, using novel statistical measures with E2E drivers to evaluate video realism and exploiting video generation controllability for targeted experiments on distribution gaps.

Result: Synthetic data from video generation models effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, offering a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection.

Conclusion: The integration of generative video models with E2E driving systems enables effective virtual testing environments and facilitates expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts through improved generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

TL;DR: A novel text-to-image diffusion framework that incorporates camera EXIF metadata to generate controllable lens blur effects by mimicking the physical image formation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera metadata like aperture settings and cannot generate controllable lens blur effects based on physical camera parameters.

Method: The method first generates an all-in-focus image, estimates monocular depth, predicts focus distance using a novel focus distance transformer, and then applies a differentiable lens blur model. The entire process allows gradient flow for learning without explicit supervision.

Result: The model enables precise interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents, which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results show superior fine-grained control without altering the depicted scene.

Conclusion: This framework successfully integrates camera metadata into text-to-image generation, providing unprecedented control over lens blur effects while maintaining scene fidelity.

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

Motivation: To create a simpler and more cost-effective SLAM system that doesn't rely on active depth sensors but still achieves RGB-D-level accuracy.

Method: Uses three pretrained vision modules: monocular metric depth estimator, learned keypoint detector, and instance segmentation network. Dynamic objects are suppressed with dilated instance masks, and static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values for 3D backprojection.

Conclusion: Modern pretrained vision models can effectively replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale, enabling simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation

SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

*Yue Chen,Xingyu Chen,Yuxuan Xue,Anpei Chen,Yuliang Xiu,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human3R is a unified feed-forward framework for online 4D human-scene reconstruction from monocular videos, jointly recovering global multi-person SMPL-X bodies, dense 3D scenes, and camera trajectories in a single forward pass without iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous multi-stage pipelines that rely on iterative contact-aware refinement, human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, which are computationally expensive and complex.

Method: Builds upon CUT3R using parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning to preserve spatiotemporal priors while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Trained on synthetic BEDLAM dataset for one day on one GPU.

Result: Achieves real-time speed (15 FPS) with low memory footprint (8 GB), reconstructing multiple humans and 3D scenes in one stage. Delivers state-of-the-art performance in global human motion estimation, local human mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: Human3R serves as a simple yet strong baseline for unified human-scene reconstruction that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement, enabling easy extension for downstream applications.

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper presents biological reservoir computing (BRC) using cultured neurons as the reservoir substrate, demonstrating its effectiveness for digit classification tasks and comparing it with artificial reservoir computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate biological principles into machine learning by using living neural systems as computational substrates, exploring biologically plausible models for efficient computation.

Method: Using cultured biological neurons on a multi-electrode array (MEA) as reservoir, encoding input images via electrical stimulation, and training a linear classifier on the resulting neural activity patterns.

Result: The biological reservoir effectively supported digit classification, showing comparable performance to standard artificial reservoirs and demonstrating viability as a computational substrate.

Conclusion: Biological reservoir computing represents a viable and interpretable computational approach that bridges biological neural systems with machine learning, offering potential for biologically inspired vision systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir
computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the
reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing
(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked
activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous
stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a
subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural
responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature
space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification
using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the
biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural
activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the
performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a
standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate
that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification,
highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational
substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of
integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the
goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can
inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.

*Yilong Li,Shuai Zhang,Yijing Zeng,Hao Zhang,Xinmiao Xiong,Jingyu Liu,Pan Hu,Suman Banerjee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: NANOMIND is a hardware-software co-design framework that breaks Large Multimodal Models into modular components and maps them to optimal accelerators on SoCs, achieving significant energy and memory efficiency improvements for on-device AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs are executed monolithically, which underutilizes heterogeneous accelerators in modern SoCs and leads to high latency. There's a need for more efficient on-device execution of large models without network connectivity.

Method: Breaks LMMs into modular "bricks" (vision, language, audio), performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators, uses customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, optimized low-bit computation kernels, token-aware buffer management, and module-level coordination.

Result: 42.3% reduction in energy consumption, 11.2% reduction in GPU memory usage. Enables battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with camera for nearly half a day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to 20.8 hours.

Conclusion: The modular approach with hardware-software co-design enables efficient on-device execution of LMMs, providing higher throughput and superior power efficiency while bypassing CPU bottlenecks and reducing redundant memory usage.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision
and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost
always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous
accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end
latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design
inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models
into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its
ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into
modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.
It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on
unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level
scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our
framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs
entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent
assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher
throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The
design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage
through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system
outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy
consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a
battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a
day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TUNA, a taxonomy for analyzing user behaviors in conversational AI interactions, developed from 1193 human-AI conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing taxonomies are either too general, domain-specific, or narrow, failing to capture the full range of user practices in conversational AI interactions.

Method: Developed through iterative qualitative analysis of 1193 human-AI conversations, supplemented by theoretical review and validation across diverse contexts.

Result: Created TUNA - a three-level hierarchical taxonomy organizing user actions into categories including information seeking, synthesis, procedural guidance, content creation, social interaction, and meta-conversation.

Conclusion: TUNA provides a systematic vocabulary for describing AI use, enabling multi-scale evaluation, policy harmonization, and supporting safer, more responsive conversational systems.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of conversational AI highlights the need for frameworks
that capture not only users' instrumental goals but also the situated,
adaptive, and social practices through which they achieve them. Existing
taxonomies of conversational behavior either overgeneralize, remain
domain-specific, or reduce interactions to narrow dialogue functions. To
address this gap, we introduce the Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions (TUNA),
an empirically grounded framework developed through iterative qualitative
analysis of 1193 human-AI conversations, supplemented by theoretical review and
validation across diverse contexts. TUNA organizes user actions into a
three-level hierarchy encompassing behaviors associated with information
seeking, synthesis, procedural guidance, content creation, social interaction,
and meta-conversation. By centering user agency and appropriation practices,
TUNA enables multi-scale evaluation, supports policy harmonization across
products, and provides a backbone for layering domain-specific taxonomies. This
work contributes a systematic vocabulary for describing AI use, advancing both
scholarly understanding and practical design of safer, more responsive, and
more accountable conversational systems.

TL;DR: DeLTa is a framework for transparent object manipulation that combines depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language planning to enable precise long-horizon tasks using natural language instructions and single demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transparent object manipulation methods are limited to short-horizon tasks and basic grasping, with poor generalizability to novel objects and insufficient precision for complex manipulation tasks.

Method: Integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language planning with a single-demonstration approach that generalizes trajectories to novel objects without category priors or additional training. Includes a task planner that refines VLM-generated plans for single-arm, eye-in-hand robots.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing transparent object manipulation approaches, especially in long-horizon scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities.

Conclusion: DeLTa successfully addresses the limitations of current transparent object manipulation methods by enabling precise long-horizon manipulation of novel transparent objects through a demonstration and language-guided framework.

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday
life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to
short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have
partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in
generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon
robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration
and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework
that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language
planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by
natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its
single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel
transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional
training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the
VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand
robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon
scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities. Project page:

*Radha Gulhane,Sathish Reddy Indurthi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid reward modeling framework combining model-based and rule-based rewards for aligning multimodal LLMs with human preferences, achieving significant improvements in multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-signal, model-based reward methods for MLLM alignment lack confidence calibration, fail to capture diverse human preferences, and require extensive data annotation and training.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating model-based rewards (learned from synthetic/human feedback) and rule-based rewards (domain-specific heuristics), plus multi-aspect rewards for instruction adherence and length-penalty for training stability.

Result: 3B model achieves ~9.5% average improvement across general and math reasoning tasks, with ~16% improvement specifically on mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The hybrid reward modeling framework provides a flexible and effective approach for MLLM alignment through reinforcement learning policy optimization.

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D2E framework uses desktop gaming interactions as pretraining for embodied AI tasks, achieving high success rates on robotics benchmarks through scalable data collection and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI is limited by expensive physical data collection, while desktop gaming provides rich sensorimotor interactions at scale with structured observation-action coupling.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) OWA Toolkit for unified desktop interaction format with 152x compression, (2) Generalist-IDM for zero-shot generalization across games via timestamp-based event prediction, (3) VAPT for transferring desktop-pretrained representations to physical tasks.

Result: 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks using 1.3K+ hours of data (259h human demonstrations + 1K+h pseudo-labeled gameplay).

Conclusion: Desktop pretraining is a practical paradigm for robotics as sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks.

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAC-Opt is a backward-guided correction framework that improves LLM-generated optimization code by aligning semantic anchors between natural language descriptions and generated code, enabling fine-grained correction without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for optimization modeling rely on solver-driven methods with single-pass generation and limited post-hoc fixes, leaving undetected semantic errors that produce syntactically correct but logically flawed models.

Method: SAC-Opt uses backward-guided correction that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics. It aligns original semantic anchors with those reconstructed from generated code and selectively corrects mismatched components, enabling fine-grained refinement of constraint and objective logic.

Result: Empirical results on seven public datasets show SAC-Opt improves average modeling accuracy by 7.8%, with gains up to 21.9% on the ComplexLP dataset, enhancing both fidelity and robustness.

Conclusion: Semantic-anchored correction is crucial in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation from problem intent to solver-executable code, addressing the limitations of solver-driven approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Motivation: The rapid progress in embodied AI requires more advanced models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics safely for both agents and environments.

Method: Conducted literature review of World Models in autonomous driving and robotics, complemented by empirical analysis collecting predictions from state-of-the-art models, identifying and categorizing common faults (pathologies).

Result: Provided quantitative evaluation of results from state-of-the-art models, identifying and categorizing common pathologies in scene and control generation tasks.

Conclusion: World Models are crucial for embodied agents' ability to anticipate future states and fill knowledge gaps, but safety implications in scene and control generation must be carefully addressed through identification and analysis of common pathologies.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

TL;DR: AI models exhibit Dunning-Kruger Effect in coding tasks, with less competent models and those in rare programming languages showing stronger overconfidence bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cognitive biases like the Dunning-Kruger Effect in AI systems as they increasingly collaborate with humans in creative and technical domains.

Method: Analyzed model confidence and performance across diverse programming languages, focusing on coding tasks.

Result: AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence, especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages exhibit stronger DKE-like bias.

Conclusion: The strength of the Dunning-Kruger bias in AI models is proportionate to their competence level, similar to human cognitive patterns.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

TL;DR: VAL-Bench is a new benchmark that tests whether LLMs maintain consistent value stances across opposing framings of controversial issues, using 115K prompt pairs from Wikipedia's controversial sections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks only test rule compliance and refusal behaviors, but don't reveal whether models uphold coherent value systems when facing real-world controversial issues where outputs shape human decisions.

Method: Uses 115K paired prompts from Wikipedia's controversial sections that frame opposing sides of public debates, and measures alignment using LLM-as-judge to score agreement between paired responses.

Result: The benchmark reveals large variation in value alignment across leading open- and closed-source models, and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (refusals) and more expressive value systems.

Conclusion: VAL-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible benchmark for systematically comparing how reliably LLMs embody human values, enabling better evaluation of value consistency in controversial contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

TL;DR: AgentFlow is a trainable agentic framework that coordinates four specialized modules through memory and optimizes its planner within multi-turn interactions using Flow-GRPO, achieving superior performance across various reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-augmented LLMs use monolithic policies that scale poorly with long horizons and diverse tools, while existing agentic systems are either training-free or use offline training decoupled from multi-turn interaction dynamics.

Method: AgentFlow coordinates planner, executor, verifier, and generator modules through evolving memory. It uses Flow-GRPO for on-policy training in live environments, converting multi-turn optimization into tractable single-turn updates with group-normalized advantages.

Result: AgentFlow with 7B backbone outperforms top baselines with average gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, surpassing GPT-4o. Shows improved planning, tool reliability, and positive scaling.

Conclusion: AgentFlow's in-the-flow optimization and modular coordination effectively address long-horizon reasoning challenges, demonstrating strong performance across diverse benchmarks and superior scalability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARM is a new paradigm for automatic multi-agent system design that optimizes Chain of Thought reasoning by creating specialized reasoning modules through evolutionary tree search, achieving superior performance and generalization across models and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic MAS design techniques perform poorly, require expensive re-discovery for each new domain, and don't leverage the fundamental insight that simple CoT reasoning often competes with complex systems.

Method: Introduces Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM) - an agentic generalization of CoT where each reasoning step is executed by specialized modules discovered through tree search over code space, starting from simple CoT and evolving using mutation based on execution trace reflection.

Result: Significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods, with superb generalization across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization.

Conclusion: ARM provides a versatile reasoning building block that can be used recursively or in meta-orchestrators, demonstrating that optimizing CoT reasoning is key to effective automatic MAS design.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

*Sedat Dogan,Nina Dethlefs,Debarati Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for early prediction of meme virality using multimodal features and time-series data, achieving good performance within 30 minutes and revealing a dynamic shift in feature importance as memes gain traction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting virality of online content, especially culturally complex memes, remains challenging. The study aims to establish a robust benchmark for early virality prediction when full diffusion cascade data is unavailable.

Method: Used a large-scale cross-lingual dataset from 25 Reddit communities. Proposed a data-driven virality definition using hybrid engagement score with percentile-based threshold. Evaluated Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and MLP models with multimodal features across increasing time windows (30-420 min).

Result: XGBoost achieved PR-AUC > 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Analysis revealed an 'evidentiary transition' where feature importance dynamically shifts from static context to temporal dynamics as memes gain traction.

Conclusion: The work establishes a robust, interpretable benchmark for early virality prediction, contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and methodologically sound virality definition. This is the first study to combine time series data with static content and network features for early meme virality prediction.

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

*Dayyán O'Brien,Barry Haddow,Emily Allaway,Pinzhen Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MatheMagic creates dynamic math benchmarks by altering number/operator interpretations to test true reasoning capabilities while preventing overfitting from memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current math benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to limited diversity and closed-ended answers, and models can memorize test sets once published.

Method: Generate math test instances with altered number/operator interpretations but automatically verifiable answers, constructed dynamically at test time using random seeds.

Result: Models solve deduction tasks more easily than induction but revert to standard math; math-adapted models lack general reasoning skills, and fine-tuning on induction generalizes poorly.

Conclusion: Dynamic counterfactual benchmarks like MatheMagic can effectively reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning capabilities, showing current models' limitations in general mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAT-Graph API provides formal query execution with canonical actions for deterministic retrieval in legal RAG systems, enabling transparent and auditable query processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in reliably querying structured knowledge in legal RAG systems without sacrificing deterministic properties, particularly for high-stakes domains requiring explainable AI.

Method: Introduces canonical actions - atomic, composable, and auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic retrieval, enabling planner-guided agents to decompose complex queries into DAGs of these actions.

Result: Enables high-precision hybrid search, robust reference resolution, point-in-time version retrieval, and auditable causal tracing through a two-layer architecture.

Conclusion: Transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent, auditable process that directly addresses Explainable AI requirements for high-stakes legal domains.

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

*Haiquan Lu,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Qi Li,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixReasoning is a framework that dynamically adjusts reasoning depth in chain-of-thought models, using detailed reasoning only for difficult steps and concise inference for simpler ones to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reasoning models apply extended reasoning to every step, creating redundancy since sub-problems vary widely in difficulty - only a few pivotal steps are genuinely challenging while others are straightforward.

Method: Proposed MixReasoning framework that dynamically adjusts reasoning depth within a single response, creating a mixture of detailed reasoning for difficult steps and concise inference for simpler ones.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Adaptive reasoning depth through MixReasoning provides an effective way to optimize reasoning models by reducing redundancy while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

*Jiaru Zou,Soumya Roy,Vinay Kumar Verma,Ziyi Wang,David Wipf,Pan Lu,Sumit Negi,James Zou,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TaTToo is a novel table-grounded Process Reward Model framework that addresses limitations of existing PRMs in tabular reasoning by explicitly reasoning over table operations and integrating tool-based verification for precise reward supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs struggle with table-specific operations like sub-table retrieval and schema interaction, creating performance bottlenecks in tabular reasoning domains, which remains underexplored despite PRMs' potential for enhancing reasoning models.

Method: Developed a scalable data curation pipeline creating 60k+ step-level annotations with table verification rationales and tool executions. Trained TaTToo using dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning for tool-use reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping.

Result: Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks, TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines like Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Conclusion: TaTToo effectively addresses table-specific reasoning limitations in PRMs through explicit table-grounded reasoning and tool-based verification, achieving significant performance improvements in tabular reasoning tasks while being more parameter-efficient than larger baseline models.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient speech deepfake detection method combining prompt-tuning with signal processing transforms, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR for speech deepfake detection is parameter-inefficient and may generalize poorly to real-world data.

Method: Proposed WaveSP-Net architecture with Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end (combining wavelet transform with prompt-tuning) and bidirectional Mamba-based back-end, injecting multi-resolution features into prompt embeddings without altering frozen XLSR parameters.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb benchmarks with low trainable parameters and significant performance gains.

Conclusion: The proposed parameter-efficient approach effectively enhances localization of synthetic artifacts while maintaining model efficiency, providing a promising direction for speech deepfake detection.

Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full
fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is
not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic,
in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family
of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal
processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier
Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and
Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture
combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based
back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt
embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts
without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate
that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and
challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable
parameters and notable performance gains. The code and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the effectiveness of the human perception-production loop simulation (Machine Speech Chain) to discrete token interfaces, proving that chain learning remains effective with token-based models and interfaces.

Method: Proposes TokenChain with semantic-token ASR coupled with two-stage TTS: autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR, and masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. Uses straight-through argmax/Gumbel-Softmax for end-to-end feedback and dynamic weight averaging to balance with supervised ASR.

Result: TokenChain surpasses baseline accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier, yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by 31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: Chain learning remains effective with token interfaces and models, demonstrating that the discrete speech chain approach significantly improves both ASR and TTS performance while maintaining stability and minimizing forgetting.

Abstract: Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves
effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully
discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an
autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a
masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end
feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through
argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift, leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets for LLMs, which is problematic given their tendency to produce hallucinated outputs.

Method: Proposed Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP) that systematically reweights calibration samples based on their proximity to the test prompt.

Result: Experiments on MMLU benchmark show DS-CP delivers more reliable coverage than standard conformal prediction under substantial distribution shifts while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: DS-CP provides a practical step toward trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world deployment, especially under domain shift conditions.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse
tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications.
Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift,
often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a
new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our
framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain
shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their
proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing
adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark
demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than
standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution
shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward
trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world

TL;DR: OASIS is a segmentation-regression framework with weighted loss that prioritizes object overlap regions during training, improving intensity reconstruction and topological feature extraction from obscured objects in scientific imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms treat all regions equally, failing to prioritize overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous, which is particularly problematic for extracting pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects.

Method: OASIS uses a weighted loss function designed to prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, extending the concept of weighting overlap regions from instance segmentation to segmentation regression.

Result: OASIS improved median intensity reconstruction errors from -32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and topological intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855 compared to unweighted training.

Conclusion: OASIS provides a generalizable methodology for scientific imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures features of interest, with demonstrated ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated regions.

Abstract: The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in
scientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can
predict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather
than prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent
advances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap
in training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of
overlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We
address this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new
segmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to
prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of
pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We
demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to
directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is
induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection
chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for
reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried
within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to
unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from
-32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological
intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains
demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated
regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific
imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures
features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain
adoption.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a discretized Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron model for deep SNNs that outperforms LIF neurons while maintaining training stability through analytical surrogate gradient windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF neurons are computationally efficient but lack expressiveness due to linear dynamics, while more complex models like QIF offer richer nonlinear dynamics but suffer from training instability.

Method: First discretization of QIF neuron model for deep SNNs with analytical formulation of surrogate gradient windows derived from discretization parameters to minimize gradient mismatch.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LIF-based methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS datasets.

Conclusion: The discretized QIF neuron model is a compelling alternative to LIF neurons, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability for deep SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel regularization strategies for adversarial training: weighted adversarial mutual regularization using decomposed KL-divergence with unequal weights, and adversarial generalization regularization that incorporates clean target distribution to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adversarial training using MSE regularization enforces overly uniform optimization between output distributions, limiting robustness. The authors aim to address this limitation by adapting mutual learning concepts from knowledge distillation.

Method: Two regularization strategies: 1) Weighted adversarial mutual regularization with decomposed KL-divergence loss allowing flexible weight control between main and auxiliary objectives, 2) Adversarial generalization regularization that adds clean target distribution to the training objective.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to existing regularization-based approaches.

Conclusion: The novel regularization strategies based on mutual learning principles effectively enhance adversarial robustness by addressing the limitations of standard MSE regularization in adversarial training scenarios.

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods are computationally expensive, require large amounts of data, or are brittle to hyperparameters. The paper aims to develop an efficient and robust TTA method based on latent space geometry insights.

Method: NEO re-centers target data embeddings at the origin based on theoretical insights about latent space geometry. It's a hyperparameter-free method that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference.

Result: NEO improves ViT-Base accuracy on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to 59.2% with just one batch of 64 samples. It beats 7/7 TTA methods on ImageNet benchmarks and 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C while using the least compute. Reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% on edge devices.

Conclusion: NEO provides an efficient and effective TTA solution that works well across multiple ViT architectures and datasets, demonstrating practical utility for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph embedding methods have limitations: they require predefined neighborhood sizes which may not reveal optimal structural correlations, and linear projection methods relying on singular pattern mining lack adaptability to different scenarios.

Method: Developed Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding (NGLGE) with adaptive graph learning for neighborhoods, reconstructed low-rank representation, and ℓ₂,₀ norm constraint on projection matrix to explore additional pattern information. Includes an efficient iterative solving algorithm.

Result: Comparative evaluations on diverse datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across different scenarios.

Conclusion: NGLGE effectively addresses limitations of existing graph embedding methods by adaptively learning neighborhood structures and flexibly exploring latent patterns, demonstrating improved performance in various applications.

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

*Pafue Christy Nganjimi,Andrew Soltan,Danielle Belgrave,Lei Clifton,David A. Clifton,Anshul Thakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using smooth quadratic Bézier curves as parametric surrogates for noisy SGD trajectories in dataset condensation, improving gradient stability, convergence speed, and memory efficiency while maintaining clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dataset condensation methods use full SGD trajectories as alignment targets, but these trajectories are noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead.

Method: Replace full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates using quadratic Bézier curves that connect initial and final model states from real training trajectories, providing noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development with stabilized gradients, accelerated convergence, and eliminated dense trajectory storage.

Conclusion: Bézier-mode connections serve as effective surrogates for SGD paths in dataset condensation, providing superior performance while addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

*Paloma García-de-Herreros,Philipp Slusallek,Dietrich Klakow,Vagrant Gautam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decoder-only models underperform encoder-only models in cross-modal adaptation for PDE-based simulation tasks. Two novel methods - Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling - improve decoder-only performance by mimicking bidirectionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model architecture affects cross-modal adaptation for scientific ML tasks, particularly comparing encoder-only vs decoder-only models for time-dependent PDE simulations.

Method: Systematic ablation studies comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models, plus introducing two novel approaches: Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling to mimic bidirectionality in autoregressive models.

Result: Decoder-only models perform significantly worse than encoder-only models when using existing approaches. Scaling decoder-only models doesn't help. Both novel methods improve decoder-only performance across all tasks and adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only performance.

Conclusion: Decoder-only models can be made competitive for cross-modal adaptation in scientific ML through methods that mimic bidirectionality, broadening the spectrum of usable models for scientific applications.

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

### [195] [Gaussian Embeddings: How JEPAs Secretly Learn Your Data Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05949)
*Randall Balestriero,Nicolas Ballas,Mike Rabbat,Yann LeCun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JEPAs not only prevent representation collapse but also provably estimate data density, enabling applications like outlier detection and data curation through efficient closed-form computation using the model's Jacobian matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover that the anti-collapse term in Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) does more than prevent collapse—it actually estimates data density, revealing a previously unknown capability of these models.

Method: Theoretical analysis showing that any successfully trained JEPA can compute sample probabilities using the model's Jacobian matrix at each sample point, with empirical validation across various datasets and JEPA-family methods including I-JEPA, DINOv2, and MetaCLIP.

Result: JEPAs can be used for density estimation, outlier detection, and data curation through efficient closed-form probability computation, with successful empirical validation across synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet datasets using different JEPA-family methods.

Conclusion: The anti-collapse term in JEPAs inherently performs density estimation, enabling the development of JEPA-SCORE for extracting learned densities and expanding the utility of JEPA models beyond representation learning to probabilistic applications.

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

### [196] [Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Agent Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05442)
*Zizhao Wang,Dingcheng Li,Vaishakh Keshava,Phillip Wallis,Ananth Balashankar,Peter Stone,Lukas Rutishauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARLAS is an adversarial RL framework that co-trains attacker and defender LLMs to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and learn robust defenses, improving agent safety against indirect prompt injection attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defense strategies rely on manually crafted attack datasets, which lack diversity and leave agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. There's a need for automated generation of diverse attacks to improve agent robustness.

Method: Proposes ARLAS framework using adversarial RL formulated as a two-player zero-sum game. Co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to generate diverse prompt injections, and an agent that learns to defend while completing tasks. Uses population-based learning to train against all previous attacker checkpoints.

Result: Agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve significantly lower attack success rate than original models while also improving task success rate. The adversarial process generates diverse and challenging attacks, leading to more robust agents.

Conclusion: ARLAS effectively addresses the limitation of manual attack pattern generation by autonomously creating diverse prompt injections through adversarial RL, resulting in more robust LLM agents against indirect prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

### [197] [AMAQ: Adaptive Mixed-bit Activation Quantization for Collaborative Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05468)
*Yurun Song,Zhuoyi Yang,Ian G. Harris,Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient Split Learning with Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ) reduces communication overhead in collaborative LLM training by progressively compressing activations and gradients from high to low precision based on feature and layer importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address communication efficiency and computational overhead challenges in collaborative server-client distributed training of large language models, especially for low-resource devices.

Method: Implement Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ) that progressively compresses activations and gradients from 6-8 bits to 3-4 bits using bit regularization to allocate bit budgets across channels based on feature-wise and layer-wise importance.

Result: AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches with ~2.5% higher generation accuracy and ~1.3% better classification accuracy for LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B models, while enhancing training stability and reducing ultra-low bit representation collapse.

Conclusion: AMAQ provides a practical and effective solution for collaborative training with minimal communication cost, offering superior inference accuracy with only modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

### [198] [NorMuon: Making Muon more efficient and scalable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05491)
*Zichong Li,Liming Liu,Chen Liang,Weizhu Chen,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NorMuon is a new optimizer that combines Muon's orthogonalization benefits with neuron-level adaptive learning rates, achieving better training efficiency than both Adam and Muon while maintaining similar memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Muon's orthogonalization benefits and Adam's adaptive learning rates, addressing the imbalance in neuron norms that occurs with Muon optimization.

Method: NorMuon maintains second-order momentum statistics for each neuron and applies row-wise normalization after orthogonalization, with an efficient distributed implementation under FSDP2 framework.

Result: NorMuon outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1B parameter pretraining, with comparable memory footprint to Muon.

Conclusion: Orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning.

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

### [199] [Improving Discrete Diffusion Unmasking Policies Beyond Explicit Reference Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05725)
*Chunsan Hong,Seonho An,Min-Soo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned scheduler for masked diffusion models outperforms heuristic schedules by treating denoising as a KL-regularized MDP, achieving significant gains in text generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked diffusion models rely on rule-based schedules for unmasking positions, which are ad hoc and suboptimal. A learned scheduler could better determine the optimal unmasking order.

Method: Formulate denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process with an explicit reference policy, optimizing a regularized objective that provides policy improvement and convergence guarantees.

Result: Learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence heuristic across four benchmarks, achieving 20.1% gain over random and 11.2% gain over max-confidence on SUDOKU where unmasking order is critical.

Conclusion: Learned schedulers provide a principled alternative to heuristic schedules in masked diffusion models, generating samples that more closely match the data distribution with proven theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

*Giorgio Giannone,Guangxuan Xu,Nikhil Shivakumar Nayak,Rohan Mahesh Awhad,Shivchander Sudalairaj,Kai Xu,Akash Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF) addresses premature exploitation in Particle Filtering for mathematical reasoning by introducing Entropic Annealing to maintain diversity and Look-ahead Modulation to assess reasoning path potential, achieving up to 50% relative improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particle Filtering (PF) suffers from premature exploitation when guided by process reward models, causing it to commit to locally promising trajectories too early and prune potentially correct hypotheses, especially under constrained computational budgets.

Method: ePF integrates two techniques: Entropic Annealing (EA) monitors search diversity via entropy and dynamically anneals the resampling distribution when diversity drops; Look-ahead Modulation (LaM) adds a predictive guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors.

Result: On several challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50% relative improvement in task reward.

Conclusion: ePF improves PF's resilience by balancing exploration of diverse solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward regions, leading to higher-quality solutions in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

*Martin Benfeghoul,Teresa Delgado,Adnan Oomerjee,Haitham Bou Ammar,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Existing hybrid linear attention methods inadvertently bypass linear components, relying mainly on sliding-window softmax. Proposed solutions include inference-time hybridization, HedgeCATs with attention-weight transfer and LoRA fine-tuning, and Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout to ensure balanced component usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' quadratic complexity limits scalability. Linear attention reduces complexity but pre-training is expensive. Post-training linearisation methods exist but have a critical flaw: they bypass linear components and rely almost entirely on sliding-window softmax.

Method: Three solutions: (1) inference-time hybridization of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax, (2) HedgeCATs combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning, and (3) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout that stochastically suppresses softmax branch during training.

Result: Methods maintain computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and ensuring genuine linear attention adoption.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions restore validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions by preventing component collapse and ensuring balanced usage of linear attention components.

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

*Xueyan Li,Guinan Su,Mrinmaya Sachan,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes calibrated decoding strategies that sample tokens based on estimated correctness rather than confidence alone, resolving the conflict between exploration and accuracy in LLM reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for diverse reasoning chains either increase exploration with high temperature (sacrificing accuracy) or reject low-confidence samples (limiting exploration), creating a conflict between exploration and reliability.

Method: Proposes three strategies: Greedy-Threshold (makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps), Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon (set truncation thresholds based on estimated rank-wise correctness).

Result: The methods show gains across math and general reasoning benchmarks by better balancing exploration and accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings challenge prevailing heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and demonstrate that sampling should be calibrated by correctness rather than confidence alone.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

*Nyal Patel,Matthieu Bou,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A failure-aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method that focuses on misclassified examples to better extract latent reward functions from RLHF-aligned LLMs, improving interpretability and enabling more effective re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF aligns LLMs with human preferences but hides the underlying reward signals, creating challenges for interpretability and safety. Existing IRL methods treat all preference pairs equally and miss the most informative signals from misclassified examples.

Method: Proposes a novel failure-aware IRL algorithm that specifically focuses on examples where the extracted reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, using these failures to better recover the true latent rewards.

Result: Failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines across multiple metrics in LLM detoxification tasks, without needing external classifiers or supervision. It yields rewards that better capture true incentives learned during RLHF.

Conclusion: Failure-aware IRL provides a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and reducing ambiguity in the IRL process, enabling more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

*Matthieu Bou,Nyal Patel,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian IRL framework for auditing LLMs that addresses reward non-identifiability, provides uncertainty-aware diagnostics, and validates policy-level utility through RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' implicit objectives are dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing challenging. Existing IRL approaches either produce overconfident single estimates or fail to address fundamental ambiguity in reward inference.

Method: Leverages Bayesian IRL to recover reward distributions, quantifies non-identifiability through posterior contraction analysis, provides uncertainty-aware diagnostics for spurious shortcuts and OOD prompts, and validates utility via RLHF training.

Result: Successfully audited a detoxified LLM, yielding well-calibrated and interpretable objectives that strengthen alignment guarantees. Achieved comparable training dynamics and toxicity reductions to ground-truth alignment.

Conclusion: Provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to verify LLMs' true objectives, advancing toward more trustworthy and accountable AI systems.

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on chain-of-thought data shows small high-quality datasets outperform massive ones, but quality is ill-defined. The paper proposes using influence functions to measure CoT example impact on accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning methods rely on indirect heuristics like problem difficulty or trace length, while instruction-tuning has explored automated selection strategies but rarely in reasoning contexts. There's a need to better define what constitutes 'quality' reasoning data.

Method: Propose defining reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy. Introduce influence-based pruning method.

Result: Influence-based pruning consistently outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines on math reasoning tasks within a model family.

Conclusion: Using influence functions provides a principled approach to define and select high-quality reasoning data, offering better performance than existing methods for chain-of-thought fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

*Mingkang Zhu,Xi Chen,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stratified GRPO addresses cross-stratum bias in RL training of LLM search agents by partitioning heterogeneous trajectories into homogeneous strata and computing advantages locally within each stratum, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods using single global baselines suffer from cross-stratum bias when training LLM search agents, due to structural heterogeneity in search trajectories that leads to distorted credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex search strategies.

Method: Proposed Stratified GRPO with Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN) - partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on structural properties, computes advantages locally within each stratum, and linearly blends SAN with global estimator for practical stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show Stratified GRPO consistently outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies on diverse single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Stratification provides a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents, eliminating cross-stratum bias while maintaining global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

### [207] [Leveraging Vision Transformers for Enhanced Classification of Emotions using ECG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05826)
*Pubudu L. Indrasiri,Bipasha Kashyap,Pubudu N. Pathirana*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved Vision Transformer architecture enhanced with CNN and SE blocks for emotion recognition from ECG signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance on YAAD and DREAMER datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical signals like ECG can reveal emotional states through physiological changes, but traditional methods are limited. Advanced transformer architectures offer superior performance over conventional machine learning approaches for emotion detection from ECG data.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Advanced preprocessing using continuous wavelet transform and power spectral density to convert ECG signals into images, 2) Enhanced Vision Transformer architecture integrated with CNN and SE blocks for improved emotion classification.

Result: Outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods on both YAAD dataset (7 emotional states, valence, arousal) and DREAMER dataset (valence, arousal, dominance classification).

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-enhanced Vision Transformer architecture effectively addresses emotion recognition challenges from ECG signals and demonstrates superior performance compared to current leading techniques.

Abstract: Biomedical signals provide insights into various conditions affecting the
human body. Beyond diagnostic capabilities, these signals offer a deeper
understanding of how specific organs respond to an individual's emotions and
feelings. For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability
linked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system
activity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our
emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional
approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which
surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We begin by
assessing the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a forefront model
in image classification, for identifying emotions in imaged ECGs. Following
this, we present and evaluate an improved version of ViT, integrating both CNN
and SE blocks, aiming to bolster performance on imaged ECGs associated with
emotion detection. Our method unfolds in two critical phases: first, we apply
advanced preprocessing techniques for signal purification and converting
signals into interpretable images using continuous wavelet transform and power
spectral density analysis; second, we unveil a performance-boosted vision
transformer architecture, cleverly enhanced with convolutional neural network
components, to adeptly tackle the challenges of emotion recognition. Our
methodology's robustness and innovation were thoroughly tested using ECG data
from the YAAD and DREAMER datasets, leading to remarkable outcomes. For the
YAAD dataset, our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in
classifying seven unique emotional states, as well as in valence and arousal
classification. Similarly, in the DREAMER dataset, our method excelled in
distinguishing between valence, arousal and dominance, surpassing current
leading techniques.

### [208] [Towards Robust and Realible Multimodal Fake News Detection with Incomplete Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05839)
*Hengyang Zhou,Yiwei Wei,Jian Yang,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: MMLNet is a robust multimodal fusion strategy for fake news detection that handles modality incompleteness through multi-expert collaboration, incomplete modality adapters, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fake news detection models struggle with real-world modality incompleteness during information dissemination, which harms generalization and robustness.

Method: Three key components: Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning for missing modality compensation, Incomplete Modality Adapters for feature distribution adaptation, and Modality Missing Learning with adaptive weighting and contrastive learning.

Result: Superior performance on three real-world benchmarks across two languages compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining simplicity.

Conclusion: MMLNet effectively addresses modality incompleteness in fake news detection, improving robustness and helping curb malicious misinformation spread.

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has become an urgent task with the
emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous
studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn
discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world
applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during
dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to
the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a
novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert
Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.
It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to
compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary
information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters
compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature
distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive
weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning.
We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news
detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation,
MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.

*Christian Marinoni,Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni,Eleonora Grassucci,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A diffusion model framework for generating viewpoint-specific videos with audio from 360-degree environments using panoramic saliency, bounding-box positioning, and scene captions as conditioning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained control for generating viewpoint-specific content from immersive 360-degree environments, restricting creation of audio-visual experiences aware of off-camera events.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model with three conditioning signals: panoramic saliency map for regions of interest, bounding-box-aware signed distance map for target viewpoint, and descriptive caption of the entire scene.

Result: Generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios coherently influenced by broader environmental context, introducing strong controllability for realistic immersive audio-visual generation.

Conclusion: First framework for controllable audio-visual generation that effectively creates viewpoint-specific content from 360-degree environments with demonstrated effectiveness through audiovisual examples.

Abstract: The generation of sounding videos has seen significant advancements with the
advent of diffusion models. However, existing methods often lack the
fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger,
immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of
audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable
audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we
propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals
derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify
regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the
target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating
these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios
that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context,
introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and
immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the
effectiveness of our framework.

*Zhongyi Zhang,Julie A. Hides,Enrico De Martino,Abdul Joseph Fofanah,Gervase Tuxworth*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: nnsam2 is a few-shot segmentation framework that uses only one annotated slice per dataset to achieve expert-level segmentation of lumbar paraspinal muscles across multi-sequence MRI and multi-protocol CT, with statistical equivalence to manual measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and generalizable segmentation of lumbar paraspinal muscles across multiple imaging modalities and protocols with minimal supervision, overcoming the limitations of existing methods that require extensive manual annotation.

Method: Used single-slice SAM2 prompts to generate pseudo-labels, which were pooled across datasets and refined through three sequential, independent nnU-Net models. Evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient and statistical equivalence testing (TOST) with intraclass correlation coefficients.

Result: Achieved DSCs of 0.94-0.96 on MR and 0.92-0.93 on CT, outperforming all comparison methods. Automated measurements were statistically equivalent to expert references for muscle volume, CT attenuation, and fat ratio with ICCs of 0.86-1.00.

Conclusion: nnsam2 is a state-of-the-art few-shot framework that demonstrates high annotation efficiency, robust generalizability, and reproducibility across multimodal, multicenter cohorts, producing measurements statistically comparable to expert references.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate No-New SAM2 (nnsam2) for few-shot
segmentation of lumbar paraspinal muscles using only a single annotated slice
per dataset, and to assess its statistical comparability with expert
measurements across multi-sequence MRI and multi-protocol CT.
  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,219 scans (19,439 slices) from 762
participants across six datasets. Six slices (one per dataset) served as
labeled examples, while the remaining 19,433 slices were used for testing. In
this minimal-supervision setting, nnsam2 used single-slice SAM2 prompts to
generate pseudo-labels, which were pooled across datasets and refined through
three sequential, independent nnU-Net models. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and automated
measurements-including muscle volume, fat ratio, and CT attenuation-were
assessed with two one-sided tests (TOST) and intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC).
  Results: nnsam2 outperformed vanilla SAM2, its medical variants,
TotalSegmentator, and the leading few-shot method, achieving DSCs of 0.94-0.96
on MR images and 0.92-0.93 on CT. Automated and expert measurements were
statistically equivalent for muscle volume (MRI/CT), CT attenuation, and Dixon
fat ratio (TOST, P < 0.05), with consistently high ICCs (0.86-1.00).
  Conclusion: We developed nnsam2, a state-of-the-art few-shot framework for
multi-modality LPM segmentation, producing muscle volume (MRI/CT), attenuation
(CT), and fat ratio (Dixon MRI) measurements that were statistically comparable
to expert references. Validated across multimodal, multicenter, and
multinational cohorts, and released with open code and data, nnsam2
demonstrated high annotation efficiency, robust generalizability, and

*Naveenkumar G Venkataswamy,Yu Liu,Soumyabrata Dey,Stephanie Schuckers,Masudul H Imtiaz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A smartphone-based iris recognition system using visible spectrum imaging achieves high accuracy through ISO-compliant acquisition and lightweight neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphone iris recognition in visible spectrum is challenging due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and lack of standardized capture controls.

Method: Developed an Android app for real-time ISO-compliant image acquisition, created CUVIRIS dataset, built LightIrisNet (MobileNetV3-based segmentation) and IrisFormer (transformer matcher) for on-device processing.

Result: OSIRIS achieved 97.9% TAR at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%), IrisFormer trained on UBIRIS.v2 achieved 0.057% EER on CUVIRIS dataset.

Conclusion: Standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and practical iris recognition on smartphones.

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) remains
difficult due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and the
absence of standardized capture controls. This work presents a compact
end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at
acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on
commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time
framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset
of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based
multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient
on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the
VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against
prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%),
while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on
CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the
dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that
standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and
practical iris recognition on smartphones.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel warm-basis iterative projection method (WB-IPM) for Fluorescence Molecular Tomography that combines learning-based and iterative approaches to improve depth reconstruction accuracy with reduced training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMT faces accuracy challenges in depth reconstruction, and conventional iterative methods struggle with poor z-resolution. Supervised learning approaches require impractical large paired datasets, creating a need to effectively combine learning with iterative schemes.

Method: Proposed WB-IPM method that establishes theoretical underpinnings and uses a weaker loss function depending only on the directional component between ground truth and neural network output.

Result: Achieves significantly more accurate reconstructions than learning-based and iterative methods alone, with substantially reduced training effort.

Conclusion: The method provides more accurate and stable FMT reconstruction while reducing training requirements, as justified by error analysis and experiments on simulated and real data.

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a widely used non-invasive optical
imaging technology in biomedical research. It usually faces significant
accuracy challenges in depth reconstruction, and conventional iterative methods
struggle with poor $z$-resolution even with advanced regularization. Supervised
learning approaches can improve recovery accuracy but rely on large,
high-quality paired training dataset that is often impractical to acquire in
practice. This naturally raises the question of how learning-based approaches
can be effectively combined with iterative schemes to yield more accurate and
stable algorithms. In this work, we present a novel warm-basis iterative
projection method (WB-IPM) and establish its theoretical underpinnings. The
method is able to achieve significantly more accurate reconstructions than the
learning-based and iterative-based methods. In addition, it allows a weaker
loss function depending solely on the directional component of the difference
between ground truth and neural network output, thereby substantially reducing
the training effort. These features are justified by our error analysis as well
as simulated and real-data experiments.

### [213] [Quantum Concept Music Score from Quantum Picturalism: Musical Incarnation of a Bell-Pair under Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05391)
*Rakhat-Bi Abdyssagin,Bob Coecke*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Introduces Quantum Concept Music (QCM), a new music formalism based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics and ZX-calculus that represents musical relations diagrammatically and enables direct translation of quantum phenomena into music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a music formalism that better captures the relational and interactive nature of music, going beyond linear Western classical notation, and enabling quantum phenomena to be translated into music compositions.

Method: Based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM) and Quantum Picturalism (QPict), using diagrammatic representation to explicitly show relations within and between music composition, performance, and automation concepts.

Result: Proposed a score for musicians interacting like a Bell-pair under measurement, outlined live performance examples, and created a formalism that captures music's interactive nature across different genres.

Conclusion: QCM provides a powerful and efficient music formalism that transcends Western classical notation boundaries, enabling applications in composition, live performance, and AI music generation while capturing music's fundamental relational dimension.

Abstract: We initiate the development of a new language and theory for quantum music,
to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is
based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its
diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on
ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is
the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and
between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM
also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music
compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.
  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a
Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live
performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily
relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately
capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the
fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based
technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition,
but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new
template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.
  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is
powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in
terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of
Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different
genres and directions.

TL;DR: A GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent framework is proposed for zero-touch optical networks to handle multiple tasks across network lifecycle stages through autonomous execution and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical networks need autonomous operation and zero-touch management due to expanding scales and bandwidth, but existing single-agent GenAI systems struggle with multi-task collaboration across network layers.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical multi-agent framework with architecture, implementation, and applications demonstrated through field-deployed mesh network testing three scenarios: QoT estimation (planning), dynamic channel management (operation), and capacity increase (upgrade).

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated capabilities in multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization across different network lifecycle stages.

Conclusion: This approach provides a promising solution for intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management, paving the way for more specialized and adaptive zero-touch optical networks.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has
catalyzed a transformative technological revolution across all walks of life.
As the backbone of wideband communication, optical networks are expecting
high-level autonomous operation and zero-touch management to accommodate their
expanding network scales and escalating transmission bandwidth. The integration
of GenAI is deemed as the pivotal solution for realizing zero-touch optical
networks. However, the lifecycle management of optical networks involves a
multitude of tasks and necessitates seamless collaboration across multiple
layers, which poses significant challenges to the existing single-agent GenAI
systems. In this paper, we propose a GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent
framework designed to streamline multi-task autonomous execution for zero-touch
optical networks. We present the architecture, implementation, and applications
of this framework. A field-deployed mesh network is utilized to demonstrate
three typical scenarios throughout the lifecycle of optical network: quality of
transmission estimation in the planning stage, dynamic channel adding/dropping
in the operation stage, and system capacity increase in the upgrade stage. The
case studies, illustrate the capabilities of multi-agent framework in
multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization.
This work provides a promising approach for the future development of
intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management solutions, paving

*Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Wenbo Zhou,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SafeGuider is a two-step framework that uses embedding-level recognition and safety-aware feature erasure to defend against adversarial prompts in text-to-image models while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that bypass safety measures, creating harmful content. Current defenses struggle to balance robustness with practical utility.

Method: Empirical study of Stable Diffusion's text encoder revealed [EOS] token patterns. SafeGuider combines embedding-level recognition with safety-aware feature erasure beam search to detect and neutralize adversarial prompts.

Result: SafeGuider achieves maximum attack success rate of only 5.48% across various scenarios, generates safe images instead of refusing generation, and works across models like Stable Diffusion and Flux.

Conclusion: SafeGuider provides robust safety control without compromising image quality, demonstrating practical utility for secure text-to-image system deployment across different architectures.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures
and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving
robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world
applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first
conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD)
model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our
findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting
distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its
embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{SafeGuider}, a
two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising
generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model
with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration
enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign
prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain
attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack
success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack
scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images
for unsafe prompts, \textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images,
enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the
SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as
the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different
architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical
deployment of secure text-to-image systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A principled framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks, addressing unfair comparisons and uncertainty quantification through Bayesian hierarchical modeling and embedding-space clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM vulnerability evaluations are untrustworthy due to unfair model comparisons, heuristic inputs, and metrics that fail to capture uncertainty in non-deterministic LLM outputs.

Method: Proposes practical experimental design for fair LLM comparisons in training and deployment scenarios, and a Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering for improved uncertainty quantification.

Result: The framework shows that considering output variability leads to less definitive findings, but reveals increased vulnerabilities in Transformer and Mamba architectures for certain attacks across LLMs with similar training data or mathematical ability.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework provides more reliable evaluation of LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks by addressing experimental design fairness and uncertainty quantification challenges.

Abstract: Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical
to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult
to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully
comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to
capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and
practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental
design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner
scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second,
we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical
model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve
uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not
deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only
have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the
improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection
attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security
of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration
of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some
attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant
vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical
ability.

TL;DR: StereoSync is a novel model for video-aligned audio generation that achieves both temporal synchronization and spatial alignment with visual context using depth maps and bounding boxes as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-aligned audio generation remains relatively unexplored compared to general audio generation, with existing methods primarily focusing only on temporal synchronization while lacking spatial awareness.

Method: Leverages pretrained foundation models and extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model.

Result: Experimental evaluation on the Walking The Maps dataset demonstrates StereoSync's ability to achieve both temporal and spatial alignment, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to video scene structure and movement.

Conclusion: StereoSync advances state of the art in video-to-audio generation by incorporating spatial awareness, resulting in significantly more immersive and realistic audio experiences while maintaining efficiency through pretrained models.

Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years,
video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier.
To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model
designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a
reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover,
StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models,
reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality
synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal
synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by
incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed,
given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and
bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based
audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple
synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial
structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The
Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature
animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial
alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and
resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.

Motivation: To improve semantic alignment between generated audio and video content by leveraging aligned multimodal encoders for precise semantic control in video-to-audio generation.

Method: Uses GRAM to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, then employs a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes.

Result: Evaluation on Greatest Hits dataset shows enhanced semantic alignment between generated audio and video content, advancing state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.

Conclusion: GRAM-based alignment of multimodal encoders effectively improves semantic control and alignment in video-to-audio generation, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio
generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned
multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio
generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure
(GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling
precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of
FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on

and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate
FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio language models excel in sound recognition but are limited by single-channel input for spatial understanding, creating a need for models that can perceive acoustic scenes with spatial awareness.

Method: Uses dual spatial and spectral encoders trained on over 4,000 hours of synthetic first-order Ambisonics recordings with metadata. The model can enumerate and describe up to four directional sound sources plus background sounds and room characteristics in one pass.

Result: Evaluated with permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content, location, timing, loudness, and reverberation. Shows robustness across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and challenging mixtures. Generalizes to real room impulse responses with minor performance degradation.

Conclusion: Establishes the first audio LLM capable of full spatial-scene description with strong potential for real-world deployment, addressing the fundamental limitation of single-channel audio models in spatial understanding.

Abstract: Acoustic scene perception involves describing the type of sounds, their
timing, their direction and distance, as well as their loudness and
reverberation. While audio language models excel in sound recognition,
single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work
presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and
spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources
and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic
first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and
describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside
non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the
model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content,
location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness
across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and
challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources.
Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor
performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM
capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world
deployment. Demo: https://sci-phi-audio.github.io/demo
