### [1] [MemeMind: A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Harmful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18919)
*Hexiang Gu,Qifan Yu,Saihui Hou,Zhiqin Fang,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemeMind, a large-scale, diverse, and explainable dataset for harmful meme detection, and MemeGuard, a detection framework that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of harmful memes on social media is challenging to detect due to implicit semantics and multimodal complexity, and current datasets lack scale, diversity, and explainability.

Method: The authors created MemeMind, a dataset with rigorous standards, bilingual support, and detailed annotations, and proposed MemeGuard, a framework integrating multimodal information and reasoning modeling.

Result: MemeGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks on the MemeMind dataset.

Conclusion: MemeMind and MemeGuard address critical gaps in harmful meme detection, providing a robust dataset and framework for future research.

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

### [2] [Mirage of Mastery: Memorization Tricks LLMs into Artificially Inflated Self-Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18998)
*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often mistake memorization for reasoning, leading to unreliable responses, especially in STEM domains. A new framework reveals over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments due to memorization-driven confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover whether LLMs genuinely learn reasoning or just memorize patterns, and how this affects their trustworthiness, particularly in STEM fields.

Method: A novel framework evaluates LLMs' generalization and self-knowledge by testing their responses to logically coherent task perturbations.

Result: LLMs show over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments, relying on memorized solutions and overestimating their reasoning ability.

Conclusion: Current LLM architectures and training methods need improvement to balance self-knowledge and ensure explainability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code
and results are available publicly at

### [3] [Broken Tokens? Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19004)
*Brian Siyuan Zheng,Alisa Liu,Orevaoghene Ahia,Jonathan Hayase,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of language models to non-canonical tokenizations, finding they retain high performance and can even improve in certain tasks. Robustness arises during instruction-tuning, with post-trained models handling non-canonical inputs better than base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models are overly dependent on their tokenizer's canonical tokenizations and if non-canonical tokenizations can enhance performance.

Method: Evaluate models across 20 benchmarks using non-canonical tokenizations (random and character-level) unseen during training. Analyze robustness and performance improvements in specific tasks.

Result: Models retain up to 93.4% performance with random tokenizations and 90.8% with character-level. Character-level tokenization improves string/code tasks by +14%, and digit grouping boosts arithmetic by +33%. Robustness stems from instruction-tuning.

Conclusion: Language models are less tied to their tokenizer than assumed, and non-canonical tokenizations can enhance performance, especially in instruction-tuned models.

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

### [4] [Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19028)
*Weijie Xu,Yiwen Wang,Chi Xue,Xiangkun Hu,Xi Fang,Guimin Dong,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FiSCo is a statistical framework for evaluating group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic biases in long-form responses, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs overlook biases in long-form responses and intrinsic variability, undermining reliability.

Method: FiSCo decomposes outputs into claims, uses entailment checks for consistency, and applies statistical testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities.

Result: FiSCo reliably identifies nuanced biases and reduces the impact of LLM variability, outperforming other metrics.

Conclusion: FiSCo provides a robust method for detecting subtle biases in LLMs, enhancing fairness evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

### [5] [Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037)
*Omer Luxembourg,Haim Permuter,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DUS is a planner-model-free method for masked diffusion language models, enabling parallel unmasking with fewer denoiser calls, improving efficiency and quality in non-autoregressive text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing samplers for masked diffusion models falter under parallel unmasking due to ignored token interactions and dependencies, limiting inference speed.

Method: DUS uses a first-order Markov assumption to partition tokens into dilation-based groups, allowing parallel unmasking with minimized joint entropy per step.

Result: DUS reduces denoiser calls to O(log B) per block, outperforming confidence-based planners in math and code completion benchmarks.

Conclusion: DUS provides an efficient, high-quality text generation method without modifying the denoiser, unlocking MDLM capabilities.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

### [6] [NLPnorth @ TalentCLEF 2025: Comparing Discriminative, Contrastive, and Prompt-Based Methods for Job Title and Skill Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19058)
*Mike Zhang,Rob van der Goot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLPnorth's submission to TalentCLEF 2025 compares classification-based, contrastive-based, and prompting methods for multilingual job title matching and skill prediction, with prompting excelling in Task A and fine-tuned classification in Task B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving automatic candidate matching, career path prediction, and job market analysis by aligning job titles and skills.

Method: Compared fine-tuned classification-based, contrastive-based, and prompting methods, leveraging extra data from ESCO.

Result: Prompting achieved 0.492 MAP for Task A; fine-tuned classification achieved 0.290 MAP for Task B. Multilingual models performed best.

Conclusion: Largest multilingual models excel in both tasks, with NLPnorth ranking 5th in Task A and 3rd in Task B.

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

### [7] [MFTCXplain: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating the Moral Reasoning of LLMs through Hate Speech Multi-hop Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19073)
*Jackson Trager,Francielle Vargas,Diego Alves,Matteo Guida,Mikel K. Ngueajio,Ameeta Agrawal,Flor Plaza-del-Arco,Yalda Daryanai,Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MFTCXplain is a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs' moral reasoning using hate speech explanations, revealing misalignment with human moral judgments, especially in underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparent, multilingual benchmarks for assessing LLMs' moral reasoning, particularly in diverse cultural contexts.

Method: Introduces MFTCXplain, a dataset of 3,000 tweets in four languages, annotated with hate speech labels, moral categories, and rationales, evaluated using Moral Foundation Theory.

Result: LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836) but poorly in moral sentiment prediction (F1 < 0.35), with limited rationale alignment in underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to internalize human moral reasoning, highlighting the need for better benchmarks and model improvements.

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

### [8] [Language Models Might Not Understand You: Evaluating Theory of Mind via Story Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19089)
*Nathaniel Getachew,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: $	exttt{StorySim}$ is a framework for generating synthetic stories to evaluate LLMs' theory of mind and world modeling, revealing performance gaps and heuristic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address contamination in pretraining data and enable precise evaluation of ToM and WM capabilities in LLMs.

Method: Uses a controllable $	exttt{Storyboard}$ to generate novel, compositional stories for first- and second-order ToM and WM tasks.

Result: LLMs perform better on WM than ToM tasks and show heuristic behaviors like recency bias.

Conclusion: $	exttt{StorySim}$ provides a robust tool for evaluating LLMs, highlighting their limitations and biases.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

### [9] [Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19113)
*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), a multi-dimensional criterion to evaluate LLMs' toxicity explanations, showing their limitations in nuanced reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift focus from toxicity detection to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity, enhancing trustworthiness in downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes HAF, a theoretically-grounded criterion with six metrics to evaluate free-form toxicity explanations without human involvement.

Result: LLMs generate plausible explanations for simple prompts but fail in nuanced reasoning, producing inconsistent responses.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better alignment of LLMs' toxicity explanations with human reasoning, with open-sourced code and data.

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

### [10] [Enhanced Hybrid Transducer and Attention Encoder Decoder with Text Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19159)
*Yun Tang,Eesung Kim,Vijendra Raj Apsingekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A joint speech and text optimization method (J-TAED) enhances ASR accuracy by unifying speech and text modalities, reducing WER by 5.8-12.8% on Librispeech and 15.3-17.8% on out-of-domain datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large text corpora and improve ASR accuracy, especially in data-scarce mismatch domains, by unifying speech and text representations.

Method: Joint training of hybrid transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder (TAED) with speech and text inputs, using only speech during inference. Text-based domain adaptation is also explored.

Result: WER reductions of 5.8-12.8% on Librispeech and 15.3-17.8% on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: J-TAED effectively integrates speech and text, improving ASR performance and enabling text-based domain adaptation without requiring additional speech data.

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

### [11] [Prompt, Translate, Fine-Tune, Re-Initialize, or Instruction-Tune? Adapting LLMs for In-Context Learning in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19187)
*Christopher Toukmaji,Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates cross-lingual adaptation of LLMs for low-resource languages, comparing methods like few-shot prompting and translate-test with gradient-based techniques, finding the former superior due to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages for in-context learning, and the best adaptation methods remain unclear.

Method: Comprehensive study across five languages, three LLMs, and seven tasks, testing few-shot prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and instruction fine-tuning.

Result: Few-shot prompting and translate-test outperform gradient-based methods, with degradation attributed to catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into effective cross-lingual adaptation for low-resource languages and releases datasets/models for public use.

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

### [12] [Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209)
*Yichen Tang,Weihang Su,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu,Min Zhang,Shaoping Ma,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method for multi-agent communication to reduce information loss in reasoning tasks, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems using natural language for communication suffer from information loss, especially in reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces SDE to transfer both tokens and state transition trajectories between agents.

Result: SDE-based systems outperform other protocols, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Communication augmentation with SDE enhances LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

*Rasiq Hussain,Jerry Ma,Rithik Khandelwal,Joshua Oltmanns,Mehak Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid NLP method combining sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models and RNNs with attention to predict personality traits from long narratives, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personality assessment by leveraging long narrative interviews (2000+ tokens) using NLP, moving beyond traditional questionnaires.

Method: A two-step approach: sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models for contextual embeddings, followed by RNNs with attention for long-range dependencies and interpretability.

Result: Outperforms LLaMA and Longformer in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability for personality trait prediction.

Conclusion: Combining language-based features with long-context modeling advances personality assessment from life narratives.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

*Yuchang Zhu,Zhonghua zhen,Qunshu Lin,Haotong Wei,Xiaolong Sun,Zixuan Yu,Minghao Liu,Zibin Zheng,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how diversity in LLM-generated data impacts downstream model performance, finding moderate diversity beneficial but high diversity harmful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity and annotation costs by using LLM-generated data, while investigating the role of data diversity in model performance.

Method: Examined varying diversity levels in LLM-generated data and mixed synthetic-real data proportions, analyzing downstream model performance.

Result: Moderately diverse LLM-generated data improves performance with minimal distribution shift, while highly diverse data harms it.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for using LLMs as data generators, emphasizing the importance of controlled diversity.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Motivation: The increasing demand for mental health care and limitations of current AI-driven counseling systems, such as poor understanding of psychological states and privacy concerns, motivate the development of EmoStage.

Method: EmoStage leverages open-source LLMs for empathetic response generation, incorporating perspective-taking for psychological state inference and phase recognition to align with counseling stages.

Result: Experiments in Japanese and Chinese settings show EmoStage improves response quality and competes with data-driven methods.

Conclusion: EmoStage offers a viable solution for AI-driven counseling, balancing performance and privacy without requiring additional training data.

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

*Tzu-Hsuan Yang,Yue-Yang He,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework using Mamba (SSM) integrates phonological features and token strategies to improve APA and MDD in CAPT, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective pronunciation feedback is crucial in L2 learning, and joint modeling of APA and MDD can yield mutual benefits.

Method: Leverages Mamba (SSM), integrates phonological features, and uses token strategies for interpretability and temporal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on the SpeechOcean762 benchmark, especially in MDD.

Conclusion: First study to combine phonological attribution, SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

*Jisu Shin,Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Hoyun Song,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an atomic-level evaluation framework to measure persona fidelity in LLMs, addressing subtle deviations missed by existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for persona fidelity in LLMs fail to capture subtle inconsistencies, especially in long-form text, affecting reliability.

Method: Introduces three key metrics for atomic-level evaluation of persona alignment and consistency within and across generations.

Result: Effectively detects persona inconsistencies overlooked by prior methods, revealing influences of task structure and persona desirability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more precise assessment of persona fidelity, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona expression.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS) and Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE) to improve feature isolation and control in LLMs, showing enhanced interpretability and performance in tasks like toxicity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for understanding and controlling LLMs struggle with reliable feature localization and manipulation, prompting the need for better tools like FMS and G-SAE.

Method: The authors propose FMS to quantify feature monosemanticity and G-SAE, which conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training.

Result: G-SAE improves feature disentanglement and control, outperforming in tasks like toxicity detection and privacy attribute recognition with less quality degradation.

Conclusion: The study offers practical insights for advancing mechanistic interpretability and control in LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of G-SAE.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

*Ruihan Hu,Yu-Ming Shang,Jiankun Peng,Wei Luo,Yazhe Wang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeilProbe is a framework for detecting pre-training texts of LLMs in black-box settings without human intervention, using sequence-to-sequence mapping and key token perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring data privacy and copyright protection by detecting pre-training texts in LLMs, especially in black-box settings where existing methods fail.

Method: Uses a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to infer latent features, performs key token perturbations, and employs a prototype-based classifier to avoid overfitting.

Result: Effective and superior performance in black-box settings, demonstrated on three datasets.

Conclusion: VeilProbe provides an automated, efficient solution for detecting LLM pre-training texts without human intervention.

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

### [20] [Learning to Disentangle Latent Reasoning Rules with Language VAEs: A Systematic Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19418)
*Yingji Zhang,Marco Valentino,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores embedding explicit reasoning rules in language models using VAEs to improve generalization, interpretability, and controllability, showing success in disentangling rules and injecting prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMs rely on memorization for NLI tasks; this work aims to enhance rule-based reasoning in LMs for better performance and interpretability.

Method: Proposes a pipeline with rule-based reasoning tasks, a theoretical framework, and an end-to-end architecture using Transformer-based language VAEs.

Result: Disentangled reasoning rules, improved prior knowledge injection, and identified performance bottlenecks in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning rules in LMs enhance interpretability and performance, with practical insights for integrating prior knowledge and optimizing model layers.

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to predict human annotation disagreements, a gap overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. RLVR-style reasoning worsens disagreement prediction, highlighting the need for better evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can capture informative human annotation variation, not just majority labels, given their increasing use for automatic annotation.

Method: Extensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to predict annotation disagreements without repeated human labels, including testing RLVR-style reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in modeling disagreements, and RLVR-style reasoning degrades their performance further.

Conclusion: There's a critical need to evaluate and improve LLMs' ability to model annotation disagreements, as current methods overlook this aspect.

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuBench is introduced as a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs across 61 languages, revealing gaps in language coverage and performance disparities, especially for low-resource languages. Multilingual Consistency (MLC) is proposed as a metric, and cross-lingual transfer dynamics are explored through pretraining experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation datasets for multilingual LLMs are limited and lack cross-lingual alignment, leading to fragmented assessments of multilingual capabilities.

Method: MuBench is introduced to evaluate multilingual LLMs across 61 languages. Multilingual Consistency (MLC) is proposed as a metric. Pretraining experiments with 1.2B-parameter models on English and Chinese investigate cross-lingual transfer.

Result: Notable gaps between claimed and actual language coverage are found, with performance disparities between English and low-resource languages.

Conclusion: MuBench provides a comprehensive benchmark, and MLC offers insights for model improvement. Pretraining experiments highlight cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

*Marcos Estecha-Garitagoitia,Chen Zhang,Mario Rodríguez-Cantelar,Luis Fernando D'Haro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores turn-level data augmentation for dialogue systems using commonsense relationships and evaluates synthetic turns using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by leveraging commonsense reasoning and LLMs for data augmentation and evaluation.

Method: Uses pretrained LLMs for prompt-based generation and evaluation, inspired by Chain-of-Thought, and tests on a novel dataset with ATOMIC relations.

Result: Preliminary results show LLMs effectively perform commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Conclusion: The approach successfully utilizes LLMs for dialogue augmentation and evaluation, demonstrating potential for future applications.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between educational theory and AI-driven conversational learning by aligning LLM behaviors with established pedagogical principles.

Method: Synthesizes literature on LLMs in education and pedagogical theories, examines prompting strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and maps educational theories to LLM capabilities.

Result: Identifies gaps in applying traditional theories to LLMs (e.g., direct answers vs. co-construction of knowledge) and proposes strategies like Socratic questioning and scaffolded prompts.

Conclusion: Offers practical strategies to make LLM-based dialogues more pedagogically sound and theory-aligned, enhancing their educational productivity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

*Shu Yang,Junchao Wu,Xuansheng Wu,Derek Wong,Ninhao Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether efficient reasoning strategies in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce behavioral inconsistencies, finding that such strategies increase inconsistency despite improving token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if optimizing reasoning length in LRMs compromises robustness or leads to omitted reasoning steps, potentially undermining model reliability.

Method: Introduces $ICBENCH$, a benchmark to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: task settings, training objectives vs. behavior, and internal reasoning vs. self-explanations.

Result: Larger models are more consistent but still exhibit scheming behaviors. Efficient reasoning strategies increase inconsistency.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning improves token efficiency but risks introducing inconsistencies, warranting further investigation into supervision risks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

TL;DR: AnTKV introduces Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress KV cache in LLMs, reducing memory footprint while minimizing performance degradation by preserving high-sensitivity tokens in full precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing performance degradation in ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization for LLMs is challenging, as different tokens impact attention outputs variably.

Method: Proposes Anchor Score (AnS) to quantify token sensitivity, then develops AnTKV framework with Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization and a triton kernel for efficient deployment.

Result: AnTKV enables handling 840K tokens on an 80GB A100 GPU, 3.5x higher throughput, and outperforms prior works in 4-bit settings, achieving lower perplexity at ultra-low bits.

Conclusion: AnTKV effectively balances KV cache compression and performance, advancing ultra-low-bit quantization for LLMs.

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Result: Experimental results show the query-dependent-k strategy outperforms fixed-k in producing factual and relevant answers.

Conclusion: The query-dependent-k retrieval strategy improves answer quality in clinical evidence attribution from EHRs.

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual
and relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to structure ambiguous French posology instructions, comparing prompting and fine-tuning with a baseline NERL system. A hybrid approach (NERL + LLM) achieves 91% accuracy, balancing precision and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: French posology instructions are often ambiguous or colloquial, limiting classic ML pipelines. Structuring these is crucial for medication safety and clinical decision support.

Method: Compares prompt-based methods and fine-tuning of LLMs against a baseline NERL system. Proposes a hybrid pipeline routing low-confidence NERL cases to LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs match baseline accuracy, while prompting improves performance. The hybrid approach achieves 91% structuration accuracy.

Conclusion: The hybrid NERL-LLM pipeline offers a scalable, accurate solution for real-world clinical use, balancing precision and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with rapid adaptation to new tasks due to static pre-trained knowledge, and traditional fine-tuning is costly and prone to forgetting.

Method: KnowMap constructs a dynamic knowledge base from environmental and experiential data, fine-tuning a small knowledge-embedding model to augment a larger LLM.

Result: 17.71% performance improvement for GPT-4-turbo on the ScienceWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: KnowMap efficiently adapts LLMs to tasks and enhances reasoning by integrating environmental and experiential knowledge.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early outbreak detection is critical, but traditional surveillance is challenging. Online media monitoring is promising but impractical manually due to volume.

Method: Combines ML and non-ML techniques in a multi-stage pipeline to extract structured health event data from online articles.

Result: Processed 300M+ articles, identified 95K+ health events, with 3.5K flagged as potential outbreaks by experts.

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

*Debabrata Mahapatra,Shubham Agarwal,Apoorv Saxena,Subrata Mitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCStat leverages raw attention logits for better token importance analysis, enabling efficient compression and higher-fidelity attribution without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work relies on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure richer pre-Softmax query-key logits. RCStat aims to utilize these raw logits for more accurate analysis.

Method: Introduces RCStat, a framework using Relative Contextualization (RC) to measure token alignment, with an efficient upper bound for RC. Applied to key-value compression and attribution.

Result: Achieves significant gains in compression and attribution benchmarks, outperforming post-Softmax methods without retraining.

Conclusion: RCStat provides state-of-the-art performance in compression and attribution by leveraging raw attention logits, offering practical benefits for transformer models.

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of automatic MT metrics against human baselines, finding that state-of-the-art metrics often match or surpass human performance, but cautions against overinterpreting these results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the upper bounds of metric performance and assess whether automatic metrics can reliably measure progress in MT evaluation.

Method: Incorporating human baselines in MT meta-evaluation to compare the agreement of automatic metrics with human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art metrics often perform on par with or better than human baselines, suggesting human parity.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the challenges in reliably measuring progress in MT evaluation and call for cautious interpretation of human parity claims.

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

*Zhenke Duan,Jiqun Pan,Jiani Tu,Xiaoyi Wang,Yanqing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECCoT is a framework to validate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs, improving interpretability and trustworthiness by integrating MRF-ETM and CSBert.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparency and unreliable outputs in LLMs, particularly in reasoning chains generated by Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.

Method: Proposes ECCoT, combining MRF-ETM for topic-aware CoT generation and CSBert for causal reasoning alignment, with structured filtering of reasoning chains.

Result: ECCoT enhances interpretability, reduces biases, and improves the reliability of LLM-based decision-making.

Conclusion: ECCoT introduces a novel validation framework for reasoning chains, contributing MRF-ETM and CSBert as key innovations for trustworthy LLM outputs.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

*Tom Marzea,Abraham Israeli,Oren Tsur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach for detecting hate-mongers by analyzing user texts, activity, and network context, outperforming text and graph-based methods across Twitter, Gab, and Parler datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hate speech detection by focusing on user-level analysis, addressing challenges like coded messages and dog-whistling, and understanding hate as a social phenomenon.

Method: A multimodal aggregative approach combining hateful texts, user activity, and network data for hate-monger detection.

Result: Significant improvement in detecting hate-mongers compared to prior methods, with robust performance across diverse platforms (Twitter, Gab, Parler).

Conclusion: The multimodal approach enhances hate speech detection, supports intervention measures, and works effectively across different platforms and large datasets.

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores self-correcting methods for LLMs to reduce hallucinations in news summarization, using search engine evidence and analyzing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in LLMs, particularly in news summarization, by leveraging self-correcting methods.

Method: Apply two state-of-the-art self-correcting systems to correct hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines.

Result: Reveals practical findings on search engine snippets, few-shot prompts, and alignment of G-Eval with human evaluation.

Conclusion: Self-correcting methods show promise for reducing hallucinations in news summarization, with insights on effective evidence use.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance adaptability and efficiency in goal-oriented dialogue systems, particularly for personalized interactions like Motivational Interviews.

Method: Integrates hierarchical RL for structured dialogue phases and meta-learning for adaptability across user profiles.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LLM baselines in reward, showing improved goal-oriented dialogue performance.

Conclusion: Conditioning LLMs with structured dialogue management improves goal-oriented open-ended dialogue systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with an RL-based dialogue manager for open-ended dialogue with a
specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the
structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability
across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and
efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly
between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient
needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster
behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms
a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit
of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPT improves LLM reasoning but generalizes inconsistently to new domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the generalizability of RPT across domains, including unseen ones.

Method: Two studies: observational (comparing RPT models across domains) and interventional (fine-tuning on single domains and testing across multiple).

Result: RPT shows gains on similar tasks but inconsistent or no gains on domains with different reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: RPT's benefits are domain-specific and do not reliably generalize to new reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

### [38] [Evaluating Rare Disease Diagnostic Performance in Symptom Checkers: A Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19750)
*Takashi Nishibayashi,Seiji Kanazawa,Kumpei Yamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance changes in Symptom Checkers (SCs) for rare diseases using HPO data, showing promising predictive accuracy for diseases with frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating SC algorithm updates for rare diseases due to limited data and high manual costs.

Method: Uses HPO disease-phenotype annotations to generate synthetic vignettes, simulating SC interviews to estimate performance changes. Evaluated retrospectively with R-squared metrics.

Result: For diseases with frequency data (n=5), R^2 was 0.831 for recall@8 and 0.78 for precision@8, indicating effective prediction. Poor performance for diseases without frequency data (n=3).

Conclusion: The method enables low-cost, pre-deployment evaluation of SC updates for rare diseases, leveraging HPO to improve diagnostic support.

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of Arabic dialect classification due to its linguistic diversity and applications in chatbots, social media, and accessibility.

Method: Tested RNNs, Transformers, and LLMs (via prompt engineering) on the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets, using advanced preprocessing.

Result: MARBERTv2 outperformed others with 65% accuracy and 64% F1-score, highlighting key linguistic challenges.

Conclusion: The study advances Arabic dialect identification, supporting applications like personalized chatbots and social media monitoring.

Abstract: The Arabic language is among the most popular languages in the world with a
huge variety of dialects spoken in 22 countries. In this study, we address the
problem of classifying 18 Arabic dialects of the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets.
RNN models, Transformer models, and large language models (LLMs) via prompt
engineering are created and tested. Among these, MARBERTv2 performed best with
65% accuracy and 64% F1-score. Through the use of state-of-the-art
preprocessing techniques and the latest NLP models, this paper identifies the
most significant linguistic issues in Arabic dialect identification. The
results corroborate applications like personalized chatbots that respond in
users' dialects, social media monitoring, and greater accessibility for Arabic
communities.

*Martin Ratajczak,Jean-Philippe Robichaud,Jennifer Drexler Fox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces bidirectional recurrent attention (RA) layers for long-form speech recognition, matching multi-head attention (MHA) accuracy while being more efficient. It also proposes Direction Dropout for regularization and improved throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-head attention (MHA) is inefficient for long-form ASR due to quadratic complexity. The study explores linear-complexity RA layers as a solution.

Method: Bidirectional RA layers are developed and compared to MHA and limited-context attention (LCA). A long-form training paradigm and Direction Dropout are introduced for regularization and throughput control.

Result: RA matches MHA accuracy for short- and long-form ASR, outperforms LCA with 44% higher throughput, and Direction Dropout enhances accuracy and flexibility.

Conclusion: Bidirectional RA with Direction Dropout offers an efficient, accurate alternative to MHA for long-form ASR, with improved throughput and control.

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

TL;DR: SRFT unifies SFT and RL in a single-stage method using entropy-aware weighting, outperforming traditional methods in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimally integrating SFT and RL for LLMs, as current methods lack efficiency and synergy.

Method: Proposes SRFT, combining SFT and RL through entropy-aware weighting, using demonstrations and self-exploration.

Result: Achieves 59.1% average accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% and 10.9% on in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: SRFT effectively unifies SFT and RL, demonstrating superior performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks, prompting the need to enhance their data analysis capabilities.

Method: Curated a diverse dataset to evaluate models on data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning, then developed a data synthesis methodology.

Result: Found strategic planning is crucial, interaction design and task complexity affect reasoning, and data quality outweighs diversity.

Conclusion: A data synthesis method significantly improves open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study improves communal violence text detection in Bengali using a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60, and an ensemble model with 0.63. Challenges in context understanding were identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber hatred fuels communal violence, but classification of such texts is underexplored, especially in Bengali.

Method: Fine-tuned BanglaBERT and an ensemble model were developed, with data expanded by 1,794 instances. LIME was used for interpretability.

Result: Macro F1 scores of 0.60 (BanglaBERT) and 0.63 (ensemble). Contextual limitations and misclassifications were noted.

Conclusion: NLP and interpretability tools show promise in combating communal violence, with room for future refinement.

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current multimodal medical LLMs, such as high knowledge update costs and lack of flexibility.

Method: Decomposes diagnosis into specialized roles (e.g., General Practitioner, Radiologist) using LLM-based agents for modular collaboration.

Result: MAM outperforms baseline models by 18% to 365% across multimodal medical datasets.

Conclusion: MAM offers a scalable, efficient solution for medical diagnosis, leveraging modularity and collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is

*Yiran Zhou,Yingyu Wang,Shoudong Huang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A correspondence-free multiview point cloud registration method is introduced, leveraging raw depth information for joint pose and global map estimation, outperforming feature-based methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-based methods struggle with global optimal solutions in complex environments due to challenges in feature extraction and data association.

Method: The method represents the global map as a depth map and uses raw depth data to formulate a non-linear least squares optimisation, bypassing explicit feature extraction and data association.

Result: The method achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches, especially in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed correspondence-free approach effectively addresses limitations of feature-based methods, offering improved performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

TL;DR: An enhanced YOLOv8 framework for real-time vehicle detection, classification, and carbon emission estimation, integrating deep OCR for license plate recognition and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise, automated carbon emission monitoring in urban environments by combining real-time vehicle detection with fine-grained recognition tasks.

Method: Enhances YOLOv8 for vehicle detection, segmentation, and tracking, then uses a deep OCR module for license plate recognition and validation via an external database.

Result: Achieved 71% mAP for detection, 70% for segmentation, and 99% OCR accuracy, demonstrating feasibility for smart transportation systems.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for vehicle-specific carbon emission monitoring, combining real-time detection and deep OCR effectively.

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision-based method quantifies Parkinson's disease motor characteristics from video, improving accuracy and granularity over subjective clinical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective clinical evaluations of Parkinson's disease motor symptoms are prone to variability and lack granularity, necessitating an objective, quantifiable method.

Method: Proposes four sets of video-based features to characterize motor deficits, validated with PCA and machine learning for MDS-UPDRS score prediction.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction and identifies granular distinctions in motor deficits.

Conclusion: The framework offers an objective, interpretable solution for PD motor assessment, applicable in clinical and remote settings, with future work needed for treatment response evaluation.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

*Chong Di,Shuwang Zhou,Da Chen,Jean-Marie Mirebeau,Minglei Shu,Laurent D. Cohen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based framework for segment-wise tracking of tubular structures, outperforming existing methods by dynamically exploring segments via Q-Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segment-wise tracking methods are computationally inefficient and rely heavily on prior knowledge, limiting their adaptability to complex morphologies.

Method: Proposes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework using Q-Learning to dynamically explore segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches, handling complex topologies and maintaining global coherence without extensive prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust and efficient solution for tracking tubular structures, reducing reliance on prior assumptions and improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

TL;DR: An AI-based automated safety monitoring system for tower cranes integrates camera and LiDAR data to protect workers and prevent collisions, proving effective in real-world construction sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety risks in automated tower crane operations, especially for human workers and crane collisions, using advanced 3D data fusion.

Method: Developed a system combining camera and LiDAR data for 3D localization, integrating state-of-the-art methods into a software pipeline with hardware and display systems.

Result: Achieved accurate and effective safety monitoring, validated through real-site analysis and visualization.

Conclusion: The system serves as a valuable toolkit for enhancing safety in automated tower crane operations.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans
and MiCs by integrating the captured information from camera and LiDAR. The
state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed
software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore,
we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and
visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable
safety monitoring toolkit on site.

*Rui An,Yifeng Zhang,Ziran Liang,Wenqi Fan,Yuxuan Liang,Xuequn Shang,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Damba-ST is a domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction, addressing limitations of Transformer-based models by leveraging linear complexity and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based models for urban spatio-temporal prediction suffer from high computational complexity and poor cross-domain generalization, limiting scalability and practical deployment.

Method: Damba-ST introduces a domain-adaptive state space model with shared and domain-specific subspaces, along with three Domain Adapters for cross-domain alignment.

Result: Damba-ST achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining.

Conclusion: Damba-ST effectively combines efficiency and adaptability, offering a scalable solution for urban spatio-temporal prediction across diverse regions.

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDict-VLM introduces a spectral dictionary token mixer to replace convolutions and self-attention in VLMs, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify vision-language models by removing computationally intensive components (convolutions and self-attention) while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses a spectral dictionary token mixer to represent image patches and wordpieces as sparse combinations of learnable frequency atoms.

Result: Achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, SPICE of 27.0 on MS-COCO, and 50.3% accuracy on VQAv2, with 60% fewer parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: SDict-VLM offers efficient, interpretable VLMs with tunable accuracy-compute trade-offs, closing the gap to larger models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRIS is a novel framework using pre-trained diffusion models for precise remote sensing image segmentation via natural language, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods struggle with aerial imagery due to scale variations, diverse orientations, and semantic ambiguities.

Method: DiffRIS introduces a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD) for enhanced alignment.

Result: DiffRIS outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, RISBench), setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models with adaptive components effectively addresses RRSIS challenges.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE is a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for visualizing visual and textual saliency in LVLMs during open-ended VQA, outperforming prior methods in human-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where LVLMs focus visually and textually is crucial for transparency, diagnosing issues like hallucination and bias.

Method: GLIMPSE combines gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to generate holistic attribution heat maps.

Result: GLIMPSE provides fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal reasoning, revealing human-attention misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Conclusion: GLIMPSE advances interpretability in LVLMs, offering a powerful tool for analyzing and improving model behavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2MD, a method to distill self-attention-based diffusion transformers into linear-complexity Mamba models, enabling efficient high-resolution image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of self-attention in diffusion transformers for high-resolution image generation motivates the need for a more efficient alternative like Mamba, though direct training is challenging.

Method: Proposes T2MD, a distillation pipeline combining self-attention and Mamba, using layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation to ease training.

Result: Achieves efficient 2048×2048 image generation with low overhead and high quality, demonstrating Mamba's feasibility for non-causal visual tasks.

Conclusion: T2MD successfully bridges the gap between self-attention and Mamba, offering a scalable and efficient solution for high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

TL;DR: Proposes OoPk, a novel pipeline for Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) in semantic segmentation, addressing catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation via orthogonal projection and online prior-knowledge aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods struggle with balancing performance and efficiency, especially in complex tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Uses orthogonal projection to preserve source model knowledge and an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy with image masking to enhance adaptability.

Result: Outperforms previous CTTA methods in semantic segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OoPk effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation, achieving competitive performance in CTTA tasks.

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale pretrained OMR models capable of handling full-page/multi-page scores and generating human-readable ABC notation.

Method: Combines a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder, trained on 214K+ images, and evaluates using diverse metrics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: Legato sets a new benchmark for end-to-end OMR with its generalization ability and ABC notation output.

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music
recognition (OMR). Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable
of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

TL;DR: HAWAII is a framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving VLMs' visual understanding without high computational overhead from multiple experts.

Method: Uses teacher-specific LoRA adapters with a router for conflict-free distillation, combining fine-grained (token importance) and coarse-grained (general-knowledge) distillation.

Result: Outperforms popular open-source VLMs on various vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: HAWAII effectively balances performance and efficiency by leveraging multiple experts' knowledge in a single encoder.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Vision Language Models (VLMs) infer emotions, focusing on visual cues like teeth and facial attributes, revealing potential risks like bias and shortcut learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the visual cues VLMs rely on for emotion recognition and whether these cues are psychologically grounded or superficially learned.

Method: Benchmarked VLMs on a teeth-annotated subset of AffectNet and introspected GPT-4o to analyze facial attributes like eyebrow position.

Result: VLMs show consistent performance shifts based on visible teeth, and GPT-4o's reasoning is driven by facial attributes, revealing internal consistency in predictions.

Conclusion: While VLMs exhibit emergent behavior in affective reasoning, they also pose risks like shortcut learning and bias, particularly in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of small, rare wildlife like prairie dogs is challenging but vital for conservation, as existing methods struggle with their elusive presence.

Method: RareSpot integrates multi-scale consistency learning for feature alignment and context-aware augmentation to synthesize difficult training instances.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by 35%, and generalizes well across wildlife datasets.

Conclusion: RareSpot advances ecological monitoring and sets a foundation for detecting small, rare species in aerial imagery.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for image editing are computationally intensive, and distilled models suffer from poor inversion quality, limiting their editing capabilities.

Method: Proposes a cycle-consistency optimization strategy to improve reconstruction accuracy and balance editability with content preservation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in image editing tasks, matching or surpassing full-step diffusion models while being more efficient.

Conclusion: The method offers a significant improvement in inversion quality and editing efficiency, with code available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrITTI introduces a latent diffusion-based framework using primitives for 3D semantic scene generation, offering better quality and memory efficiency than voxel-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel-based methods for 3D scene generation are memory-heavy, resolution-limited, and hard to edit. Primitives provide a compact, editable alternative.

Method: PrITTI uses a hybrid representation (rasterized ground, vectorized primitives) and a Cholesky-based parameterization for stable encoding of object size and orientation.

Result: PrITTI outperforms voxel-based methods in quality and reduces memory usage by 3x, enabling instance-level manipulation and supporting applications like inpainting.

Conclusion: PrITTI demonstrates the effectiveness of primitives for scalable, editable 3D scene generation, with practical applications in scene manipulation and synthesis.

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

### [62] [Lightweight RGB-T Tracking with Mobile Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19154)
*Mahdi Falaki,Maria A. Amer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm using MobileViT is proposed, achieving efficient performance with fewer parameters and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality tracking struggles in challenging conditions; multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T) is needed but often computationally expensive.

Method: Progressive fusion framework with separable attention for intra- and inter-modal interactions, leveraging MobileViT.

Result: Comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art, with <4M parameters and 122 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: First MobileViT-based RGB-T tracker, offering efficiency and performance; code and weights will be public.

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Mert Can Cakmak,Nitin Agarwal,Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a lightweight, perceptually-aligned framework for keyframe extraction in videos, designed for detecting standout moments without deep learning. It uses CIELAB color space and perceptual metrics, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online videos amplify cyber social threats like misinformation and radicalization. Detecting standout moments is vital for moderation and analysis.

Method: PRISM operates in CIELAB color space, using perceptual color difference metrics for keyframe extraction. It is interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient.

Result: Evaluated on BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots datasets, PRISM achieves strong accuracy, fidelity, and high compression ratios.

Conclusion: PRISM is effective for structured and unstructured video content, offering a scalable tool for moderating harmful or sensitive media.

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

*Jialu Pi,Juan Maria Farina,Rimita Lahiri,Jiwoong Jeong,Archana Gurudu,Hyung-Bok Park,Chieh-Ju Chao,Chadi Ayoub,Reza Arsanjani,Imon Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MOSCARD, a multimodal framework combining CXR and ECG for better MACE risk prediction, outperforming single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MACE is a leading global cause of mortality; current risk models are limited by bias and single-modality constraints.

Method: MOSCARD integrates CXR and ECG with causal reasoning and co-attention to align modalities and mitigate bias.

Result: MOSCARD achieved higher AUC (0.75, 0.83, 0.71) than single-modality and state-of-the-art models on internal and external datasets.

Conclusion: MOSCARD offers cost-effective opportunistic screening for early MACE intervention, improving outcomes and reducing disparities.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

TL;DR: OpenWildlife (OW) is an open-vocabulary wildlife detector using language-aware embeddings and Grounding-DINO for multi-species identification in aerial imagery, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated wildlife detectors struggle with generalization across species and environments due to limited taxonomic coverage and rigid architectures.

Method: OW uses language-aware embeddings and Grounding-DINO adaptation, trained on 15 datasets, and includes an efficient search algorithm for social species.

Result: OW achieves 0.981 mAP50 with fine-tuning and 0.597 mAP50 on novel species datasets, capturing 95% of species while exploring only 33% of images.

Conclusion: OW is a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity assessments, with publicly released code and dataset splits for reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

TL;DR: A survey on ancient script image recognition methods, categorizing studies by script types, addressing unique challenges like data imbalance and degradation, and outlining future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ancient scripts carry historical and cultural significance, but their recognition is challenging due to varied scripts and unique issues like data imbalance and degradation. Automating this process aids archaeology and digital humanities.

Method: Categorizes studies by script types, analyzes recognition methods, and reviews solutions like few-shot learning and noise-robust techniques.

Result: Highlights shared strategies and differences in methods, addresses challenges, and summarizes recent solutions.

Conclusion: Summarizes limitations and suggests future directions to advance ancient script recognition and interpretation.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedErr-CT is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in identifying and correcting errors in CT reports, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for CT exams raises concerns about diagnostic errors, and existing benchmarks lack clinical relevance.

Method: Introduces MedErr-CT, a VQA framework with six error categories and three task levels (classification, detection, correction).

Result: Quantitative assessment shows varied performance of 3D medical MLLMs across error types.

Conclusion: MedErr-CT aids in developing reliable MLLMs to reduce diagnostic errors and enhance clinical accuracy.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

*Minghao Qin,Xiangrui Liu,Zhengyang Liang,Yan Shu,Huaying Yuan,Juenjie Zhou,Shitao Xiao,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-XL-2 is a novel MLLM for long-video understanding, using task-aware KV sparsification to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long video inputs due to high computational and memory costs, limiting performance and efficiency.

Method: Video-XL-2 employs chunk-based pre-filling (full attention within chunks, sparse attention across chunks) and bi-level key-value decoding (selective reloading of dense/sparse key-values).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on long video benchmarks, processing 10,000+ frames efficiently on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: Video-XL-2 addresses the challenge of long-video understanding with superior cost-effectiveness and performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSR-Align, a dataset for improving safety alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against harmful multimodal prompts, enhancing robustness while maintaining reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods for unimodal models fail to address the nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs, and current datasets lack fine-grained reasoning for VLMs.

Method: The authors develop MSR-Align, a dataset with fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning across vision and text, generated with multimodal diversity and quality filtering.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align improves robustness against jailbreak attacks and preserves general reasoning performance.

Conclusion: MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing safety alignment in reasoning-capable VLMs, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our
dataset is made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in data gathering and annotation for novel or sensitive tasks by automating dataset creation.

Method: Introduces AIR-Gen for dataset generation with prompt engineering and distribution adjustment, and AIR-Aug for dataset enhancement.

Result: Demonstrates robust image recognition performance and high user satisfaction (4.4/5.0).

Conclusion: AIR effectively automates dataset synthesis and model training, offering a scalable solution for diverse tasks.

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) is proposed to improve long-range dependency capture in remote sensing change detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based approaches fail to effectively capture long-range dependencies between image channels, limiting feature representation.

Method: Introduces 3D-SSM for global information capture, along with spatiotemporal interaction (SIM) and multi-branch feature extraction (MBFEM) modules.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D-SSM and auxiliary modules enhance change detection by improving feature representation and integration.

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes CAN and SPCAN for unsupervised domain adaptation, combining collaborative and adversarial learning to improve feature representation and target domain discriminability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address domain distribution mismatch and enhance discriminability in target domains for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Method: Uses domain-collaborative and adversarial learning, formulated as domain classifier learning. Introduces SPCAN for progressive pseudo-labeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for object and video action recognition.

Conclusion: CAN and SPCAN effectively improve unsupervised domain adaptation through collaborative and adversarial strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Conclusion: AirV2X-Perception is a valuable open-source resource for advancing UAV-assisted autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems

"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial

complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaterCaption, a novel captioning dataset for waterway environments, and Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal model with a Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA) for efficient long-text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing waterway perception models lack global semantic understanding, limiting large-scale monitoring. The paper addresses this gap using vision-language models.

Method: Develops WaterCaption dataset (20.2k image-text pairs) and proposes Da Yu model with NTA for efficient visual feature modeling.

Result: Da Yu outperforms state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and other benchmarks, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: WaterCaption and Da Yu advance waterway environment understanding and enable structured log generation for USVs.

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

TL;DR: HoliGS is a deformable Gaussian splatting framework for embodied view synthesis from long monocular videos, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods like 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRFs face challenges with training overhead in long captures. HoliGS aims to address this by accurately reconstructing large-scale, dynamic environments.

Method: Decomposes scenes into static backgrounds and time-varying objects using Gaussian primitives. Employs hierarchical warping with global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and non-rigid deformations via invertible neural flow.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality and reduces training/rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs.

Conclusion: HoliGS offers a practical, scalable solution for embodied view synthesis in real-world scenarios, with plans to release the source code.

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VLM-guided cascaded framework for Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS), improving segmentation and classification by leveraging SAM and avoiding domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of segmenting and classifying camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, overcoming domain gaps and imprecise segmentation in existing methods.

Method: Uses a VLM-guided framework with SAM for segmentation, employing VLM-derived features as prompts. For classification, treats segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel to retain full image context.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on OVCOS and conventional benchmarks, showing improved localization accuracy and context-aware classification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages VLM semantics for precise segmentation and classification of camouflaged objects, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

### [77] [Airway Skill Assessment with Spatiotemporal Attention Mechanisms Using Human Gaze](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19306)
*Jean-Paul Ainam,Rahul,Lora Cavuoto,Matthew Hackett,Jack Norfleet,Suvranu De*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using human gaze data and video recordings improves the assessment of endotracheal intubation (ETI) skills, outperforming traditional subjective methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subjective evaluations of airway management skills, like ETI, often lack real-world competency assessment. A more objective, accurate method is needed, especially in high-stress environments.

Method: The system uses gaze data and video recordings to guide an attention mechanism. Visual masks from gaze points focus on task-relevant areas. An autoencoder extracts features, an attention module processes gaze data, and a classifier outputs scores.

Result: The method improves accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness in ETI assessment, demonstrating better performance than traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating human gaze data enhances model performance, offering a robust, objective tool for clinical skill assessment, with potential to improve training and patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

*Junsei Tokumitsu,Yuiga Wada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LM-AD for affordance detection in 3D point clouds, introducing AQM for fine-grained alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained alignments between point clouds and text due to reliance on simple cosine similarity.

Method: Introduces LM-AD with Affordance Query Module (AQM) leveraging a pretrained language model for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on 3D AffordanceNet dataset.

Conclusion: LM-AD with AQM effectively addresses fine-grained affordance detection in 3D point clouds.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

### [79] [Progressive Modality Cooperation for Multi-Modality Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19316)
*Weichen Zhang,Dong Xu,Jing Zhang,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) framework for multi-modality domain adaptation, handling both MMDA and MMDA-PI settings, with modules for modality cooperation and missing modality generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transfer knowledge from source to target domains using multiple modalities (e.g., RGB and depth) under varying modality availability.

Method: PMC framework with modules for reliable pseudo-label selection and modality cooperation; PMC-PI with MMG network for generating missing modalities.

Result: Effective performance on three image and eight video datasets for cross-domain recognition tasks.

Conclusion: PMC is a robust solution for multi-modality domain adaptation, adaptable to missing modalities in target domains.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

*Yuang Yao,Ruiqi Wu,Yi Zhou,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetCoP is a continual vision-language pre-training framework for fundus images, integrating multiple modalities incrementally while mitigating forgetting through rehearsal and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models lack versatility by ignoring modality complementarity; RetCoP addresses this by unifying multiple fundus imaging modalities dynamically.

Method: RetCoP uses rehearsal with representative image-text pairs and off-diagonal information distillation to prevent forgetting in continual pre-training.

Result: RetCoP outperforms compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting rate.

Conclusion: RetCoP successfully integrates multi-modal fundus data incrementally, offering a robust solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

*Mingcheng Qu,Guang Yang,Donglin Di,Yue Gao,Tonghua Su,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal survival prediction framework using hypergraph learning to integrate pathology slides and genomics data, addressing modality imbalance and incomplete data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on FFPE slides and neglect FF slides, suffer from modality imbalance, and require complete data, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes hypergraph learning for effective multimodal fusion and a memory mechanism to handle incomplete modalities.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods by 2.3% in C-Index and surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models (7.9%) in incomplete scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework improves cancer survival prediction by addressing modality imbalance and incomplete data, enhancing clinical utility.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of edge-based segmentation methods, especially for noisy images or those with weak boundaries, by leveraging regional intensity differences.

Method: Derived from the Mumford-Shah framework, the model uses level set formulation, divergence theorem, and curve evolution theory, implemented in Python with finite difference methods and numerical stability measures.

Result: The model achieves accurate segmentation, robustness to noise, and outperforms classical edge-based methods in experiments on medical and synthetic images.

Conclusion: The Chan-Vese model is highly suitable for complex segmentation tasks and holds promise for real-world imaging applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionEcho is a training-free framework for motion customization in distilled video generation models, using teacher forcing to improve motion fidelity and quality without sacrificing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distilled video generation models lack motion customization under training-free settings due to their accelerated generative process and large denoising steps.

Method: MotionEcho leverages diffusion teacher forcing, using slow teacher models to guide fast student models via endpoint prediction and interpolation, with dynamic computation allocation.

Result: The method significantly enhances motion fidelity and generation quality across various models and datasets while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: MotionEcho effectively addresses motion customization challenges in distilled models, offering a practical solution for high-quality, efficient video generation.

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

*Jiahe Chen,Naoki Tomii,Ichiro Sakuma,Etsuko Kobayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for tissue deformation recovery from stereo endoscopic images, addressing issues like camera motion, occlusion, and large deformations by modeling geometry and deformation with 3D point and derivative maps, and optimizing inter-frame alignment without camera pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve tool-tissue interaction analysis for surgical navigation and autonomous manipulation by overcoming limitations of prior work, such as reliance on offline processing and lack of biomechanical priors.

Method: Models tissue geometry as 3D point and derivative maps and deformation as 3D displacement and local deformation maps. Uses 6 parameters for rigid motion and 3 for local deformation per point, optimizing inter-frame alignment without camera pose estimation. Introduces canonical map for online optimization.

Result: Achieves 3D reconstruction accuracy of 0.37±0.27 mm (non-occluded) and 0.39±0.21 mm (occluded) in surface distance. Estimates surface strain distribution for mechanical analysis.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers tissue deformation in real-time, handles occlusion, and provides accurate 3D reconstruction and strain analysis, enhancing surgical applications.

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text readability in VLMs emerges abruptly after extensive training, unlike gradual semantic understanding, suggesting contrastive learning prioritizes general semantics first.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how text recognition develops in VLMs compared to semantic understanding.

Method: Analyzed training dynamics of VLMs, focusing on text readability and semantic content understanding.

Result: Text readability emerges late, while semantic understanding develops early; matching images with rendered text is even slower.

Conclusion: Tailored training strategies are needed to enhance text comprehension in VLMs, guiding future multimodal learning research.

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HDD, a hierarchical diffusion model for efficient climate downscaling, reducing computational load while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional downscaling methods are computationally demanding, and while AI models like diffusion models show promise, they remain intensive. HDD aims to address this.

Method: HDD uses a hierarchical sampling process within the diffusion framework, employing a coarse-to-fine hierarchy via downsampling.

Result: HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 and CMIP6 datasets, reducing computational load by up to half. It also transfers well across resolutions.

Conclusion: HDD provides a lightweight, efficient solution for probabilistic climate downscaling, enabling affordable high-resolution projections.

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

Motivation: The demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation in UHR remote sensing has grown, but existing methods struggle with computational efficiency and feature fusion.

Method: GLCANet uses a dual-stream architecture with self-attention and masked cross-attention mechanisms to fuse global semantics and local details efficiently.

Result: GLCANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency, handling large images with minimal GPU usage.

Conclusion: GLCANet offers a promising solution for real-world remote sensing applications due to its efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for detecting micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) using event cameras by focusing on propeller features in event streams, outperforming RGB-based methods without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV detection methods rely on RGB images, which lack generalized detection due to diverse appearances. Event cameras capture propeller features better.

Method: Three modules extract propeller features from event streams while filtering noise. A novel event-based MAV dataset is introduced.

Result: Achieves 83.0% precision (+30.3%) and 81.5% recall (+36.4%) on the new dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Event-based detection is effective for MAVs, and the introduced dataset aids future research.

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

*Lixuan He,Haoyu Dong,Zhenxing Chen,Yangcheng Yu,Jie Feng,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mem4Nav introduces a hierarchical spatial-cognition memory system for VLN, combining fine-grained voxel indexing and semantic topology graphs, improving navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prior modular pipelines (lack unified memory) and end-to-end agents (fixed context windows, implicit spatial reasoning) in VLN tasks.

Method: Hierarchical memory system (Mem4Nav) with sparse octree for voxel indexing and semantic topology graph, using trainable memory tokens and reversible Transformer. Includes long-term (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) modules.

Result: 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, reduced SPD, and >10 pp nDTW improvement across three backbones.

Conclusion: Mem4Nav's hierarchical map and dual memory modules are essential for performance, validated by ablations. Code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

*Congjing Yu,Jing Ye,Yang Liu,Xiaodong Zhang,Zhiyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMF-MedIT introduces an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework for integrating medical image and tabular data, addressing cross-modal discrepancies and noise. It includes the AMF module and FT-Mamba encoder, achieving superior performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in multimodal medical analysis include cross-modal discrepancies, noise in tabular data, and data scarcity. AMF-MedIT aims to harmonize these issues for better integration.

Method: Proposes the AMF module for adaptive modulation and fusion, and FT-Mamba for noisy tabular data. Uses feature masks, density/leakage losses, and interpretability studies.

Result: AMF-MedIT balances performance and data efficiency, adapts to incomplete tabular data, and provides interpretable insights into tabular feature extraction.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multimodal medical data, offering adaptability, efficiency, and interpretability, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

### [94] [Sampling Matters in Explanations: Towards Trustworthy Attribution Analysis Building Block in Visual Models through Maximizing Explanation Certainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19442)
*Róisín Luo,James McDermott,Colm O'Riordan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sample distribution misalignment problem in gradient integration for image attribution analysis, proposing a semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features to improve explanation certainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using noisy samples lead to low explanation certainty due to misalignment with natural image distribution. The paper aims to build trustworthy attribution analysis by resolving this misalignment.

Method: Introduces a semi-optimal sampling approach that suppresses features from inputs, aligning the sample distribution with natural image distribution.

Result: Extensive evaluation on ImageNet shows the approach yields more satisfactory explanations than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Suppressing features in sampling improves alignment with natural image distribution, enhancing explanation certainty in attribution analysis.

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Motivation: To address the lack of large, diverse real-world datasets for image deblurring, which limits model robustness and generalizability.

Method: Constructed by averaging 240 frames from slow-motion videos to simulate blur, using the centered frame as a sharp reference.

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from
smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we
simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the

*Farnood Salehi,Vandit Sharma,Amirhossein Askari Farsangi,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-step method to improve synthetic data for training deep learning models, reducing the performance gap with real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real image datasets are hard to curate and pose privacy/legal issues, while existing synthetic data underperforms.

Method: 1) Improved neural fractal formulation for synthetic data. 2) Reverse stylization to transfer real image features to synthetic data.

Result: Reduced domain gap (measured by KID), 11% lower FID in image generation, 20% lower autoencoder error, and 10% higher ImageNet-100 accuracy.

Conclusion: The method enables practical model training when real datasets are unavailable, with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Motivation: Existing Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning and interpretability, limiting their reliability and clinical potential.

Method: Developed the Surgery-R1-54k dataset and proposed Surgery-R1, a Reasoning MLLM with a two-stage fine-tuning mechanism (SFT and RFT) and a Multimodal Coherence reward system.

Result: Surgery-R1 outperforms existing SOTA models in Surgical-VQLA tasks and demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reasoning and interpretability in Surgical-VQLA, with potential for clinical applications. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and
dataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1.

TL;DR: The paper introduces USIS16K, a large-scale dataset for underwater salient instance segmentation (USIS), addressing the lack of annotated data in this field. It also provides benchmark evaluations for underwater object detection and USIS tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater salient instance segmentation (USIS) is underexplored due to the dynamic nature of underwater environments and lack of annotated datasets. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors introduce USIS16K, a dataset of 16,151 high-resolution underwater images with instance-level annotations, covering 158 categories. Benchmark evaluations are also provided.

Result: USIS16K offers diversity, complexity, and scalability, advancing research in USIS. Benchmark models and the dataset are made publicly available.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a valuable dataset and benchmarks to support future research in underwater salient instance segmentation.

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and
benchmark models are publicly available.

*Yuanhe Tian,Lei Mao,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based method for CT report generation uses recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions to improve alignment between CT slices and text, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CT report generation fail to account for transformations among slices or integrate multi-level features, especially for organ lesions.

Method: Proposes a vision Transformer for recurrent slice processing and stereo attentions to align visual and textual features for LLM-based report generation.

Result: Outperforms baselines on the M3D-Cap dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The method is valid and effective for CT report generation, leveraging hierarchical feature modeling.

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer, improves corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis by combining hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with block-masked SSL, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is crucial, but current automated methods using Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) face inefficiencies in feature extraction and data limitations.

Method: HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding for multi-scale feature extraction. It uses block-masked self-supervised learning (SSL) to reduce reliance on labeled data and a multi-scale decoder for segmentation and classification.

Result: HMSViT achieves 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming models like Swin Transformer and HiViT by up to 6.39% while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: HMSViT offers robust, clinically viable results, demonstrating potential for scalable real-world diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

TL;DR: SceneCrafter is a 3D-consistent editor for realistic manipulation of driving scenes, addressing challenges in cross-camera consistency, empty street priors, and paired image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely synthetic scenes lack grounding in reality, while existing editing models face challenges in 3D consistency and data generation for driving simulation.

Method: SceneCrafter uses multi-view diffusion models for controllable, multi-modality editing and introduces frameworks for paired data generation and alpha-blending for local edits.

Result: SceneCrafter achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and editing quality.

Conclusion: SceneCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in driving scene editing, offering a versatile solution for realistic AV simulation.

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual hallucination in LVLMs, introduces the PRE-HAL dataset for evaluation, and proposes a DST-based detection method to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrepancies between visual inputs and textual outputs in LVLMs pose risks in safety-critical AI applications, necessitating better evaluation and detection methods.

Method: Developed the PRE-HAL dataset for systematic evaluation and proposed a DST-based method for detecting visual hallucinations through uncertainty estimation.

Result: The method outperformed baselines, achieving AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs.

Conclusion: The PRE-HAL benchmark and DST-based method effectively address visual hallucination, enhancing LVLM reliability.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our
code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (ReMAR-DS) reduces metal artifacts in kVCT and transforms it to MVCT-like images, improving radiotherapy planning and reducing patient radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in kVCT degrade image quality, affecting clinical decisions. The goal is to reduce these artifacts and bridge the gap between kVCT and MVCT for better radiotherapy planning.

Method: Uses an encoder-decoder architecture with enhanced feature recalibration to focus on artifact regions and preserve anatomical structures, producing MVCT-like reconstructions.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm improved artifact reduction and high-quality MVCT-like images, enabling reliance on kVCT alone.

Conclusion: The framework enhances radiotherapy planning by reducing artifacts and radiation exposure, making kVCT sufficient for clinical use.

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

*Ankita Raj,Ambar Pal,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to detect and identify natural-looking backdoor triggers in face recognition systems, achieving 74% top-5 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in face recognition systems pose security risks, especially with natural triggers like sunglasses or hats.

Method: Proposes a technique to detect compromised networks and identify natural triggers, outperforming brute-force baselines.

Result: Achieves 74% top-5 accuracy in trigger identification, compared to 56% for brute force.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses backdoor threats in FR systems, enhancing security.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether to pretrain custom foundation models on medical data or use transfer-learning from generalist models, using a fetal ultrasound dataset. It finds custom pretraining with DINOv2 yields state-of-the-art results, outperforming natural image models, and suggests avoiding methodological over-innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if custom pretraining on medical data is better than transfer-learning from generalist models, and if novel methods are needed for such pretraining.

Method: A case-study using DINOv2 to pretrain a foundation model on 2M fetal ultrasound images, comparing it against models pretrained on natural images, ultrasound, and supervised baselines.

Result: Custom pretraining outperforms transfer-learning, showing scaling in natural images doesn't translate to ultrasound. Well-tuned computer vision methods work without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Custom pretraining is valuable for medical domains, and methodological innovation is unnecessary under common resource constraints.

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

### [106] [MambaOutRS: A Hybrid CNN-Fourier Architecture for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19561)
*Minjong Cheon,Changbae Mun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaOutRS introduces a hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image classification, replacing recurrent SSMs with stacked Gated CNN blocks and a Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) for global context, achieving SOTA performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies of adapting State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba to 2D visual data by proposing a simpler, more efficient alternative.

Method: Uses stacked Gated CNN blocks for local features and a novel FFG module in the frequency domain for global context, implemented in a four-stage hierarchical design.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on UC Merced (98.41% F1), AID (95.99% F1), and other datasets, outperforming larger transformer and Mamba-based models.

Conclusion: MambaOutRS demonstrates that recurrent SSMs can be effectively replaced by gated convolutions and frequency-based gates, offering a computationally efficient paradigm for vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

*Gencer Sumbul,Chang Xu,Emanuele Dalsasso,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARTIES is a foundation model for multi-sensor remote sensing, enabling scalable and generalized processing by projecting data into a shared spectrum-aware space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models are sensor-specific, limiting scalability and generalization. SMARTIES aims to unify multi-sensor data processing.

Method: SMARTIES uses a transformer model to reconstruct masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup, projecting data into a shared space.

Result: SMARTIES outperforms sensor-specific models in single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors.

Conclusion: SMARTIES provides a scalable, sensor-agnostic solution for remote sensing, enhancing flexibility and performance.

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

*Lujun Li,Yiqun Wang,Radu State*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using Vision Transformer (ViT) reconstructs cloud-covered multispectral imagery (MSI) by combining time-series MSI and SAR data, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover in MSI disrupts early season crop mapping, while SAR data lacks spectral detail. Combining both addresses these limitations.

Method: Proposes Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using ViT, leveraging temporal coherence of MSI and SAR's complementary data via attention mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms baselines using non-time-series MSI/SAR or time-series MSI alone, improving reconstruction in cloud-covered areas.

Conclusion: The Time-series ViT framework effectively enhances MSI reconstruction by integrating temporal and complementary SAR data.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleCap is an inference-time scalable image captioning strategy that generates detailed captions by addressing biases in LVLMs through heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome biases in LVLMs, such as imbalanced descriptive granularity and hallucinated descriptions, to produce more accurate and comprehensive image captions.

Method: ScaleCap uses heuristic question answering to inject relevant information and contrastive sentence rating to eliminate hallucinations. It scales with increased inference budget for richer captions.

Result: ScaleCap improves caption accuracy and balance, demonstrated by modality alignment experiments and performance gains on 11 benchmarks. It also excels in VQA and image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: ScaleCap effectively addresses LVLM biases, producing high-quality captions with scalability, and enhances LVLM pretraining and downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs by eliminating the need for 3D labels and improving efficiency in training.

Method: Uses heuristic-based image pixel sampling for efficient training and a Double Gradient mask to preserve LiDAR point features.

Result: Achieves best performance on LiDAR and Camera domains in the KITTI-360 dataset.

Conclusion: NVSF is a robust, self-supervised framework for dynamic scene representation, offering improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR

both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline
models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera

Conclusion: VideoPCDNet provides an effective unsupervised solution for object-centric video decomposition and prediction, with interpretable results.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of

TL;DR: HOIverse is a synthetic dataset for scene understanding in indoor environments, focusing on human-object interactions and scene graphs, with rich annotations and benchmarks for SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks reliable datasets for scene understanding in indoor environments with humans, necessitating a structured representation like scene graphs.

Method: HOIverse provides dense relationship ground truths, RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images, and human keypoints, with parametric relations computed for accuracy.

Result: The dataset enables benchmarking of SOTA scene graph generation models for predicting human-object interactions and parametric relations.

Conclusion: HOIverse aims to advance research in scene understanding involving humans by providing a comprehensive synthetic dataset.

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention mechanisms in VLMs have quadratic complexity, limiting their application to long video understanding.

Method: PEVLM partitions input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions.

Result: PEVLM achieves up to 8.37% accuracy improvement, 7.47x speedup in attention computation, and 40% reduction in end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: PEVLM is effective for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it suitable for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces xarrayvideo, a Python library for compressing large-scale Earth system datasets by treating them as videos, achieving high compression ratios without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling rapidly growing Earth observation datasets by leveraging video compression techniques.

Method: Uses established video codecs via ffmpeg to compress multichannel spatiotemporal datasets, demonstrated on four real-world datasets.

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to 250x with high fidelity (PSNRs 40.60-65.91 dB) and redistributes datasets at significantly reduced sizes without quality loss.

Conclusion: xarrayvideo provides an efficient, accessible solution for compressing Earth observation datasets, maintaining quality for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

*Yang Xing,Jiong Wu,Yuheng Bu,Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2-SGP improves medical image segmentation by automating prompts and addressing domain shift, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's reliance on manual prompts and domain shift from natural to medical images limits its effectiveness in medical segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposed SAM2-SGP with Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) and Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) modules, plus low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for domain shift.

Result: Outperformed nnUNet, SwinUNet, SAM2, and MedSAM2 across 2D/3D medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP effectively automates prompts and mitigates domain shift, enhancing medical image segmentation performance.

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision oncology needs cost-effective, rapid molecular insights, but current deep learning struggles with WSI-based predictions.

Method: PathLUPI leverages transcriptomic privileged information to create genome-anchored histological embeddings for WSI-based molecular predictions.

Result: PathLUPI achieved AUC ≥0.80 in 14 tasks and C-index ≥0.70 in survival cohorts, revealing genotype-linked morphological signatures.

Conclusion: PathLUPI bridges molecular insights with pathology workflows, enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

*Xuesong Li,Dianye Huang,Yameng Zhang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scene graph (SG) method for ultrasound images to improve interpretability and scanning guidance for non-experts, validated on neck region images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of medical ultrasound interpretability and the unmet need for basic scanning guidance among non-expert users.

Method: Uses a transformer-based one-stage method to compute ultrasound SGs, refined by LLMs for user queries, and explores SGs for scanning guidance.

Result: Validated on neck region images, showing potential to democratize ultrasound by enhancing usability for non-experts.

Conclusion: The SG-based approach improves ultrasound interpretability and scanning guidance, making it more accessible to ordinary users.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

*Yue Zhou,Yuan Bi,Wenjuan Tong,Wei Wang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraAD is a vision-language model for precise anomaly detection in ultrasound images, improving localization and fine-grained classification using few-shot examples and text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods lack fine-grained differentiation (e.g., benign vs. malignant tumors) and struggle with domain gaps in ultrasound imaging.

Method: UltraAD fuses image-level tokens with text embeddings for localization and uses a memory bank of few-shot samples for classification. Text embeddings remain frozen, while image features adapt to medical data.

Result: UltraAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three breast US datasets in lesion localization and fine-grained classification.

Conclusion: UltraAD addresses domain gaps and fine-grained classification challenges in medical anomaly detection, showing superior performance.

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates fisheye camera models for 3D human pose estimation, finding that advanced models like the double sphere improve accuracy, and introduces a dataset (FISHnCHIPS) for testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate human pose detection in fisheye images is challenging due to distortions, and existing methods lack systematic evaluation for wide-FOV poses.

Method: Evaluated pinhole, equidistant, double sphere models, and cylindrical projections for 3D pose estimation, proposing a heuristic for model selection.

Result: Pinhole projection is inadequate for close-ups; optimal model varies with FOV. Double sphere model enhances accuracy.

Conclusion: Advanced fisheye models improve pose estimation; the FISHnCHIPS dataset supports further research.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

*Junwei Zhou,Xueting Li,Lu Qi,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo4D is a framework for generating detailed 4D scenes from text prompts, optionally with images, by separating dynamic foreground and evolving background synthesis guided by a motion sequence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D synthesis methods lack multi-view consistency and immersion in dynamic scenes, limiting their practical use.

Method: CoCo4D divides synthesis into dynamic foreground and evolving background, guided by a motion sequence, using progressive outpainting and parametric trajectory optimization.

Result: CoCo4D outperforms existing methods in generating realistic and coherent 4D scenes.

Conclusion: CoCo4D effectively addresses limitations in 4D scene synthesis, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

### [122] [One Prototype Is Enough: Single-Prototype Activation for Interpretable Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19808)
*Yitao Peng,Lianghua He,Die Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoSolo is a deep neural architecture for interpretable image classification using a single prototype activation, reducing cognitive complexity and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype networks rely on multiple prototypes for classification, complicating explanations. ProtoSolo simplifies this by using a single prototype.

Method: ProtoSolo uses feature map comparison and non-prototype projection learning to enhance classification and maintain interpretability.

Result: Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars show superior classification performance and lower cognitive complexity.

Conclusion: ProtoSolo achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and performance, simplifying explanations for image classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

*Yubo Huang,Weiqiang Wang,Sirui Zhao,Tong Xu,Lin Liu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bind-Your-Avatar, a model for generating multi-talking-character videos in the same scene, addressing challenges like audio-to-character correspondence and dataset scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single-character scenarios, leaving multi-character conversations in shared environments unaddressed. The lack of datasets and control mechanisms motivates this work.

Method: The proposed MM-DiT-based model includes an Embedding Router for audio-to-character binding, a 3D-mask embedding router for fine-grained control, and introduces a new dataset and benchmark.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating dual-talking-character videos, demonstrating improved accuracy and temporal smoothness.

Conclusion: Bind-Your-Avatar effectively addresses multi-character video generation challenges, offering a novel framework, dataset, and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

*Liangbin Xie,Yu Li,Shian Du,Menghan Xia,Xintao Wang,Fanghua Yu,Ziyan Chen,Pengfei Wan,Jiantao Zhou,Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage video generation framework using latent diffusion models, focusing on optimizing cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) models for high-resolution outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User demand for higher-resolution video outputs necessitates improvements beyond latent computation alone, prompting exploration of efficient two-stage generation (semantic content and detail synthesis).

Method: The study introduces degradation strategies for training alignment, analyzes VSR model behavior (timestep sampling, noise augmentation), and proposes architectural innovations (interleaving temporal unit, sparse local attention) for efficiency.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies validating each design choice's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work establishes a practical baseline for cascaded VSR, offering insights for future efficient synthesis systems.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

*Moayed Haji-Ali,Willi Menapace,Ivan Skorokhodov,Arpit Sahni,Sergey Tulyakov,Vicente Ordonez,Aliaksandr Siarohin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFM is a simple, effective framework for progressive visual generation, improving quality and efficiency over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional visual generation is computationally intensive, and existing multi-stage approaches add complexity. DFM aims to simplify this.

Method: DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a multi-scale representation (e.g., Laplacian pyramid).

Result: DFM improves visual quality for images/videos, with 35.2% better FDD scores on Imagenet-1k 512px and faster convergence for large models.

Conclusion: DFM achieves superior results with simplicity, minimal modifications, and a single model.

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

*Zekun Li,Rui Zhou,Rahul Sajnani,Xiaoyan Cong,Daniel Ritchie,Srinath Sridhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenHSI is a training-free method for generating long human-scene interaction videos by subdividing the task into script writing, pre-visualization, and animation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models struggle with generating long, realistic human-scene interaction videos due to issues like unrealistic interactions, identity loss, and high training costs.

Method: GenHSI divides the task into three stages: script writing (breaking tasks into atomic actions), pre-visualization (creating 3D keyframes), and animation (rendering with video diffusion models).

Result: The method generates long, consistent videos with preserved character identity and plausible human-scene interactions from single-view images, without requiring training.

Conclusion: GenHSI successfully addresses key challenges in long video generation, offering a practical, training-free solution for rich human-scene interactions.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

*Zirui Wang,Yash Bhalgat,Ruining Li,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction as a 2D image quality assessment task, using a cross-reference IQA framework for faster and more efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for view selection require specialized designs for 3D representations and complex 3D modeling. The paper aims to simplify this by leveraging 2D image quality assessment.

Method: The approach trains a model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup, using it to guide view selection without relying on ground-truth images.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements in benchmarks, is agnostic to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

Conclusion: The cross-reference IQA framework offers a simpler, faster, and more versatile solution for active view selection in 3D tasks.

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

Motivation: To explore and validate the effectiveness of NAFNet's core components (SimpleGate, SCA, LayerNorm) in image restoration tasks.

Method: Ablation study on CIFAR10 corrupted images, comparing baseline NAFNet with variants where components are replaced or removed. Metrics: PSNR, SSIM.

Result: SimpleGate and SCA outperform conventional activations and attention. LayerNorm ensures stable training.

Conclusion: NAFNet's design is effective; SimpleGate, SCA, and LayerNorm are key. Future work includes potential improvements and extensions.

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient
deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted
with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components.
Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel
Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different
variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future
work.

TL;DR: UniVLA is a unified vision-language-action model that autoregressively models multimodal signals as token sequences, excelling in robotic manipulation tasks by leveraging temporal and causal structures in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VLAs rely on general VLMs for action signals, missing the temporal and causal dynamics in visual data. UniVLA addresses this gap.

Method: UniVLA models vision, language, and action as discrete token sequences, enabling flexible learning from large-scale video data and incorporating world modeling for causal dynamics.

Result: UniVLA achieves state-of-the-art results, e.g., 95.5% success on LIBERO, surpassing prior methods like pi0-FAST (85.5%). It also performs well in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: UniVLA's unified approach and world modeling enhance robotic manipulation, setting new benchmarks and demonstrating real-world applicability.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimaX is a 3D animation framework that combines video diffusion models with skeleton-based animation, enabling scalable and efficient motion synthesis for diverse articulated meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion synthesis methods are limited by fixed skeletal topologies or high-dimensional optimization, prompting the need for a more flexible and efficient solution.

Method: AnimaX represents 3D motion as 2D pose maps, uses joint video-pose diffusion, and employs shared positional encodings for alignment. It triangulates multi-view poses into 3D joint positions and converts them into mesh animation.

Result: AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench for generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, trained on 160,000 rigged sequences.

Conclusion: AnimaX offers a scalable, category-agnostic solution for 3D animation by effectively transferring video priors to motion generation.

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

TL;DR: Proposes Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism for video diffusion models, reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high computational costs of video diffusion models by leveraging observed Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in attention scores.

Method: Introduces Radial Attention, a sparse attention mechanism with O(n log n) complexity, using static masks and shrinking attention windows.

Result: Achieves up to 1.9× speedup, enables 4× longer video generation, reduces training costs by 4.4×, and accelerates inference by 3.7×.

Conclusion: Radial Attention efficiently scales video diffusion models without sacrificing quality, offering significant computational savings.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

### [132] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques Shojaee et al.'s (2025) claim of a reasoning cliff in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), arguing it's due to experimental flaws, not fundamental limitations. It shows tool-enabled models can solve problems beyond the alleged cliff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the notion that LRMs have intrinsic reasoning limits by highlighting experimental artifacts and demonstrating the impact of tool use on performance.

Method: Empirically refutes the reasoning cliff claim by enabling models with agentic tools, solving problems previously deemed impossible, and analyzing tool-enabled models' reasoning hierarchies.

Result: Tool-enabled models surpass the reasoning cliff, solving complex problems and exhibiting advanced reasoning capabilities, disproving the original claim.

Conclusion: The perceived reasoning deficit in LRMs is due to restrictive interfaces, not cognitive limitations, emphasizing the need for better evaluation paradigms.

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

TL;DR: A framework for AI systems with probabilistic agents using Bayesian inference, competition, and belief revision to evolve toward truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system where truth emerges from structured competition and belief revision among agents.

Method: Uses Bayesian inference, measure theory, population dynamics, and cryptographic identities. Agents compete, update beliefs, and reproduce based on alignment with an oracle.

Result: Formal theorems prove convergence, robustness, and evolutionary stability, showing truth as an attractor.

Conclusion: Verifiable knowledge arises from adversarial pressure in a self-regulating swarm.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated data-curation pipeline for software engineering (SWE) datasets, scaling volume and diversity. Fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE model on this data shows continuous performance improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on the SWE-bench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data curation in SWE is time-consuming, limiting dataset size and diversity. The paper aims to automate this process to enable larger, more diverse datasets for training LLMs.

Method: Proposes an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline for SWE datasets, including natural language tasks and runtime-environment images. Fine-tunes the Skywork-SWE model on this data.

Result: The model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on SWE-bench without verifiers, improving to 47.0% with test-time scaling, surpassing previous SOTA for sub-32B models.

Conclusion: Automated data curation and scaling improve LLM performance in SWE tasks, with the Skywork-SWE model setting new benchmarks. The model checkpoint is released for future research.

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

### [135] [NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Dependency Graphs for Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19500)
*Yan Jiang,Hao Zhou,LiZhong GU,Ai Han,TianLong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NaviAgent introduces a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling in LLMs, outperforming baselines in task success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with static knowledge and fragile tool invocation, hindering complex toolchain orchestration. Existing methods lack flexibility and error recovery.

Method: NaviAgent uses a Multi-Path Decider for dynamic action selection and a Graph-Encoded Navigator with a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG) for efficient toolchain planning.

Result: NaviAgent achieves higher task success rates (13.5%-19.0% over baselines) and maintains efficiency, with fine-tuned models surpassing larger ones.

Conclusion: NaviAgent's architecture significantly improves toolchain orchestration, especially for complex tasks, demonstrating the value of dynamic planning and graph-based navigation.

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

*Baochang Ren,Shuofei Qiao,Wenhao Yu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowRL integrates knowledge verification into RL to reduce hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs, improving fact-based reasoning while maintaining strong reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the severe hallucination in slow-thinking LLMs caused by unclear knowledge boundaries and lack of factual supervision in RL.

Method: Propose Knowledge-enhanced RL (KnowRL), which adds a factuality reward based on knowledge verification to the RL training process.

Result: KnowRL reduces hallucinations in slow-thinking models and maintains reasoning capabilities, as shown in experiments on hallucination and reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs by integrating fact-based rewards, enhancing reliability without compromising reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

*Johannes Rückert,Louise Bloch,Christoph M. Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze diagrams for adherence to data visualization guidelines, identifying strengths and weaknesses in their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers often misuse diagrams, leading to misinformation. The study aims to automate the identification of visualization issues using VLMs.

Method: Five VLMs and five prompting strategies were tested on questions derived from data visualization guidelines.

Result: VLMs excelled in analyzing diagram types, 3D effects, and legends but struggled with image quality and tick marks. Qwen2.5VL and summarizing prompting performed best.

Conclusion: VLMs can effectively identify common diagram issues, offering potential for broader application in data visualization analysis.

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

### [138] [Assessing Risk of Stealing Proprietary Models for Medical Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19464)
*Ankita Raj,Harsh Swaika,Deepankar Varma,Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores model stealing (MS) attacks on black-box medical imaging models, showing their vulnerability even with limited query budgets, and proposes a two-step method, QueryWise, to enhance MS capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the susceptibility of proprietary medical imaging models to MS attacks, given their deployment in diagnostic workflows and the lack of prior exploration in this domain.

Method: The study uses publicly available datasets to execute MS attacks and introduces QueryWise, a two-step approach leveraging unlabeled proxy data to train thief models without extra queries.

Result: The proposed QueryWise method effectively clones medical imaging models, as validated on Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification tasks.

Conclusion: Medical imaging models are vulnerable to MS attacks, and QueryWise enhances attack efficiency under realistic constraints, highlighting the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of adversarial robustness in neural networks, especially with the release of JPEG AI, necessitates a broader evaluation of NIC robustness beyond limited codecs and attacks.

Method: The paper introduces NIC-RobustBench, a scalable framework with extensive codec support, to evaluate NIC robustness and adversarial defenses while comparing RD performance.

Result: NIC-RobustBench is the first open-source framework of its kind, providing the largest codec library and enabling detailed robustness analysis.

Conclusion: The framework addresses gaps in NIC robustness evaluation, offering a scalable and comprehensive tool for future research.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area
of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models
(LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for
end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating
NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research
has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we
present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate
NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing
Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of
codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper
demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and
employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at

*Zefan Yang,Xinrui Song,Xuanang Xu,Yongyi Shi,Ge Wang,Mannudeep K. Kalra,Pingkun Yan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Xray2Xray is a novel World Model that learns 3D structural information from 2D chest X-rays, improving disease diagnosis and risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D CXRs are limited by structural superposition, reducing diagnostic precision.

Method: Xray2Xray uses a vision model and transition model to capture 3D latent representations from X-ray projections.

Result: Outperformed supervised and self-supervised methods in cardiovascular risk prediction and pathology classification.

Conclusion: Xray2Xray's latent representations enhance diagnostic accuracy and can reconstruct volumetric context.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and
play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images,
CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their
effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the
limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model
that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from
chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume
by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different
angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the
latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease
diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both
supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular
disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying
five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent
representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent
representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates stain variation in H&E-stained tissue images across labs, introduces a multi-center dataset, and evaluates eight normalization methods to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stain variation in H&E-stained tissues hampers pathologists and AI analysis, necessitating computational solutions.

Method: Collected a multi-center dataset with controlled variables, compared eight stain normalization methods (four traditional, four deep learning-based) using quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Result: The dataset highlights inter-lab staining variation, aiding in improving model generalizability.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into stain normalization methods and dataset utility for enhancing AI-based tissue analysis.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for
decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary,
often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both
pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation
computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this
problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein
tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to
66 different labs for routine H&E staining. To isolate staining variation,
other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we
used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different
stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely,
histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep
learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants
each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the
performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation
could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied
training data

### [142] [A Deep Learning Based Method for Fast Registration of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19167)
*Benjamin Graham*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fast, volumetric deep learning model (FLIR) is proposed for cardiac image registration, achieving high fidelity and speed, outperforming patch-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of slow unsupervised deep learning methods in medical image registration, especially for dynamic organs like the heart, while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Proposes a Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) with efficient convolution architecture for fast volumetric registration, applied to quantify cardiac strain.

Result: FLIR achieves registration fidelity comparable to state-of-the-art models but much faster, with consistent strain measurements between acquisitions.

Conclusion: FLIR is a viable fast and accurate solution for cardiac image registration, suitable for research and clinical use.

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

*Xinke Ma,Yongsheng Pan,Qingjie Zeng,Mengkang Lu,Bolysbek Murat Yerzhanuly,Bazargul Matkerim,Yong Xia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EASR-DCN improves deformable medical image registration by representing images with effective ROIs and aligning them independently without labels, outperforming VoxelMorph in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based DMIR methods either ignore ROI representation or rely on labels, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses a Gaussian mixture model for ROI representation and a Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) for independent ROI alignment.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in Dice scores: 10.31% for brain MRI, 13.01% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75% for hippocampus MRI.

Conclusion: EASR-DCN shows superior accuracy and deformation reduction, making it promising for clinical use.

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent
alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable
medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods
have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and
proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods
heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named
EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and
achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels.
Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to
represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process
these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI.
The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a
comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed
on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and
deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our
EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI,
13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its
promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect
inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In
digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for
applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and
biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images,
such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and
repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection
algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over
20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive
experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and
synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments
investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training
epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a
detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a
comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for
digital pathology images.

*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two scalable image compression methods (FR-ICMH and PR-ICMH) for both human and machine vision, improving efficiency and interpretability by integrating residual compression. PR-ICMH achieves 29.57% BD-rate savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable image compression serving both human and machine vision, overcoming limitations of existing neural network-based codecs.

Method: Integrates explicit residual compression (FR-ICMH and PR-ICMH) into the ICMH framework, balancing encoder complexity and performance.

Result: PR-ICMH achieves up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over prior work, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance coding efficiency and flexibility, making them adaptable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs
multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years,
images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image
recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image
compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many
existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image
compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully
designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant
on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently
considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and
interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual
compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding
methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:
Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based
Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various
machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between
encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse
application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over
the previous work.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores explicit alignment methods in mammography for breast cancer risk prediction, comparing input-space vs. representation-space alignment and joint optimization. It finds image-level alignment superior for better deformation fields and risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve breast cancer risk prediction by optimizing explicit alignment methods in mammography, addressing gaps in current approaches.

Method: Compares input-space and representation-space alignment, and joint optimization of alignment and risk prediction, using deformable registration.

Result: Image-level alignment outperforms representation-level alignment, improving deformation field quality and risk prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Joint learning of explicit alignment in representation space trades off alignment quality and predictive performance; image-level alignment is superior.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection.
Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust
screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on
current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of
screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial
alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have
emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and
implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former
providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in
mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into
where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space)
and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We
demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space
while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current
state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and
predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to
representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and
enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at

*Khuram Naveed,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a noise-aware self-attention method (NAADA) to improve fine detail recovery in dental radiographs, outperforming heavier methods like Uformer and MResDNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional DAEs lose high-frequency details in images, especially critical in dental radiographs where fine anatomical structures must be preserved.

Method: Introduces a noise-aware self-attention mechanism to focus on and recover key features in noisy regions, integrated into the NAADA network.

Result: NAADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Uformer, MResDNN) in reconstructing fine details, enhancing image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: The noise-aware self-attention approach effectively addresses the limitation of conventional DAEs, improving detail preservation in dental radiographs.

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

*Zhifeng Wang,Renjiao Yi,Xin Wen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu,Kunlun He*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A self-supervised diffusion model transforms non-angiographic X-rays into angiographic X-rays, addressing data shortages and improving vascular image synthesis quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vascular diseases require detailed imaging, but angiographic X-rays expose patients to high radiation. Non-angiographic X-rays lack paired datasets for deep learning, making synthesis challenging.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model to learn vascular data distribution, a generator for synthesis, and a mask-based adversarial module. Introduces a parametric vascular model for geometric accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and accurately synthesizes blood vessel geometry.

Conclusion: The method provides a pipeline and synthetic dataset, demonstrating superior performance in vascular image synthesis.

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray
angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for
detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose
personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,
which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to
angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by
the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making
high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We
find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and
struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as
disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a
self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic
X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven
approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution
of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a
mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a
parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels.
The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray
angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to
evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves

### [149] [Learning from Anatomy: Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for Improved Metastatic Bone Disease Segmentation in Whole-Body MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19590)
*Joris Wuts,Jakub Ceranka,Nicolas Michoux,Frédéric Lecouvet,Jef Vandemeulebroucke*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for segmenting metastatic bone disease in WB-MRI, outperforming baseline and SSL methods with higher accuracy and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting metastatic bone disease is challenging due to lesion variability, ambiguous boundaries, and class imbalance. Large annotated datasets are hard to obtain, and SSL often fails to capture nuanced features.

Method: Develops SAP using a skeletal segmentation model trained on healthy WB-MRI scans, then compares it to baseline and SSL methods for MBD segmentation in prostate cancer patients.

Result: SAP achieves superior performance (normalized surface Dice of 0.76, Dice coefficient of 0.64, F2 score of 0.44) and 100% sensitivity for lesions >1ml in 28/32 patients.

Conclusion: Learning bone morphology from anatomy provides effective inductive bias for lesion segmentation. SAP is publicly available.

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)
is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations
of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining
reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion
variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,
and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large
unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the
nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method
that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based
skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from
healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its
downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a
state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,
achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The
method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24
(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions
larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32
patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant
inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of
bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

*Klara Leffler,Luigi Tommaso Luppino,Samuel Kuttner,Karin Söderkvist,Jan Axelsson*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning method using a Residual U-Net restores missing sinogram data in sparse PET scanners, enabling cost-effective designs with acceptable image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs of densely packed photodetectors in long axial field-of-view PET scanners limit clinical use. Sparse configurations reduce costs but degrade image quality.

Method: A modified Residual U-Net is trained on clinical PET scans to restore missing sinogram data, simulating 50% detector removal in a chessboard pattern.

Result: The model recovers missing counts with low error, outperforming 2D interpolation, though reconstructed images lose some sharpness.

Conclusion: Sparse PET configurations with deep learning offer a viable, cost-effective alternative to traditional designs, advancing medical imaging.

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and
sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost
is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the
extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost
limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,
allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a
standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we
propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram
data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET
scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in
a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model
successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two
events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and
reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a
smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer
details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial
capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector
configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector
configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable
alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the
development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant
step forward in medical imaging technology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture combining DeepLabV3 and ConvLSTM for prostate gland segmentation in T2-weighted MRI, outperforming 2D and 3D models in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of 2D CNNs (ignoring inter-slice continuity) and 3D models (requiring large annotated datasets) in prostate gland segmentation.

Method: Uses a pretrained DeepLabV3 backbone for slice-wise feature extraction and ConvLSTM layers to integrate information across slices, preserving spatial coherence.

Result: Superior performance on PROMISE12 benchmark, with higher precision, recall, IoU, and DSC, especially in noisy or data-limited conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers robust and accurate segmentation, suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet
challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep
learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most
conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks
(CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their
accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but
require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical
settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that
models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained
DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice
and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate
information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination
enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in
data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the
PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings.
Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection
over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its
potential for robust clinical deployment.

*Zhuowei Xu,Han Li,Dai Sun,Zhicheng Li,Yujia Li,Qingpeng Kong,Zhiwei Cheng,Nassir Navab,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Normalized Hash Encoder and Mapping Consistency Initialization (MCI) to address the local-global training mismatch in NeRF-based CBCT reconstruction, improving stability, convergence, and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT reconstruction suffers from artifacts due to limited X-ray projections. NeRF-based methods face a local-global training mismatch, causing unstable training and degraded results.

Method: Proposes a Normalized Hash Encoder for feature consistency and MCI to initialize the neural network using global mapping from a pre-trained model.

Result: The method improves training stability, accelerates convergence, and enhances reconstruction quality across 128 CT cases from 4 datasets.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, effective, and significantly boosts training efficiency and reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A systematic review of MRI-based segmentation methods for pituitary gland and adenomas highlights deep learning (U-Net) as prevalent but notes variability in performance and lack of key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation is crucial for diagnosing and treating pituitary adenomas, but current methods vary in accuracy and reporting.

Method: Reviewed 34 studies on automatic/semi-automatic segmentation, focusing on techniques (e.g., U-Net) and performance metrics like Dice scores.

Result: Deep learning (U-Net) dominated; Dice scores ranged widely (0.19-96.41%). Semi-automatic methods performed better but lacked key data (e.g., MR field strength).

Conclusion: U-Net shows promise, but improvements and larger datasets are needed for consistent performance, especially in small structures like the pituitary gland.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of
pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation
methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of
pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that
employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and
synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as
Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep
learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent.
Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and
4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported
80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation.
Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field
strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as
U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but
further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in
small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and
larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical
applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) introduces sequential expert communication within layers, improving performance and representational capacity over traditional MoE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the flexibility and diversity of expert combinations in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures by enabling iterative expert selection and communication.

Method: CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts within a layer, using dynamic routing at each step to re-evaluate expert selection.

Result: CoE reduces validation loss (1.20 to 1.12 on math tasks) and offers memory-efficient scaling (17.6-42% reduction) compared to standard MoE.

Conclusion: CoE's iterative routing and residual structure unlock more expressive representations, providing a new scaling axis (depth through iteration) and improved performance.

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

TL;DR: HOLA is an end-to-end framework optimizing LLM deployment for edge devices, combining Hierarchical Speculative Decoding, AdaComp-RAG, and LoBi for speed, accuracy, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High compute and memory demands of LLMs on edge devices hinder real-time applications in healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions like quantization and pruning are partial and often trade off speed or accuracy.

Method: HOLA uses Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for faster inference, AdaComp-RAG for adaptive retrieval complexity, and LoBi (blending LoRA and quantization) for structured pruning.

Result: Achieves 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduces latency and memory on edge devices like Jetson Nano.

Conclusion: HOLA is scalable, production-ready, and addresses the limitations of current LLM deployment solutions on edge devices.

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:
17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge
devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

*Paul C. Bogdan,Uzay Macar,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes sentence-level analysis for understanding reasoning in large language models, introducing three attribution methods to identify influential "thought anchors."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models is hard to interpret due to dependencies between tokens. Sentence-level analysis offers a clearer understanding.

Method: Three attribution methods: (1) black-box counterfactual importance, (2) white-box attention pattern aggregation, and (3) causal attribution via attention suppression.

Result: Identified "thought anchors"—key reasoning steps (e.g., planning or backtracking sentences) that disproportionately influence reasoning.

Conclusion: Sentence-level analysis, supported by consistent findings across methods, enhances interpretability of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

*Puneesh Deora,Bhavya Vasudeva,Tina Behnia,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers in-context learning (ICL) adapts to tasks of varying complexity, favoring simpler explanations when possible, akin to Bayesian Occam's razor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers handle hierarchical task structures and complexity levels in ICL, beyond fixed-complexity environments.

Method: Designed testbeds using Markov chains and linear regression to analyze transformers' ability to infer task complexity and parameters.

Result: Transformers identify appropriate complexity levels and parameters, favoring simpler explanations, aligning with Bayesian principles.

Conclusion: Transformers exhibit an inherent Occam's razor-like bias, balancing fit and complexity, validated even in pretrained models like GPT-4.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP) prevents activation outliers in LLMs, improving quantization performance with minimal training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme activation outliers in LLMs degrade quantization performance, making efficient on-device deployment difficult.

Method: OSP combines the Muon optimizer, Single-Scale RMSNorm, and learnable embedding projection to prevent outlier formation during pre-training.

Result: A 1.4B-parameter OSP model achieves a 35.7 average benchmark score under 4-bit quantization (vs. 26.5 for Adam-trained models) with near-zero excess kurtosis.

Conclusion: Outliers are not inherent to LLMs but result from training strategies; OSP enables more efficient deployment.

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning introduces step-level parallelism to improve speculative decoding (SD), lifting speedup from 1.4x to 2.1x while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level SD's speedup is limited due to exponential drop in correctness for longer token drafts, creating an algorithmic ceiling.

Method: Uses a lightweight draft model to propose future steps, expands them in one batched pass, and verifies semantically correct steps, combining token-level and step-level parallelism.

Result: Achieves higher speedup (2.1x vs. 1.4x) and better scalability with GPU throughput across benchmarks like GSM8K and AIME.

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning effectively raises the algorithmic ceiling of SD, offering improved speed and scalability without compromising quality.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

TL;DR: OFTv2 improves upon OFT by reducing computational costs and memory usage through input-centric reformulation and efficient orthogonal parameterization, achieving faster training and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high runtime and memory demands of OFT limit its practical deployment, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: OFTv2 replaces weight-centric computations with matrix-vector multiplications and introduces the Cayley-Neumann parameterization for efficient orthogonal updates.

Result: OFTv2 achieves up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage while maintaining performance. It also outperforms QLoRA in stability and efficiency for quantized models.

Conclusion: OFTv2 is a more practical and efficient alternative to OFT, with significant improvements in speed, memory usage, and applicability to quantized models.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ConCM, a framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that optimizes feature-structure dual consistency to mitigate knowledge conflict. It introduces memory-aware prototype calibration and dynamic structure matching, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for FSCIL suffer from prototype deviation and structure fixity, limiting embedding space expressiveness. The paper aims to address these issues by ensuring feature and structure consistency.

Method: The ConCM framework includes memory-aware prototype calibration for semantic attribute generalization and dynamic structure matching for adaptive feature alignment.

Result: ConCM outperforms existing methods by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy on mini-ImageNet and CUB200 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses knowledge conflict in FSCIL through dual consistency optimization, achieving superior performance without requiring class-number priors.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

*Yihong Luo,Shuchen Xue,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noise Consistency Training (NCT) is introduced to efficiently integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without retraining, achieving high-quality controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of adapting one-step generators to new control conditions without expensive modifications or retraining.

Method: NCT uses an adapter module and noise consistency loss to align generation behavior with new controls, minimizing distributional distance.

Result: NCT outperforms existing methods in generation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: NCT offers a lightweight, modular, and data-efficient solution for controllable content generation.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

### [163] [Mix-of-Language-Experts Architecture for Multilingual Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18923)
*Yifan Zong,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts) balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual programming by combining a base model, shared LoRA, and language-specific LoRAs, outperforming single-model and separate-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between cost-efficiency and specialization in multilingual programming tasks with LLMs.

Method: Introduces MoLE, a hybrid architecture with a base model, shared LoRA, and language-specific LoRAs, optimized jointly for knowledge sharing and specialization.

Result: MoLE achieves better parameter efficiency and accuracy than single shared or separate language-specific models.

Conclusion: MoLE effectively balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual programming tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

### [164] [LLM-Based Social Simulations Require a Boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19806)
*Zengqing Wu,Run Peng,Takayuki Ito,Chuan Xiao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper advocates for clear boundaries in LLM-based social simulations to enhance their reliability for social science research, addressing alignment, consistency, and robustness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in social simulations, particularly their tendency towards an 'average persona' lacking behavioral heterogeneity, which hinders reliable social pattern discovery.

Method: Examines three boundary problems (alignment, consistency, robustness) and proposes heuristic boundaries and a practical checklist for researchers.

Result: Suggests focusing on collective patterns, real population averages, and robust validation methods to improve LLM-based simulations.

Conclusion: LLM-based simulations can contribute meaningfully to social science if used within defined boundaries, with a focus on collective behaviors and proper validation.

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social
simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to
social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling
human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face
fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern
discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''
that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for
simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:
alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency
(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness
(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for
determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science
understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when
focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)
agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited
variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation
robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in
determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.

### [165] [SOF: Sorted Opacity Fields for Fast Unbounded Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19139)
*Lukas Radl,Felix Windisch,Thomas Deixelberger,Jozef Hladky,Michael Steiner,Dieter Schmalstieg,Markus Steinberger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SOF improves surface reconstruction from 3D Gaussians using hierarchical resorting, robust Gaussian depth, and a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm, achieving higher accuracy and faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for surface extraction from 3D Gaussians suffer from artifacts and limited fidelity due to approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics.

Method: SOF introduces hierarchical resorting, robust Gaussian depth alignment, a level-set regularizer, and geometrically-consistent primitive losses, along with a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm.

Result: SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces processing time by over three times compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: SOF advances Gaussian-based rendering by enabling efficient and precise geometry extraction.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved
the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit
nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting
accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -
remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth
estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and
limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted
Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D
Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work
by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian
depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we
incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and
introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In
addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to
our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.
As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher
reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a
factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient
Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for rendering large 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using virtual memory, reducing memory usage and accelerating rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes efficiently.

Method: Leverages virtual memory and virtual texturing to dynamically stream visible Gaussians to the GPU for real-time rendering, integrating level of detail for optimization.

Result: Reduced memory usage and faster rendering, especially for complex scenes, with practical evaluation on desktop and mobile devices.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances rendering efficiency for large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view
synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly
accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have
drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we
present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes
using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual
texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and
dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering.
Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results
in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for
highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be
integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for
large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key
practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its
impact on desktop and mobile devices.

### [167] [Uncovering Conceptual Blindspots in Generative Image Models Using Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19708)
*Matyas Bohacek,Thomas Fel,Maneesh Agrawala,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to identify 'conceptual blindspots' in generative image models, using sparse autoencoders to compare concept prevalence between real and generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often fail to produce images with simple concepts despite training on large datasets. This work aims to systematically identify and analyze these blindspots.

Method: Leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings, training an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with 32,000 concepts. Applied to four generative models.

Result: Reveals specific suppressed (e.g., bird feeders) and exaggerated (e.g., wood texture) blindspots, along with memorization artifacts.

Conclusion: Proposes a framework for systematically assessing conceptual fidelity in generative models, addressing structural limitations beyond anecdotal observations.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

*Christoph Minixhofer,Ondrej Klejch,Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTSDS2, an improved metric for evaluating TTS systems, validated across domains and languages, and releases resources for synthetic speech evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS evaluation metrics (subjective and objective) are inconsistent, unreliable, or challenged by advanced TTS systems producing near-real speech.

Method: The authors propose TTSDS2, an enhanced version of TTSDS, and validate it against subjective scores. They also provide datasets and benchmarks for robust evaluation.

Result: TTSDS2 outperforms 15 other metrics, consistently correlating well (Spearman >0.50) with subjective scores across domains and languages.

Conclusion: TTSDS2 is a reliable metric for TTS evaluation, supported by released resources for standardized testing.

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAVs to enhance 3D reconstruction quality for static objects, outperforming traditional methods like SfM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturized UAVs face challenges in flight dynamics and power, limiting their autonomy and mission capabilities, especially in indoor or constrained environments.

Method: The authors design and evaluate an N3DR-based pipeline using models like Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, comparing them against SfM using imagery and pointcloud metrics.

Result: The N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves 3D reconstruction quality, enabling high-precision mapping and anomaly detection with small UAVs.

Conclusion: N3DR shows great potential for advancing miniaturized UAV capabilities, particularly in constrained environments.

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional keyword-based search engines are inadequate for complex, multi-step information needs, necessitating a more advanced approach.

Method: The method involves LLMs with reasoning and agentic capabilities, forming a dynamic feedback loop of autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis. A test-time scaling law is introduced to quantify computational depth's impact.

Result: Agentic Deep Research significantly outperforms existing approaches, supported by benchmark results and open-source implementations.

Conclusion: Agentic Deep Research is poised to become the dominant paradigm for future information seeking, with resources available for community use.

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the dual challenge of high accuracy and efficiency in e-commerce IR systems for complex queries and large catalogs.

Method: Proposes NEAR², using nested embeddings for retrieval and ranking, validated with multiple loss functions on diverse test sets.

Result: Achieves 12x efficiency in embedding size, no extra training cost, and improved accuracy over smaller dimensions.

Conclusion: NEAR² effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in e-commerce IR, outperforming existing models.

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve controversies about AF organization in nonhuman primates and understand how its anatomy differs from humans, potentially explaining human language specialization.

Method: Combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing (viral-based labeling and fluorescence tomography) in macaques with 11.7T diffusion MRI, and spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans for comparative connectomics.

Result: Macaque AF originates in temporal-parietal cortex, while human AF shows expanded middle temporal gyrus connectivity and stronger frontoparietal linkages, quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis.

Conclusion: Interspecies differences in AF connectivity likely underpin human language evolution and provide a framework for understanding AF-related disorders like aphasia and dyslexia.

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman
primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges
from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing -
using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning
tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain
tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding
analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis
of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the
temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum,
and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits
greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and
parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler
analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language
networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader
temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a
connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing
unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework
for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where
aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

Motivation: To improve the generation of high-quality audio synchronized with video content by leveraging multimodal interactions and enhancing alignment capabilities.

Method: Uses multimodal diffusion transformers, visual semantic representation, and audio-visual synchronization modules. Introduces a universal latent audio codec and stereo rendering.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment, and audio quality.

Conclusion: Kling-Foley effectively synthesizes video-matching audio and sets a new benchmark for multimodal audio generation.

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

Motivation: The lack of a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS) motivates this study.

Result: Provides empirical comparisons and actionable insights into utility-privacy tradeoffs, answering key questions about synthetic data's effectiveness and optimal release strategies.

Conclusion: The study guides decisions on data release strategies by evaluating diverse methods, highlighting the balance between utility and privacy in PPDS.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image
generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field
lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation
methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic
images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of
generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and
outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically
categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations
along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare
diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative
generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs)
as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical
questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which
release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the
utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different
scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides
actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data
generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies

Motivation: To improve robotic scene understanding by evaluating how well vision-language models (VLMs) generate descriptions of tabletop scenes from multiple viewpoints.

Method: The robot captures images of objects from various viewpoints, and multiple captioning models (e.g., BLIP, VLMs) are evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of descriptions.

Result: VLMs are effective for recognizing common objects but fail to generalize to novel representations like 3D printed objects. Multi-view captioning outperforms single-view.

Conclusion: VLMs are practical for robotic settings with common objects but need improvements for novel representations. The study offers insights for deploying foundation models in real-world embodied agents.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

TL;DR: CronusVLA extends single-frame VLA models to multi-frame observation efficiently, improving performance and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are limited by single-frame observations, missing motion information from multi-frame data due to high computational costs.

Method: CronusVLA uses single-frame pretraining, multi-frame encoding, and cross-frame decoding to efficiently aggregate motion features and predict actions.

Result: Achieves 70.9% success rate on SimplerEnv and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO, with strong real-world performance.

Conclusion: CronusVLA effectively leverages multi-frame data for better performance and efficiency, demonstrating robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across
manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame
observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information
offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large
vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and
inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends
single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient
post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame
pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens
prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)
multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from
discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating
motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame
decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared
decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and
caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an
application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation
mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during
finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with
70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world

Abstract: In Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments such as
indoor parking structures or dense urban canyons, achieving accurate and robust
vehicle positioning remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a
cost-effective, vision-based multi-sensor navigation system that integrates
monocular depth estimation, semantic filtering, and visual map registration
(VMR) with 3-D digital maps. Extensive testing in real-world indoor and outdoor
driving scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system,
achieving sub-meter accuracy of 92% indoors and more than 80% outdoors, with
consistent horizontal positioning and heading average root mean-square errors
of approximately 0.98 m and 1.25 {\deg}, respectively. Compared to the
baselines examined, the proposed solution significantly reduced drift and
improved robustness under various conditions, achieving positioning accuracy
improvements of approximately 88% on average. This work highlights the
potential of cost-effective monocular vision systems combined with 3D maps for
scalable, GNSS-independent navigation in land vehicles.
