Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted\nAggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into\nthe aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model\nwhile significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse\nActivation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during\nthe aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from\nthe update process.

Given a time-varying sequence of persistence\ndiagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar\nfields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at \"inverting\"\nthe non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the\ncorresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which\nlearns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based\non the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the\nnon-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific\ntopological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical\nand topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,\ngiven an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach\ninstantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input\nthrough the network.

While recent self-supervised learning\nmethods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the\ncharacteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works\nconcentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths\noffered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust\ntraversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a\nmultimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and\nestimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and\ncamera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability\nlabels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging\nthese labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different\nmodalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse\ntraversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based\nsupervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,\nextensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
