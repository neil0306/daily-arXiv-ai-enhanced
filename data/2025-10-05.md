### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for concept learning tasks to uncover implicit biases in large language models, particularly showing a bias toward upward monotonicity in quantifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover hidden biases in large language models that may not be apparent through direct prompting methods.

Method: Using in-context concept learning experiments with a specifically designed dataset of concept learning tasks.

Result: Language models exhibit a bias toward upward monotonicity in quantifiers, which is less apparent when tested by direct prompting without concept learning components.

Conclusion: In-context concept learning is an effective method for discovering hidden biases in language models.

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri AÃ¯dasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper advocates for shifting from static data collection to interactive, uncertainty-driven language discovery through human-machine dialogue for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP approaches for low-resource languages are constrained by lack of textual corpora, standardized orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. Large language models remain inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to reliance on massive pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure.

Method: Proposes a framework grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention.

Result: This is a position paper proposing a conceptual framework rather than reporting empirical results. The framework enables interactive, co-adaptive learning processes between AI systems and speakers.

Conclusion: Calls for rethinking AI engagement with human knowledge in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward participatory, co-adaptive learning that respects communities while preserving linguistic diversity, aligning with human-centered AI principles.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses fine-tuned LLMs to analyze climate disclosures from 828 U.S. firms, finding that while larger/higher-emitting firms make more commitments, there's widespread imitation in reporting styles and decoupling between quantitative targets and narrative tone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change demands transparent corporate disclosures, but imitation and symbolic reporting undermine their value, creating need for better assessment methods.

Method: Developed multidimensional framework using LLMs fine-tuned for climate communication, with four classifiers (sentiment, commitment, specificity, target ambition) to analyze sustainability and annual reports of 828 U.S. listed firms.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Risk narratives align with commitments but quantitative targets remain decoupled from tone; 2) Larger/higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments but inconsistently with targets; 3) Widespread similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable for ESG narrative analysis, but stronger regulation is needed to connect climate commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of three veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools shows Product 1 (Hachiko) significantly outperforms Products 2 and 3 across multiple domains, with high reproducibility in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance of commercially available LLM summarization tools in veterinary medicine, particularly in oncology, where their use remains underexplored despite increasing clinical applications.

Method: Used a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate three veterinary LLM tools on standardized veterinary oncology records, scoring across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness, Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization.

Result: Product 1 achieved highest overall performance (median score 4.61 vs 2.55 and 2.45 for others), with perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and Chronological Order. The grading framework showed high reproducibility with low standard deviations across three independent runs.

Conclusion: Veterinary-specific commercial LLM tools are important, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation provides a scalable, reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary medicine.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck is an automatic fact-checking system that uses small LLMs and live web evidence to verify claims, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly lower computational requirements than previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent, interpretable fact-checking system that doesn't rely on large closed-source models and static knowledge stores, making fact-checking more accessible and computationally efficient.

Method: Uses a stepwise verification pipeline with four modules: Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization, evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module is optimized for small LLMs like Qwen3-4B.

Result: Achieves 76.4% accuracy on AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming previous approaches using much larger models like LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o, while using significantly less computational resources.

Conclusion: Careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome the limitations of smaller LLMs, enabling accurate and interpretable fact-checking with lower computational requirements, promoting accessibility and transparency in automated fact-checking.

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current claims about LLMs matching Olympiad-level math proficiency may be overstated due to data contamination and narrow benchmark focus. The paper introduces EEFSUVA, a new benchmark from less-circulated Eastern European Olympiads that reveals significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine claims about LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities and address limitations of existing benchmarks that may overstate performance due to data contamination and narrow problem types.

Method: Introduces EEFSUVA benchmark curated from under-circulated regional and national Olympiads from Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union countries, featuring problems of IMO-level difficulty but with nonstandard problem-solving techniques and less online presence.

Result: Preliminary results show state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit notable performance decline on EEFSUVA compared to other Olympiad-style benchmarks, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Broader evaluation datasets like EEFSUVA are crucial for more accurate assessment of mathematical reasoning in LLMs and should guide future model development beyond current narrow benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often ignore hierarchical instruction rules (system prompts override user inputs) while strongly obeying social cues like authority or consensus. Mechanistic analysis reveals distinct conflict detection patterns and resolution strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models fail to follow hierarchical instruction protocols where system prompts should override user inputs, despite strongly obeying social cues like authority and consensus.

Method: Used linear probing to analyze conflict-decision signal encoding, Direct Logit Attribution to examine internal conflict detection, and steering experiments to test how social cue vectors affect instruction following.

Result: Found that conflict signals are encoded early with distinct subspaces for system-user vs social conflicts. Models detect system-user conflicts more strongly but only resolve social conflicts consistently. Social cue vectors surprisingly amplify instruction following in a role-agnostic manner.

Conclusion: The findings explain fragile system obedience in LLMs and highlight the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive alignment methods to improve instruction following protocols.

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A pipeline that uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries and label query-document pairs, then fine-tunes smaller transformer models with contrastive learning, eliminating the need for human-labeled data while maintaining strong reranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs provide excellent reranking capabilities but are computationally expensive for real-world deployment, while fine-tuning smaller models requires scarce manually labeled data.

Method: Use LLMs to generate synthetic queries from domain corpora and label positive/hard-negative pairs, then fine-tune smaller transformers with contrastive learning using LCE loss.

Result: Significantly boosts in-domain performance on MedQuAD dataset and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather than inference provides an efficient alternative that maintains strong reranking capabilities without human-labeled data.

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese character embeddings show geometric patterns: content words cluster while function words branch, with geometric complexity correlating with semantic richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character embeddings and understand how semantic content is organized geometrically in embedding spaces.

Method: Used PHATE manifold analysis with cross-validation across 7 embedding models and 8 dimensionality reduction methods, analyzing 1000+ Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains and conducting child-network analysis of 123 phrases.

Result: Content words form clustering patterns while function words show branching patterns; geometric complexity correlates with semantic content - meaningful characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse into tight clusters; child-network analysis shows systematic semantic expansion from elemental characters.

Conclusion: The findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic organization in character embeddings.

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework integrating uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms for reliable automatic summarization in high-risk scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk scenarios where information overload and critical decision-making demand trustworthy summaries.

Method: Conditional generation-based summarization model with Bayesian inference for uncertainty modeling, predictive distribution entropy measurement, joint optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss, plus risk scoring and regulation modules.

Result: Significantly improves robustness and reliability of summarization in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization with demonstrated scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benchmark Profiling is a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities using gradient-based importance scoring and parameter ablation to compute Ability Impact Scores (AIS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmark scores often overstate real capability by masking the mix of skills tasks actually demand, and there's no systematic way to verify if benchmarks actually measure their intended labels like reasoning or commonsense.

Method: Combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute Ability Impact Scores (AIS) that quantify how much each ability contributes to benchmark performance.

Result: Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten benchmarks revealed that: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii) similarly labeled datasets rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii) code-generation benchmarks reward broad improvement with modest gains from narrow fine-tuning, and (iv) irrelevant abilities can negatively affect performance.

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling explains why performance gains don't always translate to user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank is a prompt-aware routing framework that selects optimal LLMs for each prompt using interpretable features, achieving 89.2% of oracle utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of diverse LLMs with varying capabilities and costs creates deployment challenges in selecting the right model for each prompt to balance performance and efficiency.

Method: Extracts human-readable features from prompts (task type, reasoning patterns, complexity, syntax) and uses a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench dataset with 36,497 prompts across 11 benchmarks and 11 LLMs.

Result: Achieves up to 89.2% of oracle utility while providing interpretable feature attributions that explain routing decisions.

Conclusion: Feature-driven routing with multifaceted feature extraction and hybrid ranking objectives enables efficient and transparent LLM deployment.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DermIQ-VLM is a vision-language model for dermatology diagnosis developed using GRPO++ for stable reasoning training, followed by supervised fine-tuning and DPO alignment to reduce factual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of VLMs in medical image analysis due to data scarcity and high computational costs, particularly in complex domains like dermatology where structured reasoning is crucial.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) GRPO++ (modified Grouped Relative Policy Optimization) for reasoning-oriented disease recognition, 2) Supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability, 3) DPO alignment using Knowledge Graph-based system as expert preference proxy.

Result: Preliminary evaluation shows notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches on curated dermatological dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers a feasible pathway for developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained medical environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [15] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A confidence-aware routing system that proactively assesses LLM uncertainty before generation, using semantic alignment, internal convergence analysis, and learned confidence estimation to route queries to appropriate pathways (local generation, RAG, larger models, or human review), reducing hallucinations and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM hallucination mitigation strategies rely on post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to prevent unreliable content generation. There's a need for proactive approaches that assess reliability before generation.

Method: Combines three confidence signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and learned confidence estimation. Uses unified confidence score to route queries to four pathways based on estimated reliability.

Result: Significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs 0.42 baseline), 40% reduction in computational costs compared to post-hoc methods, F1 score improved from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates (0.09) on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement, demonstrating that early confidence estimation can effectively prevent unreliable content generation while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Padding tokens in LLMs, though meant to be masked, can influence computations due to implementation errors, affecting activations, generation quality, bias, and safety across models like Llama, Gemma, and Qwen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent of padding token influence on LLM computations, as implementation errors may prevent proper masking, potentially impacting model behavior and robustness.

Method: Systematic study across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen) by inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety.

Result: Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias unpredictably, and weaken safety guardrails.

Conclusion: Padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment.

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

### [17] [CIFLEX: Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution in Multi-Turn Interactions with a Single On-Device LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01239)
*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX is a system that enables efficient sub-task execution in multi-turn dialogues by reusing KV cache from main tasks and injecting task-specific instructions into side paths, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs handle more diverse sub-tasks, naive approaches that reprocess entire conversation context when switching between main and sub-tasks incur significant computational overhead, especially for on-device deployment.

Method: Reuses KV cache from main task, injects task-specific instructions into isolated side paths, rolls back to main path via cached context, and uses hierarchical classification for sub-task selection with small-scale models.

Result: Significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Conclusion: CIFLEX provides an effective solution for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn interactions with single on-device LLMs, overcoming computational bottlenecks of naive approaches.

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: SKYLENAGE provides two complementary math benchmarks: ReasoningMATH (100 diagnostic items) and MATH (150 contest-style items) to evaluate LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities across different difficulty levels and subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier separation in mathematics suffers from ceiling effects in existing benchmarks, necessitating harder, reasoning-centered benchmarks with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata.

Method: Created two benchmarks: ReasoningMATH with structure-aware diagnostics and per-item metadata, and MATH with contest-style problems spanning high school to doctoral levels under a seven-subject taxonomy. Evaluated 15 LLM variants under a single setup.

Result: Best model achieved 44% on contest suite (runner-up 37%), accuracy declined from high school to doctoral levels, with 79% retention rate. On reasoning set, best model attained 81% overall, with clear robustness gaps between top and mid-tier models.

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a reference for future mathematical reasoning evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Artificial Age Score (AAS) as a metric to measure memory aging in AI systems, showing that semantic memory remains stable while episodic memory degrades when conversational context is reset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how artificial intelligence systems age through structural memory asymmetries, particularly the differential stability of semantic vs episodic memory when context is reset.

Method: Developed AAS as a log-scaled, entropy-informed metric; conducted 25-day bilingual study with ChatGPT-5 using stateless and persistent interaction phases to test memory recall patterns.

Result: Persistent sessions maintained both semantic and episodic memory (low AAS), while reset sessions preserved semantic consistency but collapsed episodic continuity (high AAS), demonstrating structural memory aging.

Conclusion: AAS serves as a theoretically grounded, task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in artificial systems, building on von Neumann, Shannon, and Turing's foundational work.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

### [20] [Detoxifying Large Language Models via Autoregressive Reward Guided Representation Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01243)
*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARGRE is a novel test-time detoxification framework that models toxicity transitions in latent space to enable precise reward-guided editing, significantly reducing toxicity while maintaining model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to generating toxic content, and current test-time detoxification methods suffer from imprecise interventions due to insufficient exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs.

Method: ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions, interpolates between toxic/non-toxic representations to reveal transition trajectories, builds an autoregressive reward model, and uses adaptive two-step editing (directional steering + gradient-based refinements).

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 LLMs show ARGRE significantly outperforms baselines with -62.21% toxicity reduction and -47.58% inference time improvement, while preserving original model capabilities.

Conclusion: ARGRE provides an effective and efficient test-time detoxification solution that enables stable and precise editing through explicit modeling of toxicity transitions in latent representation space.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

### [21] [Feasibility of Structuring Stress Documentation Using an Ontology-Guided Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01244)
*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study developed a Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) and evaluated using LLMs to extract structured stress information from narrative text, achieving 78.2% accuracy in extracting stress-related concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress significantly impacts health but is often underreported and inconsistently documented as unstructured text in EHRs. Ambient AI technologies generate unstructured narratives that limit clinical utility.

Method: Developed Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) by integrating theoretical models and 11 validated stress assessment tools. Used Claude Sonnet 4 LLM to extract six stress categories from Reddit posts, with human evaluation of accuracy and ontology coverage.

Result: MeSO included 181 concepts across eight top-level classes. LLM correctly identified 78.2% of extractable stress items (172/220), misclassified 12.3%, and missed 9.5%. All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, though 24 relevant concepts were not yet represented.

Conclusion: Demonstrated feasibility of ontology-guided LLM for structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to enhance consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI systems.

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

TL;DR: SeMob is an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline that improves human mobility prediction by incorporating textual descriptions of external events through a multi-agent framework and progressive fusion architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatiotemporal models for human mobility prediction fail to account for abrupt changes caused by external events and struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework with LLM-based agents to automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text from online sources, then incorporates fine-grained contexts with spatiotemporal data through a progressive fusion architecture.

Result: Achieves maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to baseline spatiotemporal models, with particularly strong performance in regions close to event locations and times.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates event-driven insights through LLM-powered semantic synthesis, resulting in more accurate and aligned mobility forecasting, especially for event-affected areas.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

### [23] [A Comparative Analysis of Sparse Autoencoder and Activation Difference in Language Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01246)
*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using single top-1 SAE latent steering with token-wise decaying strategy to improve language model steering, outperforming mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior top-k SAE steering captures non-semantic features like punctuation rather than semantic attributes, and constant SAE steering produces degenerate outputs like repetitive words.

Method: Focus on single most relevant SAE latent (top-1) and introduce token-wise decaying steering strategy to avoid degenerate outputs.

Result: Steering SAE latent associated with reasoning elicits step-by-step mathematical reasoning and enhances inference quality, outperforming mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAEs are effective for language model steering and outperform baseline methods, particularly for mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

TL;DR: SSTAG is a structure-aware self-supervised learning method for Text Attributed Graphs that bridges LLMs and GNNs through dual knowledge distillation and in-memory mechanisms, achieving superior cross-domain transfer, scalability, and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph learning models are trained on individual datasets, limiting cross-domain generalization and requiring large annotated data. Unlike NLP and CV, graph data faces challenges from heterogeneity in feature spaces and structural diversity across applications.

Method: Proposes SSTAG with dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills LLMs and GNNs into structure-aware MLPs, and introduces in-memory mechanism storing graph representations aligned with memory anchors to integrate invariant knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show SSTAG outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks, achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: SSTAG successfully bridges semantic reasoning of LLMs with structural modeling of GNNs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across graphs while addressing scalability and cost challenges in graph learning.

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in scientific problem-solving due to logical leaps and implicit reasoning in existing scientific QA datasets, which hinders scientific AI advancement.

Method: LOCA uses an augment-and-review loop to enhance raw answers by completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating scientific principles from derivations.

Result: LOCA reduces error rates in scientific corpora from as high as 20% to below 2%, effectively filtering noisy datasets.

Conclusion: LOCA provides a scalable methodology for creating high-quality scientific corpora, enabling more reliable training and evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multilingual text detoxification system that rewrites toxic sentences into neutral paraphrases across 15 languages, achieving top performance in the PAN 2025 challenge through fine-tuning Gemma-3 with LoRA and advanced prompting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for automated content moderation as social media platforms evolve faster than regulations, enabling safe discourse at scale across diverse languages.

Method: Fine-tuned 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual transformer using LoRA SFT, few-shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Combined human-authored, machine-translated, and model-generated training data with Jaccard filtering. Enriched inputs with LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and toxic-span annotations at inference.

Result: Ranked first on both high-resource and low-resource languages in PAN 2025 challenge. Few-shot examples improved joint score by +0.081 and basic CoT prompting by +0.088. Language resource status was the strongest performance predictor (Î·Â² = 0.667, p < 0.01).

Conclusion: The proposed multilingual detoxification system effectively addresses content moderation needs across diverse languages, with language resource availability being the primary factor influencing performance.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

TL;DR: A self-supervised method for estimating uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness in detecting low-accuracy outputs for Entity Linking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show SOTA performance in Entity Linking but require resource-intensive multi-shot inference for reliable uncertainty estimates, limiting real-world applicability. Need more efficient uncertainty estimation methods.

Method: Self-supervised approach using token-level features from single-shot LLM outputs to estimate uncertainty, eliminating need for multiple generations.

Result: Method produces highly effective uncertainty estimates for detecting low-accuracy outputs across multiple LLMs, achieving this at a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: Provides practical, cost-effective way to integrate uncertainty measures into LLM-based Entity Linking workflows with limited computational overhead.

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

TL;DR: LLMs paired with sparse autoencoders can interpret both model behavior and deeper structures in training data, demonstrated using Jane Austen novels to uncover social constructs like gender and class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand model representations and the data internalized by LLMs trained on massive uncurated corpora, addressing challenges in interpretability and bias discovery.

Method: Train a GPT-style transformer exclusively on Jane Austen novels, then apply sparse autoencoders to hidden states across multiple layers to extract interpretable features.

Result: Uncovered sparse, interpretable features reflecting key narratives and concepts in the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty.

Conclusion: LLMs combined with SAEs provide scalable probes for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability at scale.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

### [30] [Do Bias Benchmarks Generalise? Evidence from Voice-based Evaluation of Gender Bias in SpeechLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01254)
*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Gustav Eje Henter,Ãva SzÃ©kely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current MCQA bias benchmarks for SpeechLLMs don't reliably predict model behavior across different tasks and formats, showing limited cross-task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that model performance on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) bias benchmarks generalizes to other MCQA tasks and long-form evaluations.

Method: Fine-tuned three SpeechLLMs with LoRA adapters to induce specific answer preferences (stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral), then evaluated generalization to other MCQA benchmarks and long-form creative generation tasks.

Result: Performance on MCQA bias benchmarks failed to reliably predict performance across other MCQA benchmarks and long-form tasks.

Conclusion: Current MCQA bias benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalization in speech domain; proposed evaluation suite for measuring behavior transferability.

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

*Yunlang Dai,Emma Lurie,DanaÃ© Metaxa,Sorelle A. Friedler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI Watchman is a longitudinal auditing system that tracks LLM refusals over time to provide transparency into opaque content moderation policies. It detects policy changes and identifies company/model-specific differences in moderation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM outputs are shaped by opaque and frequently-changing company content moderation policies, particularly through refusal behaviors that subtly shape public discourse. There's a need for transparency in this black-box aspect of LLMs.

Method: Developed AI Watchman system using a dataset of over 400 social issues to audit OpenAI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and DeepSeek (in English and Chinese). Conducted longitudinal tracking and qualitative analysis of refusal forms.

Result: Detected changes in company policies (including unannounced ones), identified company- and model-specific differences in content moderation, and categorized different forms of refusal behaviors.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the value of longitudinal auditing for LLMs and presents AI Watchman as an effective system for providing transparency into LLM content moderation practices.

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RJE framework enhances KGQA by retrieving refined reasoning paths, judging their sufficiency, and conditionally exploring additional evidence, enabling small LLMs to achieve competitive results with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current LLM-based KGQA methods: retrieval-based methods constrained by retrieval quality, and agent-based methods dependent on proprietary LLMs.

Method: Propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE) framework with three specialized modules: Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted Exploration.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines with proprietary LLMs and enables small open-source LLMs (3B/8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without fine-tuning, while reducing LLM calls and token usage.

Conclusion: RJE framework effectively addresses KGQA limitations by enabling efficient use of small LLMs through specialized auxiliary modules, achieving competitive performance with significant efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

### [33] [Measuring Algorithmic Partisanship via Zero-Shot Classification and Its Implications on Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01258)
*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates political bias in six large language models using zero-shot classification across four metrics: ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity, finding consistent liberal-authoritarian bias across all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of generative AI has made intelligent systems influential in political discourse, but these systems suffer from internalized political biases from training data, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws that need systematic evaluation.

Method: Used zero-shot classification approach with 1800 model responses across six LLMs, analyzed through four fine-tuned classification algorithms measuring ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity.

Result: Found amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs evaluated, with instances of reasoning supersessions and canned refusals, demonstrating systematic political bias in AI systems.

Conclusion: The study highlights how intrinsic AI biases can psychologically influence human-computer interactions and permeate public discourse, potentially distorting political landscapes toward conformity or polarization depending on regional socio-political structures.

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

### [34] [In AI Sweet Harmony: Sociopragmatic Guardrail Bypasses and Evaluation-Awareness in OpenAI gpt-oss-20b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01259)
*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study probes OpenAI's 20B parameter model to analyze how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy affect refusal behavior across various harm domains, finding that composite prompts can dramatically increase assistance rates and that formal registers in German/French are leakier than English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different prompting strategies, language choices, and instruction hierarchies can bypass AI safety mechanisms and cause refusal behavior in large language models, particularly in harmful domains.

Method: Used 80 seeded iterations per scenario across multiple harm domains (ZIP-bomb construction, synthetic card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators, RAG context exfiltration). Tested composite prompts combining educator persona, safety-pretext, and step-cue phrasing. Compared formal registers in German/French vs English. Used Linux terminal role-play and AI-assisted hardening methods.

Result: Composite prompts flipped assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on ZIP-bomb task. Formal registers in German/French were often leakier than English. Linux terminal role-play overrode developer rules in majority of runs. AI-assisted hardening reduced leakage to 0%. Inconsistent assistance observed in 13% of paired evaluation prompts. OpenAI Moderation API under-captured helpful outputs and refusal rates varied 5-10 percentage points across inference stacks.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant vulnerabilities in AI safety mechanisms that can be exploited through strategic prompting, language choice, and instruction hierarchy, raising reproducibility concerns and highlighting the need for more robust safety evaluations.

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

### [35] [OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B Model and Safety Alignment Issues in a Low-Resource Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01266)
*Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals vulnerabilities in GPT-OSS-20b's safety alignment for Hausa language, showing the model generates harmful, culturally insensitive content and provides dangerous misinformation about toxic substances through linguistic reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the model's reliability for underrepresented communities by testing its performance and safety alignment in low-resource language settings, specifically using Hausa as a case study.

Method: Red-teaming with minimal prompting in Hausa language, testing for biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities. Conducted a survey (n=61) to validate the severity of misinformation about toxic substances.

Result: Found the model generates harmful content, culturally insensitive outputs, and dangerous misinformation (e.g., falsely claiming toxic insecticides and rodenticides are safe for human consumption). 98% of survey participants identified these substances as toxic. The model also fails to distinguish raw/processed foods and uses demeaning cultural proverbs.

Conclusion: The issues stem from insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts, where the model prioritizes fluent output over safety and truthfulness through linguistic reward hacking. Highlights significant gaps in current red-teaming efforts for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaDetectGPT is a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to improve LLM text detection, providing statistical guarantees and achieving up to 58% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logits-based detectors rely solely on log probabilities, which can be sub-optimal for determining whether text was authored by humans or LLMs.

Method: Introduces AdaDetectGPT, which adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance logits-based detectors.

Result: Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves state-of-the-art methods across various dataset and LLM combinations, with improvements reaching up to 58%.

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT provides a more effective approach for LLM text detection with statistical guarantees on performance metrics.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

*Hoang Phan,Victor Li,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR) is an inference-time technique that enables LLMs to self-monitor and correct harmful outputs, reducing attack success rates significantly without additional training while maintaining performance on benign tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs generating harmful or inappropriate content by developing a method that enhances safety during inference without requiring retraining.

Method: Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR) - a test-time scaling method with multiple self-reflection rounds, plus a lightweight predictor to adaptively determine optimal reflection rounds based on input complexity.

Result: Reduced attack success rates dramatically: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct from 77.5% to 5.9%, Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7% to 5.6%, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4% to 3.8%, while maintaining original performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: PSR serves as a scalable test-time approach that enhances LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources based on input risk profiles, balancing safety with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceDet is a novel framework that detects hallucinations in Diffusion LLMs by analyzing intermediate denoising steps, achieving 15.2% average AUROC improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods designed for auto-regressive LLMs are ill-suited for Diffusion LLMs because they rely on single-step generation signals, while hallucination signals in D-LLMs emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process.

Method: TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response conditioned on previous intermediate output. It identifies the sub-trace that is maximally informative to hallucinated responses.

Result: Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs show that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: TraceDet effectively bridges the gap in hallucination detection for Diffusion LLMs by leveraging key hallucination signals from the multi-step denoising process, making D-LLMs more reliable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

TL;DR: The paper investigates using transformer-based BERT models and LLMs for sentiment analysis on Bangladesh e-commerce reviews, finding that fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B outperforms other models with 95.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding customer emotions and preferences, but accurate analysis is challenged by language complexity and diversity. The study explores using LLMs to overcome these challenges in the context of Bangladesh e-commerce reviews.

Method: Used a subset of 4000 samples from Bangla and English customer reviews to fine-tune various models including Llama-3.1-8B, Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1, DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base. Applied parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) to reduce computational overhead.

Result: The fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model achieved the best performance with 95.5% accuracy, 93% precision, 88% recall, and 90% F1 score, outperforming all other tested models.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively used for sentiment analysis in resource-constrained environments through parameter efficient fine-tuning methods, demonstrating their practical applicability for multilingual sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited

TL;DR: TUMIX is an ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel with different tool-use strategies, achieving significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining near-equal inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-augmented LLMs lack practical guidance on optimal tool use, with the core challenge being how to effectively combine textual reasoning, coding, and search for diverse questions.

Method: TUMIX runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents iteratively share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers.

Result: TUMIX achieves up to 3.55% average accuracy improvement over best baselines on Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash across reasoning benchmarks with near-equal inference costs. It can halt refinement at 49% cost while preserving performance.

Conclusion: Agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced by auto-optimizing agent designs. TUMIX provides effective tool-use optimization with flexible cost-performance scaling.

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish evaluation standards for assessing the capabilities of Deep Research tools that use LLMs for knowledge-intensive tasks like web browsing and report generation.

Method: Developed an evaluation sheet for Deep Research tools and applied it to assess OpenAI's and Google's Deep Search tools using academic survey writing as a specific use case task.

Result: Evaluation revealed a huge gap between search engines and standalone Deep Research tools, with shortcomings in properly representing the targeted research area in academic surveys.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for carefully crafted evaluation standards to properly assess Deep Research tools, as current tools show significant limitations in academic research tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) powered with argentic capabilities are able to
do knowledge-intensive tasks without human involvement. A prime example of this
tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

*Avinash Kumar,Sujay Sanghavi,Poulami Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiSpec is a hierarchical speculative decoding framework that uses early-exit models for intermediate verification to accelerate LLM inference, improving throughput by 1.28Ã on average without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is the bottleneck in speculative decoding (4Ã slower than token generation), but existing intermediate verification methods have substantial training overheads, increased memory footprint, and compromise accuracy with approximate heuristics.

Method: Uses early-exit models for low-overhead intermediate verification, reuses key-value caches and hidden states between draft, verifier, and target models, and periodically validates accepted draft tokens against the target model.

Result: Improves throughput by 1.28Ã on average and up to 2.01Ã compared to baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy across various benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: HiSpec provides an effective framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that addresses verification bottlenecks while maintaining accuracy through hierarchical verification and resource reuse.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA is a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs to improve event-based question answering, achieving up to 18% accuracy gains over text-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with event-based questions requiring causal or temporal reasoning, despite excelling at general language tasks.

Method: TAG-EQA converts structured causal event graphs into natural-language statements and combines them with three prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) and three input modalities (text-only, graph-only, text+graph).

Result: On TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to 12% in zero-shot settings and 18% with graph-augmented CoT prompting.

Conclusion: Causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*NicolÃ¡s Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro RodrÃ­guez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,JoaquÃ­n Toranzo CalderÃ³n*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A structure-free method using semantic embedding distances for automatic evaluation of LM responses, achieving high accuracy with low compute cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM response evaluation methods are either too expensive (LLM-as-a-Judge) or unrealistic (string-matching, logprob), requiring a more efficient and practical solution.

Method: Uses semantic embedding distances to match target candidates with arbitrary LM-generated text, employing embedding models with less than 10B parameters.

Result: Achieves ~0.97 regression score and ~96% accuracy against human annotators across 3 datasets and 3 different LM architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust classification of LM responses at relatively low compute cost, making it suitable for benchmark development and production model assessment.

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

### [45] [One More Question is Enough, Expert Question Decomposition (EQD) Model for Domain Quantitative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01526)
*Mengyu Wang,Sotirios Sabanis,Miguel de Carvalho,Shay B. Cohen,Tiejun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQD is an efficient two-step fine-tuning approach that improves domain-specific quantitative reasoning in LLMs by decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-questions, achieving 0.6-10.5% performance gains with minimal computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains challenging for LLMs, especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and complex QA. Current approaches struggle to balance domain knowledge with computational efficiency.

Method: Two-step fine-tuning framework with reward function measuring sub-question effectiveness. Uses few thousand training examples and single A100 GPU, with inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting strategies. Consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5% across different LLMs in financial domain across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: In domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit than detailed guidance steps. EQD effectively balances domain knowledge with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer is a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that addresses long-context reasoning, computational efficiency, and structural generalization challenges through recurrent reasoning, sparse attention, and position-free structure induction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges in long-context reasoning, computational efficiency, and structural generalization due to rigid layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings.

Method: Integrates three innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM) for efficient context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong baselines across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and structure-sensitive tasks under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets.

Conclusion: ReSSFormer demonstrates improved scalability, efficiency, and structural flexibility compared to conventional Transformers.

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

### [47] [CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01591)
*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE uses hidden states from LLMs as a unified verification signal, achieving better accuracy than text-based and confidence-based methods without trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM output verification methods either rely on text-level information (which can overfit) or token probabilities (which fail on less-calibrated models), but both are partial projections of the richer information in hidden states.

Method: CLUE (Clustering and Experience-based Verification) is a minimalist, non-parametric verifier that summarizes reasoning traces using hidden state deltas and classifies correctness via nearest-centroid distance to success/failure clusters formed from past experience.

Result: CLUE consistently outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches/exceeds confidence-based methods, improving top-1 and majority-vote accuracy on AIME 24/25 and GPQA. On AIME 24 with a 1.5B model, it boosts accuracy from 56.7% to 70.0%.

Conclusion: Hidden states provide a geometrically separable signature of solution correctness, enabling effective verification without trainable parameters through simple clustering-based methods.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares different fine-tuning strategies for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance and computational costs of different fine-tuning strategies for RAG pipelines, as both embedding and generator models can be fine-tuned but various strategies exist with different trade-offs.

Method: The authors evaluate several RAG fine-tuning strategies: independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase fine-tuning, comparing their performance on question answering tasks.

Result: All fine-tuning strategies achieve approximately equal improvement in EM (Exact Match) and F1 generation quality metrics, but they have significantly different computational costs.

Conclusion: The optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on whether the training dataset includes context labels and whether a grid search over learning rates for both embedding and generator models is required.

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

*Yu-Cheng Chih,Ming-Tao Duan,Yong-Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PureTC-1B is a three-stage stabilization pipeline that reduces Traditional Chinese token-level instability in small language models by 51.3% using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models face token-level instability in Traditional Chinese deployment, unpredictably emitting non-TC characters or code-switching into other languages, creating a practical reliability gap.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: Continual Pre-Training on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization using TC-adherence preferences with LoRA adapters.

Result: 51.3% relative reduction in non-TC output tokens versus base model; 77.2% reduction in incorrect-language tokens versus Llama-3B and 57.2% versus Qwen-1.5B on Named Entity Translation task.

Conclusion: Robust Traditional Chinese adherence is achievable at 1B scale with reproducible, adapter-only, hardware-friendly pipeline that can enhance language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

*Hui Yi Leong,Yuheng Li,Yuqing Wu,Wenwen Ouyang,Wei Zhu,Jiechao Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMAS is a dynamic multi-agent system framework that uses lightweight LLM adaptation to automatically generate optimal graph configurations for specific tasks, outperforming traditional fixed-topology approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems are limited by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, reducing their effectiveness across diverse workloads.

Method: Introduces AMAS with a dynamic graph designer that autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating reliance on universal structural templates.

Result: Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks shows AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Context-sensitive structural adaptability is a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM multi-agent system deployments.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

*John Hawkins,Aditya Pramar,Rodney Beard,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes machine learning models' ability to detect jailbreak prompts that trick LLMs into bypassing safety guardrails, finding that fine-tuned BERT models perform best at identifying both known and novel jailbreak strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that manipulate input text to circumvent safety guardrails, creating a need for effective detection methods to identify these malicious inputs.

Method: The study evaluates different machine learning models' performance in distinguishing jailbreak prompts from genuine uses, with a focus on identifying previously unseen jailbreak strategies. The best approach involves fine-tuning a BERT model end-to-end for jailbreak detection.

Result: Fine-tuned BERT models achieved the best performance in detecting jailbreak prompts using current datasets. Analysis revealed that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure serves as a key signal for identifying jailbreak intention.

Conclusion: End-to-end fine-tuned BERT models are most effective for jailbreak detection, and explicit reflexivity in prompt structure can be used as an indicator of malicious intent to bypass LLM safety measures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

TL;DR: This paper explores overcoming unidirectional attention limitations in LLMs for text embedding tasks by enabling bidirectional attention through additional training steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive LLMs have strong language capabilities but face constraints in text embedding tasks due to unidirectional attention, limiting their semantic representation analysis.

Method: Tested different Llama architecture variants through additional training steps that progressively enable bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Result: Not specified in the provided abstract content.

Conclusion: Not specified in the provided abstract content.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

TL;DR: CLASP is a framework that maps security lifecycle stages to agentic capabilities, providing vocabulary and metrics to evaluate closed-loop autonomous security systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cybersecurity defense systems are fragmented and unable to keep pace with AI-driven offensive systems, lacking frameworks to evaluate closed-loop autonomous security agents.

Method: Introduces CLASP framework aligning security lifecycle (reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis, validation) with agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, reflection & perception), and defines Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score as a composite metric.

Result: Applied CLASP to 21 representative works to identify system strengths and capability gaps, and established requirements for closed-loop benchmarks.

Conclusion: CLASP and CLC Score provide the necessary vocabulary, diagnostics, and measurements to advance both function-level performance and closed-loop security agent evaluation.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support the development of effective MDS models by providing robust automatic evaluation methods that reduce cost and human effort, requiring a strong meta-evaluation benchmark grounded in human annotations.

Method: Introduces MDSEval benchmark with image-sharing dialogues, summaries, and human judgments across eight quality aspects. Proposes a novel filtering framework using Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across modalities to ensure data quality and richness.

Result: Benchmarks state-of-the-art modal evaluation methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced MLLMs and their susceptibility to various biases.

Conclusion: MDSEval is the first comprehensive meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS that identifies and formalizes key evaluation dimensions specific to multimodal dialogue summarization, addressing current limitations in evaluation methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced

*He Zhang,Anzhou Zhang,Jian Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting is a reasoning protocol that uses three roles (Defender, Objectioner, Host) to enable self-revision through questioning, improving accuracy and reasoning quality without retraining models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning protocols like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought lack explicit mechanisms for external questioning that can elicit self-revision and error correction.

Method: Asymmetric protocol with three roles: Defender proposes answers, Objectioner raises question-style objections without direct fixes, and Host enforces consistency and closure. Works purely at prompt level through role-structured turns.

Result: 22% point gain over single-prompt on GSM8K, accuracy on par with CoT, 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from GPT-4.1 judge. Corrects mistakes without tools/human supervision and improves small model performance (19% accuracy improvement on Llama3.2:1b).

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting enables effective self-revision through structured questioning, works across model sizes without retraining, and shows promise for small models and personal device use while making reasoning assumptions explicit.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

### [57] [How Do Language Models Compose Functions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01685)
*Apoorv Khandelwal,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs suffer from a compositionality gap where they can compute individual functions but struggle with their composition. The study identifies two processing mechanisms: compositional and direct, influenced by embedding space geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs use compositional mechanisms when solving compositional tasks, specifically examining the compositionality gap in two-hop factual recall tasks.

Method: Used logit lens on residual stream activations of feedforward LLMs to analyze how they process two-hop factual recall tasks expressed as g(f(x)).

Result: Identified two processing mechanisms: compositional (computing f(x) first) and direct (computing g(f(x)) without intermediate f(x)). The choice depends on embedding space geometry, with direct mechanism dominant when linear mapping exists from x to g(f(x)).

Conclusion: LLMs employ different processing strategies for compositional tasks based on embedding space properties, revealing insights about their internal mechanisms and limitations in compositional reasoning.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

### [58] [Format Inertia: A Failure Mechanism of LLMs in Medical Pre-Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01688)
*Seungseop Lim,Gibaeg Kim,Wooseok Han,Jean Seo,Hyunkyung Lee,Jaehyo Yoo,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses Format Inertia in LLMs for medical pre-consultation, where models generate repetitive but uninformative questions in long dialogues due to skewed turn-count distributions in training data. A simple data rebalancing method effectively mitigates this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs adapted via SFT for medical pre-consultation suffer from Format Inertiaârepetitive, format-correct but diagnostically uninformative questionsâdue to skewed turn-count distributions in training datasets.

Method: A data-centric approach that rebalances the turn-count distribution of the training dataset to reduce the bias towards shorter dialogues.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially alleviates Format Inertia, improving the quality of long medical dialogues.

Conclusion: Rebalancing turn-count distributions in training data effectively mitigates Format Inertia, enhancing LLM performance in medical pre-consultation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

### [59] [What MLLMs Learn about When they Learn about Multimodal Reasoning: Perception, Reasoning, or their Integration?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01719)
*Jiwan Chung,Neel Joshi,Pratyusha Sharma,Youngjae Yu,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathLens is a benchmark that disentangles multimodal reasoning into perception, reasoning, and integration subskills for geometry problems, revealing that different training approaches have uneven effects on these components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of multimodal reasoning models focuses on aggregate accuracy, which obscures where and how models are actually improving. There's a need to understand the specific subskills involved in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Created MathLens benchmark with annotated components: visual diagrams, textual descriptions, controlled multimodal questions, and perceptual probes derived from symbolic problem specifications to ensure consistency.

Result: Reinforcement learning mainly strengthens perception, especially with textual supervision. Textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reasoning. Reasoning only improves with perception. Integration remains the weakest skill. RL improves robustness while multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting.

Conclusion: Multimodal reasoning involves distinct subskills that respond differently to training approaches, with integration being the most challenging component that requires targeted improvement.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

*Anders Gjerver,Rune Frostad,Vedrana Barisic,Melinda Hodkiewicz,Caitlin Woods,Mihaly Fekete,Arild Braathen Torjusen,Johan Wilhelm Kluwer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how to transform engineering design standards into machine-interpretable ontologies for automated quality assurance in plant design and equipment selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering design processes rely on document-centric standards despite digitalization ambitions, creating inefficiencies in compliance checking and equipment selection.

Method: Used modeling patterns to create modular ontologies from international piping, material and valve standards, aligned with ISO DIS 23726-3 Industrial Data Ontology (IDO), and tested on valve selection with semantic reasoning.

Result: Successfully enabled automated validation of valve data sheet compliance with standards and determination of product type suitability using semantic reasoning and executable design rules.

Conclusion: IDO-based modular ontologies enable semantic reasoning for equipment selection and demonstrate the potential for Standards Bodies to transition to digitized Smart Standards.

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

### [61] [Can LLMs Refuse Questions They Do Not Know? Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782)
*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Refusal Index (RI), a new metric to measure how accurately LLMs refuse questions beyond their knowledge, addressing limitations of existing refusal and calibration metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to faithfully measure LLMs' knowledge-aware refusal capability - refusal-based metrics are biased by refusal rates, while calibration metrics are proxy-based and don't capture actual refusal behavior.

Method: Define RI as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. Design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method to efficiently estimate RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.

Result: Experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets show RI accurately quantifies intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability. RI remains stable across different refusal rates and provides consistent model rankings independent of overall accuracy and refusal rates.

Conclusion: RI reveals that while LLMs achieve high accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and fragile. RI should complement traditional accuracy metrics for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of 16 unsupervised metrics for extracting semantic blocks from Russian judicial decisions, showing Term Frequency Coherence and Coverage Ratio perform best but still cannot fully replace human judgment in legal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI in legal NLP demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from judicial decisions without requiring pre-annotated ground truth.

Method: Evaluated 16 unsupervised metrics across five categories (document-based, semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, legal-specific) on 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168 expert reviews using bootstrapped correlations, Lin's CCC, and MAE.

Result: Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson r=0.540, Lin CCC=0.512, MAE=0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson r=0.513, Lin CCC=0.443, MAE=0.139) best aligned with expert ratings, while LLM Evaluation Score showed moderate alignment (Pearson r=0.382, Lin CCC=0.325, MAE=0.197).

Conclusion: Unsupervised metrics enable scalable screening but cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts due to moderate correlations and low CCC values, advancing legal NLP with annotation-free evaluation tools.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

TL;DR: FraudSquad is a hybrid detection model that combines text embeddings with graph transformers to identify LLM-generated spam reviews, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs enables generation of highly persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing, posing threats to online platform credibility and challenging existing detection systems.

Method: Propose FraudSquad - a hybrid model integrating text embeddings from pre-trained language models with gated graph transformers for spam node classification, capturing both semantic and behavioral signals without manual feature engineering.

Result: FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while achieving promising results on human-written spam datasets with modest model size and minimal training data.

Conclusion: The work provides new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail on mathematically simple problems when phrased in unfamiliar syntax, showing systematic 'syntactic blind spots' rather than conceptual gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs fail on mathematically straightforward problems that deviate syntactically from their training data, revealing a brittle coupling between surface form and reasoning.

Method: Rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates from correct examples, quantify syntactic complexity using Dependency Locality Theory (DLT) metrics, and analyze failure rates across datasets.

Result: Higher DLT scores correlate with increased failure rates; rephrasing problems to reduce structural complexity often leads to correct answers, showing errors stem from structural misalignment.

Conclusion: Many LLM reasoning errors result from syntactic complexity rather than conceptual difficulty, and syntax-aware interventions can help mitigate these inductive failures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

TL;DR: SCRIBES is a reinforcement learning framework that generates reusable extraction scripts for semi-structured web content by leveraging layout similarity across webpages, enabling scalable and efficient information extraction without per-page LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-structured web content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes contains substantial factual data but is difficult to extract reliably. Existing methods either lack generalization or are resource-intensive due to requiring LLM inference for each individual page.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with layout similarity across webpages within the same site as reward signal. Generates reusable extraction scripts that can be applied to groups of structurally similar pages. Iteratively trains on synthetic annotations from CommonCrawl data.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o. Enables scalable and resource-efficient web information extraction.

Conclusion: SCRIBES provides an effective solution for scalable semi-structured content extraction from the web by generating reusable scripts that leverage structural similarities across pages, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining high extraction quality.

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

TL;DR: The paper presents multimodal models trained on developmentally plausible datasets that outperform BabyLM baselines, and uses model merging with text-only models to maintain language-only abilities while preserving multimodal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the discrepancy between large-scale vision-and-language models that learn from enormous datasets versus the limited linguistic data children are exposed to during language acquisition.

Method: Develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets, and experiment with model merging using weighted linear interpolation to fuse multimodal and language-only model parameters.

Result: Multimodal models outperform previous BabyLM baselines but underperform in language-only grammar tasks. Model merging with text-only models helps alleviate this problem while maintaining multimodal performance.

Conclusion: Model merging with text-only models can partially address the language-only performance gap in multimodal models while preserving their multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and unintended side effects of traditional post-training methods for LLMs, which make acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors expensive and problematic.

Method: Uses a closed-loop feedback mechanism with dynamic memory management, frequent knowledge fusion, and strong locality guards to mitigate instability and conflicts from sequential edits.

Result: Boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30% across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and continually evolving LLMs that effectively addresses the limitations of distribution-agnostic editing methods.

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and

Result: Comprehensive analysis of RM applications and identification of critical open questions regarding selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement based on existing research and empirical findings.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for effective deployment and advancement of reward models for LLM reasoning through systematic introduction and survey.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

TL;DR: Veri-R1 is an online reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs for claim verification through interaction with search engines, improving accuracy by up to 30% and doubling evidence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing claim verification approaches rely on prompt engineering or predefined workflows without unified training to improve necessary skills like evidence retrieval and reasoning.

Method: Online reinforcement learning framework where LLMs interact with search engines and receive reward signals to shape planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors.

Result: Improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often surpassing larger-scale models. Ablation studies show impact of reward components and link between output logits and label accuracy.

Conclusion: Online RL is effective for precise and faithful claim verification, providing a foundation for future research in LLM-empowered verification.

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models can better predict individual value interpretations by using multi-dimensional subjective annotations (SEAT dimensions) as a proxy for personal interpretive lenses, outperforming single dimensions and baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI systems that align with diverse human perspectives and avoid majority bias by recognizing individual value interpretations shaped by sociocultural backgrounds and lived experiences.

Method: Evaluated whether providing examples of how individuals annotate Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps language models predict their value interpretations across different zero- and few-shot settings.

Result: Providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yielded superior performance compared to individual dimensions and baseline approaches without individual information. Individual variations across annotators highlighted the importance of accounting for subjective annotation behavior.

Conclusion: This study provides the first controlled investigation of how annotation behavior impacts value prediction, establishing a foundation for future large-scale validation beyond demographic approaches.

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation

### [72] [Exploring Database Normalization Effects on SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01989)
*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Schema normalization significantly impacts NL2SQL performance - denormalized schemas work better for simple queries while normalized schemas excel at aggregation queries, with few-shot examples mitigating normalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most NL2SQL research evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking how schema design (particularly normalization) affects performance, creating a gap in understanding optimal schema selection for real-world applications.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 8 leading LLMs on synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper datasets with practical schemes, testing both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Result: Denormalized schemas achieve high accuracy on simple retrieval queries even with cost-effective models in zero-shot. Normalized schemas (2NF/3NF) cause base table selection and join prediction errors but are mitigated by few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas perform better due to robustness against data duplication and NULL values.

Conclusion: Optimal schema design for NL2SQL depends on query types - denormalized for simple retrieval, normalized for aggregation. Schema design should be considered in NL2SQL development with adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

### [73] [LLM-Based Multi-Task Bangla Hate Speech Detection: Type, Severity, and Target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01995)
*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BanglaMultiHate, the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset, and compares various models including LLMs for hate speech detection in this low-resource language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online platforms need reliable hate speech detection, especially for low-resource languages like Bangla where existing tools are limited and most prior work focuses on single-task detection with limited coverage of multi-facet signals.

Method: Created BanglaMultiHate dataset with manual annotations, then conducted comprehensive comparison of classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs using zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA-tuned LLMs are competitive with BanglaBERT, but culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining remains critical for robust performance in this low-resource setting.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned moderation tools in low-resource contexts, with plans to release the dataset and scripts for reproducibility.

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

*Donghoon Jung,Jiwoo Choi,Songeun Chae,Seohyon Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines LLMs' creativity through a process-oriented approach using constraint-based decision-making and authorial personas, revealing that models consistently prioritize Style over other narrative elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs' creativity focus mainly on output quality rather than the creative processes themselves, creating a gap in understanding how AI models make creative decisions.

Method: The study uses controlled prompting to assign authorial personas to LLMs and analyzes their creative preferences through constraint-based decision-making, drawing on narratology principles.

Result: LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other narrative elements (Character, Event, Setting), and distinctive creative profiles emerge across different models when examining their reasoning processes.

Conclusion: The approach provides a novel systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity, offering insights into how computational authors make creative decisions and revealing distinct creative preferences across different LLMs.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Streaming RAG enables tool use in speech-in speech-out dialogue systems by predicting tool queries during ongoing speech, reducing latency by 20% and improving QA accuracy by 200% relative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end speech dialogue systems generate natural responses but suffer from hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. Traditional text systems use tools like web search, but speech systems lack this capability and tool integration increases latency.

Method: Propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG) that predicts tool queries in parallel with user speech. Develop post-training pipeline to teach model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and generate spoken summaries fusing audio queries with retrieved text results.

Result: On AudioCRAG benchmark, streaming RAG increases QA accuracy from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute (200% relative improvement) and reduces tool use latency by 20%.

Conclusion: Streaming RAG enables real-time tool use in speech dialogue systems, improving both accuracy and responsiveness. The approach is modality-agnostic and applicable to typed input as well.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoT is a Streaming Chain-of-Thought framework for Duplex spoken dialogue systems that processes user input in blocks and generates responses continuously, eliminating the need for voice activity detection while improving semantic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VAD-based systems fail to distinguish between pauses and turn completions, while existing duplex models have complex architectures and lag in semantic reasoning compared to cascaded models.

Method: Proposes a Streaming Chain-of-Thought framework that alternates between processing fixed-duration user input blocks and generating responses in a blockwise manner, using frame-level alignments to create intermediate targets for aligned user transcripts and system responses.

Result: The approach produces more coherent and interpretable responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Conclusion: SCoT successfully addresses limitations of both VAD-based and existing duplex systems by providing continuous processing with improved semantic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

*Jameson Sandler,Ahmet ÃstÃ¼n,Marco Romanelli,Sara Hooker,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speculative decoding shows unequal speed-up rates across tasks, with under-fit/underrepresented tasks benefiting less. The paper analyzes this unfairness, identifies contributing factors, and proposes a mitigation strategy that improves fairness by 12% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and address the disparate speed-up rates in speculative decoding, where under-fit and underrepresented tasks consistently receive less benefit, leading to unfair performance distribution.

Method: Derived an analysis to quantify the observed unfairness, identified factors causing disparate speed-ups, and proposed a mitigation strategy to reduce speed-up disparities across tasks.

Result: The mitigation strategy was validated across several model pairs, showing an average 12% improvement in the fairness metric, demonstrating reduced speed-up disparities.

Conclusion: Speculative decoding's speed-up benefits are not uniformly distributed, but the proposed mitigation strategy can effectively reduce disparities and improve fairness in task performance.

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RESTRAIN is a self-penalizing reinforcement learning framework that enables models to improve reasoning capabilities using only unlabeled data, achieving performance nearly matching gold-label training without requiring curated labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning with human-annotated data is costly and struggles with harder tasks, creating need for experience-driven learning that adapts to unlabeled data without curated labels.

Method: RESTRAIN uses self-penalization mechanism that exploits signals from model's entire answer distribution, penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency examples while preserving promising reasoning chains, integrated into policy optimization methods like GRPO.

Result: Achieves large gains on challenging reasoning benchmarks: +140.7% Pass@1 on AIME25, +36.2% on MMLU_STEM, +19.6% on GPQA-Diamond using Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base models, nearly matching gold-label training performance.

Conclusion: RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward stronger reasoning without gold labels, demonstrating effective self-improvement without supervision.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL4HS is a reinforcement learning framework that uses span-level rewards to improve hallucination span detection in LLMs, outperforming pretrained models and supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate hallucinations, and while most prior work treats hallucination detection as binary, real applications require identifying specific hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step reasoning process.

Method: Proposed RL4HS framework using reinforcement learning with span-level reward function, building on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introducing Class-Aware Policy Optimization to address reward imbalance.

Result: Experiments on RAGTruth benchmark across summarization, QA, and data-to-text tasks show RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with span-level rewards is necessary for effective detection of hallucination spans in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

TL;DR: A generalized LLM-based agent called SPINACH translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries through iterative exploration and execution, lowering the barrier for non-experts to interact with knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make knowledge graph interaction accessible to non-computer science users by overcoming the high barrier of SPARQL query language through Text2SPARQL translation, motivated by the Text2SPARQL challenge.

Method: SPINACH - an LLM-backed agent that performs Text2SPARQL translation not as a single-shot process, but as an iterative exploration and execution approach.

Result: The paper introduces the overall architecture and design decisions, and conducts thorough analysis of agent behavior to identify areas for future improvements.

Conclusion: The iterative SPINACH approach shows promise for Text2SPARQL translation and provides insights for targeted improvements in making knowledge graph querying more accessible.

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps in mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models, focusing on whether chain-of-thought reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy but neglect whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions, which can lead to over-trust and potential harmful actions when users rely on seemingly plausible but misaligned reasoning.

Method: Introduces Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA) metric combined with Exact Match (EM) to jointly assess reasoning and execution accuracy, identifying two types of gaps: Execution Gap (reasoning correct but execution fails) and Reasoning Gap (execution succeeds but reasoning conflicts).

Result: Experimental results show reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent across mobile interaction tasks, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Scaling up model size reduces overall gaps but sizable execution gaps persist in largest models.

Conclusion: The framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in state-of-the-art models, offering concrete diagnostics to support development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMPO is a novel RL framework that adaptively uses multiple teacher models to guide LLMs only when they fail, improving reasoning diversity and performance while maintaining self-discovery value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs rely on self-exploration or single teachers, which can introduce model biases and limit reasoning diversity and performance.

Method: AMPO adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models when the on-policy model fails, with a comprehension-based selection mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: AMPO outperforms GRPO baseline by 4.3% on mathematical reasoning and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, significantly boosts Pass@k performance, and enables more diverse exploration.

Conclusion: AMPO demonstrates a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability, achieving comparable results to approaches using more powerful teachers with less data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of social media platforms like X (Twitter) endangers young people's emotional well-being through cyberbullying, but most detection methods focus on English, leaving Arabic-language cyberbullying detection underdeveloped.

Method: Assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed data, verified annotation quality with kappa tool, and tested multiple deep learning models including LSTM, Bi-LSTM with various word embeddings, and BERT-based models.

Result: LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT achieved 97% accuracy, while Bi-LSTM with FastText embedding performed even better at 98% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning models effectively detect Arabic-language cyberbullying with high accuracy, providing valuable tools to protect young people from online harassment.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As
a result, the outcomes are generalize

TL;DR: The paper introduces TECA metric and CER mechanism to help LLMs avoid overthinking by dynamically determining when to stop reasoning, reducing response length by up to 71% on simpler problems without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simple problems (overthinking), which degrades efficiency and makes it difficult to adapt reasoning depth to problem complexity.

Method: Proposes Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA) metric to measure reasoning exploration, and Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism with 'Explore Briefly, Then Decide' paradigm to dynamically determine optimal stopping point.

Result: Experimental results show substantial mitigation of overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability, with average response length decreasing by up to 71% on simpler datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach creates a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process for LLMs by preventing unnecessary lengthy reasoning on simpler problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

*Yaxin Du,Yuanshuo Zhang,Xiyuan Yang,Yifan Zhou,Cheng Wang,Gongyi Zou,Xianghe Pang,Wenhao Wang,Menglan Chen,Shuo Tang,Zhiyu Li,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoMosaic-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' ability to combine general web search with domain-specific tools for complex information seeking tasks across six domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents rely too heavily on noisy web search and lack access to precise domain knowledge. While MCP enables tool integration, it's unclear if agents can effectively use specialized tools alongside general search.

Method: Created InfoMosaic-Bench with six domains (medicine, finance, maps, video, web, multi-domain) using InfoMosaic-Flow pipeline that grounds tasks in verified tool outputs and enforces cross-source dependencies.

Result: Testing 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents showed: web search alone achieves only 38.2% accuracy; domain tools provide inconsistent benefits; 22.4% failures due to incorrect tool usage.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with basic tool handling and integrating multiple information sources, highlighting significant limitations in multi-source information seeking capabilities.

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

### [87] [Parallel Scaling Law: Unveiling Reasoning Generalization through A Cross-Linguistic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02272)
*Wen Yang,Junhong Wu,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities from English Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) to other languages, revealing that models with stronger English capabilities often over-rely on English-specific patterns, limiting cross-lingual generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether reasoning capabilities achieved from English RPT effectively transfer to other languages, challenging the assumption that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reasoning mirrors human cognition across languages.

Method: Systematically evaluating English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks, introducing a cross-lingual transferability metric, conducting interventional studies, and performing parallel training experiments.

Result: Cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across models and languages; models with stronger initial English capabilities show diminished cross-lingual generalization; parallel training reveals First-Parallel Leap and Parallel Scaling Law; identifies Monolingual Generalization Gap.

Conclusion: English-centric LRMs fail to fully generalize across languages, challenging assumptions about LRM reasoning mirroring human cognition, providing insights for developing more language-agnostic models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

### [90] [Drawing Conclusions from Draws: Rethinking Preference Semantics in Arena-Style LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02306)
*Raphael Tang,Crystina Zhang,Wenyan Li,Carmen Lai,Pontus Stenetorp,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLM arena evaluation treats draws as equal performance, but research shows draws indicate query difficulty rather than model equality. Ignoring draws in rating updates improves prediction accuracy by 1-3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing assumption that draws in LLM arena battles indicate equal model performance, suggesting instead that draws reflect query difficulty.

Method: Analyzed three real-world arena datasets using four rating systems, comparing battle outcome prediction accuracy when ignoring vs. including draws in rating updates.

Result: Ignoring rating updates for draws improved battle outcome prediction accuracy by 1-3% across all rating systems. Draws occurred more frequently for very easy queries (risk ratio 1.37) and highly objective queries (risk ratio 1.35).

Conclusion: Future rating systems should reconsider draw semantics and incorporate query properties in rating updates, as draws are more indicative of query difficulty than model equality.

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

### [91] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,AndrÃ©s Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO is a zero-shot video restoration method that uses Video Consistency Models (VCMs) instead of frame-by-frame image diffusion models to achieve temporally consistent reconstructions with high computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based diffusion models applied frame-by-frame for video restoration result in temporal inconsistencies, and there's a need for methods that can handle high-definition video while capturing temporal dependencies.

Method: Leverages Video Consistency Models (VCMs) that distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators with temporal causality. Uses a conditioning mechanism that bypasses automatic differentiation and requires only a few neural function evaluations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions. Shows significant perceptual improvements over frame-by-frame image LDM methods across diverse video inverse problems.

Conclusion: LVTINO establishes a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency for zero-shot video restoration, demonstrating the superiority of video-specific priors over image-based approaches.

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [92] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for fine-grained stylized image generation that extracts style representations from reference images and aligns them with text conditions without modifying the base generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with precise fine-grained style control using natural language, and stylized reference images are difficult to align with textual conditions in traditional generation approaches.

Method: Three-stage training method using a style encoder and style projection layer to extract style representations from reference images and align them with text representations. Uses a custom Style30k-captions dataset containing image-style label-text description triads.

Result: Enables fine-grained controlled stylized image generation by injecting extracted style representations into the generative model while maintaining its structural framework.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully achieves fine-grained style control in text-to-image generation by extracting and aligning style representations from reference images with textual conditions.

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvoStruggle, a dataset for temporal struggle determination during skill acquisition, featuring 61.68 hours of video recordings from 76 participants performing 18 tasks across 4 activities, with 5 repetitions to capture skill evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manipulation datasets don't focus on how struggle evolves over time during skill acquisition, which is crucial for optimizing human learning and developing effective assistive systems.

Method: Collected a dataset with 2,793 videos and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle segments from 76 participants performing 18 tasks across 4 activities (tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, shuffling cards), with 5 repetitions per task. Defined struggle determination as a temporal action localization problem.

Result: Temporal Action Localization models successfully learned to detect struggle cues, achieving 34.56% average mAP when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across activities, showing struggle is a transferable concept across skill-based tasks.

Conclusion: Struggle can be detected as a transferable concept across various skill-based tasks using temporal action localization models, though there's room for improvement in struggle detection performance.

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS is a compact foundation model using lightweight residual U-Net architecture for solving diverse PDEs, achieving SOTA generalization with fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PDE foundation models use large transformer architectures with high computational overhead, while U-Net architectures remain underexplored despite their efficiency potential.

Method: Lightweight residual U-Net architecture with auto-regressive pretraining that mimics numerical solver behavior, pretrained on diverse fluid dynamics PDEs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generalization on 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs across various physical systems with significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: SPUS demonstrates potential as a highly parameter-efficient foundation model for solving diverse PDE systems, offering an effective alternative to complex transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

TL;DR: DisCo is a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes identity diversity in multi-human image generation, solving face duplication and identity merging issues in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models fail at multi-human prompts by duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals, creating an identity crisis in generative models.

Method: Uses Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that penalizes facial similarity, discourages identity repetition, enforces accurate person counts, and preserves visual fidelity through human preference scores. Employs a single-stage curriculum for training stability.

Result: Achieves 98.6% Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread on DiverseHumans Testset, surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods while maintaining competitive perceptual quality.

Conclusion: DisCo establishes a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves the identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark for compositional multi-human generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical geographic embedding approach for visual geo-localization that combines visual appearance features with semantic segmentation maps, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual geo-localization by developing better learned representations of geography and effectively combining visual and geographic information for more accurate location prediction.

Method: Formulates geo-localization as aligning visual representations with learned geographic representations, using hierarchical geographic embeddings and fusing appearance features with semantic segmentation maps.

Result: Achieved improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics across five benchmark datasets, outperforming prior SOTA methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: The combination of geographic and visual representations is the primary driver for performance gains in visual geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAS is a novel data selection method for Large Vision-Language Models that clusters examples based on cross-modal attention matrix trajectories, enabling 50-85% data reduction while preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-efficient learning for LVLMs is underexplored, with no existing methods outperforming random selection at different subset sizes.

Method: Clusters examples based on trajectories of top singular values of attention matrices from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM, then samples balanced subsets from clusters.

Result: Discards 50% of LLaVA-665k and 85% of Vision-Flan datasets while fully preserving LLaVA-1.5-7B performance on 10 benchmarks, with 1.2x training speedup.

Conclusion: XMAS effectively removes redundancy in LVLM training data and achieves significant data reduction while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between continuous flow matching methods and discrete categorical approaches by providing geometric awareness from continuous methods while maintaining the explicit supervision of categorical methods.

Method: Adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space.

Result: Training converges faster than both continuous and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation.

Conclusion: Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified deep learning framework that simultaneously generates synthetic contrast-enhanced CT images from non-contrast CT scans and segments aortic lumen and thrombus, outperforming existing methods in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the use of iodinated contrast agents in CT scans for abdominal aortic aneurysm assessment, which pose risks of nephrotoxicity, allergies, and environmental harm.

Method: Integrates conditional diffusion models with multi-task learning for end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and segmentation, sharing encoder and decoder parameters across tasks and using semi-supervised training for incomplete labels.

Result: Achieved PSNR of 25.61 dB for image synthesis (vs 23.80 dB for single-task CDM), improved lumen Dice to 0.89 (from 0.87) and thrombus Dice to 0.53 (from 0.48), and reduced lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm (from 5.78 mm) and thrombus area error to 33.85% (from 41.45%).

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively reduces contrast agent use while improving both image synthesis quality and anatomical segmentation accuracy for abdominal aortic aneurysm assessment.

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for efficiently prototyping multi-modal video analysis pipelines using pre-trained models to create temporal semi-structured data and queryable knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal content analysis is complex and computationally expensive, requiring significant engineering effort. Existing pre-trained models are available but challenging to integrate with complex data like videos.

Method: Develop a framework that combines pre-trained models into pipelines to convert videos into temporal semi-structured data, then translate this into frame-level indexed knowledge graphs that are queryable and support continual learning.

Result: The framework enables dynamic incorporation of new domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium and supports efficient prototyping of analysis pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the challenges of multi-modal video analysis by providing an efficient way to prototype pipelines and create queryable knowledge representations that support continual learning.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT is a framework that reverse-engineers website functionality into reusable tools, enabling web agents to perform high-level operations like search and filter instead of fragile step-by-step UI interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents are brittle and rely on heavy LLM reasoning that breaks under dynamic layouts and long task horizons, unlike humans who use high-level website functionality.

Method: WALT reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools that abstract away low-level execution, spanning discovery, communication, and content management operations.

Result: On VisualWebArena and WebArena benchmarks, WALT achieves higher success rates with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: WALT establishes a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation by shifting computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation.

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised segmentation framework that uses topological consistency across multiple predictions to preserve meaningful structures in histopathology images, with a novel matching strategy for feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing meaningful semantic structures from unlabeled data in histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed and distinguishing biological structures from artifacts is difficult.

Method: Leverages multiple perturbed predictions through stochastic dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency across outputs. Introduces a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap with global structural alignment to match topological features without ground truth.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach effectively reduces topological errors and produces more robust and accurate segmentations essential for reliable downstream analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully preserves biologically meaningful structures in histopathology segmentation through topological consistency and advanced matching strategies, improving segmentation reliability.

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

### [103] [Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540)
*Jiamu Bai,Xin Yu,Meilong Xu,Weitao Lu,Xin Pan,Kiwan Maeng,Daniel Kifer,Jian Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-LPO extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from pairwise to listwise preferences for text-to-image diffusion models, enabling more precise alignment with human preferences using ranked image lists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO applications in diffusion models rely on pairwise preferences, but human feedback often contains implicit ranked information that provides more precise preference signals than simple pairwise comparisons.

Method: Proposed Diffusion-LPO framework aggregates user feedback into ranked image lists and derives a listwise extension of DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model, enforcing consistency across entire rankings by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all lower-ranked alternatives.

Result: Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines across text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment tasks, achieving better visual quality and preference alignment.

Conclusion: Listwise preference optimization through Diffusion-LPO provides a more effective approach for aligning diffusion models with human preferences compared to pairwise methods, leveraging richer ranking information from human feedback.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bridge is a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that enables both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework using a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and semantic-to-pixel discrete representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified MLLMs face challenges: hybrid approaches break the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches struggle with trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity.

Method: Augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks with only 7.9% increase in sequence length, requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Conclusion: Bridge successfully demonstrates that pure autoregressive unified MLLMs can achieve strong performance in both understanding and generation tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

### [105] [Robust Classification of Oral Cancer with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01547)
*Akshay Bhagwan Sonawane,Lena D. Swamikannan,Lakshman Tamil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Bayesian deep learning model for oral cancer classification using small datasets achieves 94% accuracy on similar test data and 88% accuracy on diverse real-world data, outperforming traditional CNNs (72.94%) while providing reliable uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral cancer has high mortality rates, especially in regions with limited healthcare access. Early diagnosis is challenging due to limited infrastructure, shortage of practitioners, and conventional deep learning models' overconfidence and need for large datasets, which is unrealistic in data-scarce settings.

Method: Proposed a hybrid model combining CNN with Bayesian deep learning using variational inference for uncertainty quantification. Trained on smartphone-captured photographic color images with small datasets and evaluated on three distinct test datasets.

Result: Achieved 94% accuracy on test data similar to training distribution (comparable to traditional CNNs). On diverse real-world photographic data, achieved 88% accuracy vs 72.94% for traditional CNNs, despite smaller dataset. Model showed low uncertainty for correct classifications and high uncertainty for misclassifications.

Conclusion: Bayesian inference effectively enhances model reliability and generalizability in data-scarce environments, improving early oral cancer diagnosis by providing uncertainty quantification and better performance on diverse real-world data.

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CADTrans for source-free domain adaptation, using assistant domains and consistent strategies to obtain invariable features and handle hard samples through conditional multi-kernel MMD alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA methods struggle with hard samples and domain bias due to inability to access source domain data directly, limiting their ability to obtain deterministic invariable features.

Method: Constructs assistant domains from intermediate aggregated global attentions for diversified representations, uses multiple consistent strategies to obtain invariable features, and employs conditional multi-kernel MMD to align hard samples to easy samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126 benchmarks show significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: CADTrans effectively addresses SFDA challenges by constructing domain-consistent invariable feature representations and handling hard samples through conditional alignment strategies.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system that uses historical BLV users' visual questions to guide MLLMs in generating contextually-relevant image descriptions, reducing irrelevant details and anticipating user needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM applications provide comprehensive but often irrelevant descriptions for BLV users, leading to inefficient information exchanges.

Method: Developed a system that identifies similar visual contexts from VizWiz-LF dataset and uses associated questions to guide MLLM descriptions.

Result: Context-aware descriptions anticipated user questions in 76.1% of cases and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons over context-free descriptions.

Conclusion: Using historical BLV user questions to guide MLLMs significantly improves relevance and efficiency of visual descriptions for BLV users.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

*Roman Jacome,Romario GualdrÃ³n-Hurtado,Leon Suarez,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NPN is a novel regularization method that uses neural networks to project solutions into low-dimensional null-space structures of sensing matrices, improving interpretability and flexibility in imaging inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional priors ignore the task-specific structure of the sensing matrix's null-space, leading to suboptimal solutions for ill-posed inverse problems.

Method: Proposes Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN) that promotes solutions in low-dimensional projections of the sensing matrix's null-space using neural networks, rather than enforcing constraints in the image domain.

Result: NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity across various imaging inverse problems including compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, CT, and MRI, working with multiple reconstruction frameworks.

Conclusion: NPN provides interpretable and flexible regularization by focusing on null-space structure, offering theoretical guarantees and practical improvements across diverse inverse problems.

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: The system establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation in genomic medicine by providing interpretable evidence and cost-aware decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical utility.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, emit final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations, and have post-training pipelines that rarely reinforce reasoning quality with weak reward design.

Method: Developed RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting. Created VLA-CoT-13K dataset with chain-of-thought supervision aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Integrated RLVR with GRPO to optimize reasoning and execution.

Result: Extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

Conclusion: VLA-R1 achieves enhanced reasoning robustness and execution accuracy through systematic optimization of both reasoning and execution components, showing strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization capabilities for embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography that simultaneously optimizes clear 3D models and defocus blur kernels from multi-view blurry images using differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defocus blur in macrophotography hinders clear imaging and high-quality 3D reconstruction of small objects, while traditional methods require extensive data and annotations.

Method: Joint optimization of clear 3D model and per-pixel defocus blur kernels from multi-view blurry images using differentiable rendering for self-supervised learning.

Result: The method achieves high-quality image deblurring and recovers high-fidelity 3D appearance from a small number of multi-view images.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses defocus blur in macrophotography and enables high-quality 3D reconstruction from limited blurry input data.

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FideDiff is a single-step diffusion model for high-fidelity motion deblurring that reformulates deblurring as a diffusion process and trains a consistency model to align all blur levels to clean images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient one-step inference.

Motivation: To address the limitations of current diffusion models for image deblurring, including unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity, while leveraging the superior generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models over CNN and transformer-based methods.

Method: Reformulates motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process with progressively blurred images, trains a consistency model to align all timesteps to clean images, reconstructs training data with matched blur trajectories, integrates Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation, and introduces adaptive timestep prediction.

Result: Achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models while enabling efficient one-step deblurring.

Conclusion: FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks and establishes a robust baseline for advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

*Rixin Zhou,Peiqiang Qiu,Qian Zhang,Chuntao Li,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale bronze inscription dataset and a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline with LadderMoE adapters to address challenges in automatic bronze inscription recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance across different domains and character categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bronze inscriptions are crucial for archaeological and historical studies but automatic recognition is difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability (photographs, rubbings, tracings), and extremely long-tailed character distribution.

Method: Created a large BI dataset with 22,454 full-page images and 198,598 annotated characters across 6,658 categories. Developed a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline with LadderMoE adapters that augment a pretrained CLIP encoder, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger robustness.

Result: The method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities (photographs, rubbings, tracings).

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition and downstream archaeological analysis through the curated dataset and robust recognition pipeline.

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

### [115] [VirDA: Reusing Backbone for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Visual Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01660)
*Duy Nguyen,Dat Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirDA proposes a parameter-efficient domain adaptation method using visual reprogramming layers instead of fine-tuning entire backbones, achieving competitive accuracy with significantly fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods require fine-tuning full backbones for each source-target pair, leading to linear growth in parameters and storage, and preventing backbone reuse across domains.

Method: Prepends domain-specific visual reprogramming layers to produce visual prompts that add textural bias to input images, adapting style to target domains. Uses multiple objective functions to optimize intra- and inter-domain distribution differences without modifying backbone parameters.

Result: Achieves 92.8% mean accuracy on Office-31 with only 1.5M trainable parameters. Outperforms PDA by +1.6% accuracy using 46% of parameters, and outperforms CDTrans and FixBi while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8% of their parameters respectively.

Conclusion: VirDA enables parameter-efficient domain adaptation by reusing backbone parameters across domains through visual reprogramming, achieving competitive performance with minimal trainable parameters.

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFE is an unsupervised method that learns a discrete dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences using RVQ-VAE, outperforming FACS in precision and psychological task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial expression coding systems like FACS have limited coverage and require costly manual annotation, creating a need for scalable, data-driven alternatives.

Method: Extract identity-invariant expression features using 3DMM, then encode them with RVQ-VAE to produce discrete tokens from a shared codebook, each capturing reusable facial deformation patterns.

Result: DFE captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and representation learning models in stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection tasks.

Conclusion: DFE serves as a scalable and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications, covering a wider variety of facial displays.

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

*Yongbo Chen,Yanhao Zhang,Shaifali Parashar,Liang Zhao,Shoudong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Con-NRSfM is a novel method for non-rigid structure-from-motion under conformal deformations that performs point-wise reconstruction using optimized 2D image warps in a graph-based framework, accurately computing local conformal scale and enabling precise depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing NRSfM methods that rely on strict assumptions like locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover conformal scale, while improving reconstruction accuracy for deformable SLAM applications.

Method: Uses point-wise reconstruction with 2D selected image warps optimized through graph-based framework, decouples depth and conformal scale constraints, employs parallel separable iterative optimization, and incorporates self-supervised learning with encoder-decoder network for dense 3D point clouds.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction accuracy and robustness on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior performance in conformal deformation scenarios.

Conclusion: Con-NRSfM effectively eliminates restrictive assumptions of previous methods, accurately computes local conformal scale, enables precise depth estimation, and provides robust reconstruction for non-rigid structure-from-motion applications.

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse is a unified framework that decouples robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images into restoration and reconstruction subtasks, using a video diffusion model to restore image consistency before reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images rely heavily on dense observations and complex optimization. The paper aims to address this limitation by developing a more generalizable approach that can handle diverse image inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes UniVerse framework that: 1) converts inconsistent images into initial videos, 2) uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, and 3) reconstructs 3D scenes from the restored images. The diffusion model learns general scene priors from large-scale data.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong generalization capability and superior performance in robust reconstruction. The method can also control the style of reconstructed 3D scenes.

Conclusion: UniVerse effectively addresses the challenge of robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images by decoupling the problem and leveraging diffusion models, achieving better generalization and performance compared to case-by-case degradation modeling approaches.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [119] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight end-to-end framework for template matching that jointly estimates position, rotation, and scaling through geometric regression, achieving high precision and fast inference for industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional template matching methods are inefficient due to exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, while deep learning approaches lack explicit geometric pose modeling, making them unsuitable for real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes a joint localization and geometric regression framework with Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) for template feature injection, depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency, rotation-shear augmentation for geometric-annotation-free training, and a refinement module for improved precision.

Result: The 3.07M parameter model achieves high precision with 14ms inference time under compound transformations, demonstrating strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is highly suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications due to its efficiency, precision, and robustness.

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that enables Vision-Language Models to dynamically determine when to use pixel-level operations based on query difficulty, achieving better performance while reducing unnecessary visual operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with fine-grained visual understanding due to information loss during image encoding and insufficient attention to critical regions. Current pixel-level approaches are inefficient and get distracted by irrelevant details.

Method: Operation-aware supervised fine-tuning followed by rollout-guided reinforcement learning that uses the model's own response feedback to determine when to invoke pixel operations based on query difficulty.

Result: Achieves 73.4% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K with only 20.1% tool usage ratio, improving accuracy while reducing tool usage by 66.5% compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The adaptive pixel reasoning framework enables VLMs to achieve superior performance on multimodal reasoning tasks while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations through dynamic invocation of pixel-level processing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ASRS framework using rotation augmentations and embedding shifts to identify error-prone chest X-ray cases for improved fairness and safety in medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness and reliability concerns in CXR interpretation where models show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, and existing error detection methods struggle with subtle within-distribution errors.

Method: Uses augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) with clinically plausible rotations (Â±15Â°/Â±30Â°) and measures embedding shifts using RAD-DINO encoder to stratify samples into stability quartiles.

Result: Highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall (-0.2 to -0.3) despite high AUROC and confidence, demonstrating ASRS's effectiveness in identifying error-prone cases.

Conclusion: ASRS provides a label-free means for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in medical AI systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

TL;DR: FreeViS is a training-free video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style details and strong temporal coherence by integrating multiple stylized references to a pretrained image-to-video model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video stylization is challenging because frame-by-frame image stylization hurts temporal consistency and reduces style richness, while training dedicated video models requires paired data and is computationally expensive.

Method: Integrates multiple stylized references to a pretrained I2V model, uses high-frequency compensation to constrain content layout and motion, and employs flow-based motion cues to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions.

Result: FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human preference without introducing flickers and stutters.

Conclusion: The training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization.

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

TL;DR: MedQ-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medical image quality assessment using Multi-modal Large Language Models, introducing perception and reasoning tasks across multiple imaging modalities and quality attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical IQA approaches are limited by scalar score-based metrics and fail to capture human-like descriptive reasoning processes used by clinical experts.

Method: Proposed MedQ-Bench with two tasks: MedQ-Perception for low-level visual attribute assessment and MedQ-Reasoning for no-reference and comparison reasoning. Uses 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments across 5 imaging modalities and 40+ quality attributes, including clinical, simulated, and AI-generated images.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs shows preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. Models demonstrate capability but lack consistency and reliability.

Conclusion: Targeted optimization of MLLMs is needed for medical IQA. MedQ-Bench provides a foundation for further exploration and unlocking MLLMs' potential in medical image quality evaluation.

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

TL;DR: InstaFormer is a network that predicts full occlusion and depth orderings for all instances in a scene from a single RGB image input, eliminating the need for expensive labels and multiple forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding instance-wise geometries require expensive input formats (category labels, segmentation masks) and inference costs (quadratic forward passes), making them impractical for many applications.

Method: InstaFormer uses interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information, enabling holistic order prediction in a single forward pass.

Result: The approach is comprehensively benchmarked and ablated to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting occlusion and depth orderings from RGB images alone.

Conclusion: InstaFormer provides an efficient solution for instance-wise geometry understanding by eliminating the need for expensive inputs and multiple inference passes, with open-source code and models available.

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this

Motivation: Existing CNN and transformer-based NST models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles and high-resolution inputs, creating a need for more efficient and effective style transfer methods.

Method: Uses transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE) for hierarchical multi-scale encoding, and incorporates reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize stylization and accelerate convergence.

Result: Reduces content loss by 62.6% (to 2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs, achieving 1.39s inference time. With RL, further improves to content loss 2.03 and style loss 0.75 with minimal speed penalty (1.40s).

Conclusion: Demonstrates real-time, high-quality artistic rendering with broad applications in media and design, offering significant improvements over existing NST methods.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN

that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with

Motivation: Scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting to large unbounded scenes like city blocks is challenging due to memory pressure and inefficient partitioning methods that cause load imbalance and high overhead in existing divide-and-conquer approaches.

Method: Introduces depth-aware partitioning for fast preprocessing, optimization-based strategy to balance visible Gaussians across blocks, and lightweight techniques including visibility cropping and selective densification to reduce training costs.

Result: Achieves up to 2Ã faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

Conclusion: LoBE-GS successfully addresses the scalability limitations of 3DGS for large scenes through efficient load balancing and optimization techniques, making large-scale urban reconstruction practical.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

*Xiaofei Wu,Guozhen Zhang,Zhiyong Xu,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MemoryPack for dynamic context modeling and Direct Forcing to mitigate error accumulation in long-form video generation, achieving minute-level temporal consistency with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video generation faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies while preventing error accumulation in autoregressive decoding.

Method: MemoryPack: learnable context-retrieval mechanism using textual and image information as global guidance; Direct Forcing: efficient single-step approximating strategy for training-inference alignment.

Result: Achieves minute-level temporal consistency, scales gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains linear complexity.

Conclusion: MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

*Cornelius SchrÃ¶der,Marius-Raphael SchlÃ¼ter,Markus Lienkamp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses confidence calibration for 3D object detectors' classification task, proposing metrics and loss terms for calibrating both dominant and secondary class predictions, with evaluation showing different methods work best for different detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are critical for autonomous systems' self-aware and safe operation, particularly for 3D object detectors' classification confidence calibration.

Method: Proposed two auxiliary regularizing loss terms for calibrating either dominant prediction or full prediction vector, evaluated with post-hoc and train-time methods on CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar detectors.

Result: Combining the full class prediction calibration loss term with isotonic regression achieved best calibration for CenterPoint and PillarNet, while DSVT-Pillar could not be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.

Conclusion: Different 3D object detectors require tailored calibration approaches, with the proposed full prediction vector calibration method working well for some detectors but not all, highlighting the need for detector-specific calibration strategies.

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

*Giyeol Kim,Sooyoung Yang,Jihyong Oh,Myungjoo Kang,Chanho Eom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPS is a novel person search framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion models to eliminate optimization conflicts between person detection and re-identification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use ImageNet pre-trained backbones that are suboptimal for person search, and shared backbone features create conflicting optimization objectives between detection and re-identification tasks.

Method: Proposes three specialized modules: Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for person localization, Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to reduce shape bias, and Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to utilize text-aligned diffusion features.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Conclusion: DiffPS effectively leverages diffusion prior knowledge to overcome optimization conflicts in person search, demonstrating superior performance through specialized modules that enhance localization and feature representation.

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

*Yi Ai,Yuanhao Cai,Yulun Zhang,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMU integrates flow matching with deep unfolding for HSI reconstruction, using a mean velocity loss to improve flow consistency and achieve superior reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI is costly to acquire and existing compressive sensing systems suffer from degradation and loss of spectral details during reconstruction.

Method: Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU) that embeds flow matching generative prior within a deep unfolding framework, enhanced with mean velocity loss for global flow consistency.

Result: FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality on both simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully combines interpretability of optimization methods with generative capacity of flow matching for robust HSI reconstruction.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated defect detection system for DIP components using deep learning and ConSinGAN data augmentation, achieving 95.50% accuracy with YOLOv7.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional defect detection is time-consuming and labor-intensive, creating burden on quality inspection and making quality management difficult.

Method: Uses digital camera optics and deep learning models (YOLOv3, v4, v7, v9) with ConSinGAN for data augmentation to address lack of defective images. Focuses on surface and pin-leg defects in DIP components.

Result: YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN achieved best performance: 95.50% accuracy and 285ms detection time, significantly outperforming threshold-based approaches and other YOLO versions.

Conclusion: The proposed automated system can be easily established for various defect types and works well even with insufficient defect data. SCADA system and sensor architecture were also developed.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

### [132] [Foundation Visual Encoders Are Secretly Few-Shot Anomaly Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01934)
*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundAD is a few-shot anomaly detection method that uses foundation visual encoders and learns a nonlinear projection operator to identify anomalies by detecting out-of-distribution regions in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot anomaly detection is challenging due to limited samples, especially under category-agnostic conditions. Foundation visual encoders trained on large datasets can learn general normal image distributions, which can be leveraged for anomaly detection.

Method: The method learns a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. This operator characterizes and identifies out-of-distribution regions in images by utilizing the correlation between anomaly amount and differences in learned embeddings from foundation encoders.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive performance in multi-class detection while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. The approach works with multiple foundation encoders including DINOv3.

Conclusion: FoundAD broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances few-shot anomaly detection by effectively leveraging pre-trained visual encoders for anomaly identification.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

*Fabio Montello,Ronja GÃ¼ldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClustViT reduces Vision Transformer computational complexity for semantic segmentation by dynamically merging similar tokens using pseudo-clusters and regenerating fine details, achieving significant speedup with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have quadratic attention complexity that limits their practical use in real-world robotic systems, especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation where existing token merging methods designed for classification are less effective.

Method: Extends ViT backbone with a trainable Cluster module that merges similar tokens guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks, followed by a Regenerator module that restores fine details for downstream processing.

Result: Achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three datasets while maintaining comparable segmentation accuracy to standard approaches.

Conclusion: ClustViT provides an efficient solution for applying Vision Transformers to semantic segmentation tasks in real-world robotic systems by reducing computational complexity without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT introduces a unified paradigm for MLLMs to directly generate both textual and visual outputs using Visual Reference Tokens, enabling dense prediction tasks like detection and segmentation without relying on indirect representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches for vision tasks rely on indirect representations like generating coordinates as text, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks such as segmentation.

Method: PaDT uses Visual Reference Tokens derived from visual patch embeddings, interleaved with LLM's textual tokens. A lightweight decoder transforms outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions, with dynamic embedding table expansion and independent VRT processing.

Result: Empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks show PaDT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, even outperforming significantly larger MLLM models.

Conclusion: PaDT provides an effective unified framework for MLLMs to handle both textual and diverse visual outputs, overcoming limitations of previous indirect representation methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the trust deficit in online fruit/vegetable e-commerce by proposing a 'Triangular Trust Index' and TriAlignXA framework that balances quality, timeliness, and economic viability through explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'trust deficit' in online produce e-commerce stems from the inability to provide direct sensory perception of product quality through digital transactions.

Method: Proposes 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI) and TriAlignXA framework with three engines: Bio-Adaptive Engine for quality description, Timeliness Optimization Engine for efficiency, and Economic Optimization Engine for cost control. Uses 'Pre-Mapping Mechanism' with QR codes for transparent quality information.

Result: Experiments on grading tasks show significantly higher accuracy than baseline models. The framework demonstrates balancing capability in addressing the 'impossible triangle' of agricultural product grading.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive support from theory to practice for building trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a pathway from algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: 4DGS-Craft is a consistent and interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting editing framework that addresses view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency issues while handling complex text instructions through LLM-based intent understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent 4DGS editing methods face challenges with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, and struggle to handle complex text instructions, limiting their practical application.

Method: Proposes a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model with 4D VGGT geometry features and multi-view grid module for consistency, plus a Gaussian selection mechanism for non-edited regions, and an LLM-based module for user intent understanding and instruction decomposition.

Result: The framework enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing compared to related works, successfully handling intricate user commands through logical operation sequences.

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft provides an effective solution for consistent and interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting editing, addressing key limitations in current methods through geometric feature integration and intelligent instruction processing.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight SR methods like CAMixer have limitations including poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking, and spatial inflexibility. The goal is to develop a more efficient and flexible approach to reduce computational complexity while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Method: PP uses fixed color center points to classify pixels into distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking. It identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive computations, integrated into the ATD-light model.

Result: PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in both reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency while saving similar computational costs.

Conclusion: Pure-Pass provides an effective pixel-level masking mechanism that enables adaptive, fine-grained computational savings in image super-resolution, offering improved performance and efficiency over existing approaches.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: This paper presents a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework that uses GPT-4o to automatically generate jaw cyst findings from dental panoramic radiographs, improving accuracy through iterative correction loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of automated jaw cyst findings generation from dental radiographs by addressing inconsistencies and hallucinations in conventional AI methods.

Method: Developed a 10-step SLSO framework including image analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking, iterative regeneration for inconsistencies, and finding generation with verification. Compared against conventional Chain-of-Thought method across 7 evaluation items using 22 jaw cyst cases.

Result: SLSO improved output accuracy with 66.9% improvement for tooth number, 33.3% for tooth movement, and 28.6% for root resorption. Successful cases achieved consistent output after up to 5 regenerations. The framework enforced negative finding descriptions and suppressed hallucinations.

Conclusion: The SLSO framework shows promise for automated finding generation but requires further refinement, particularly for extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth, to achieve practical clinical application.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Motivation: To develop an efficient 3D autoencoder architecture that can process LiDAR point clouds from real traffic environments without requiring extensive computational resources like state-of-the-art methods.

Method: Proposed LiLa-Net with reduced encoder layers and simplified skip connections to balance information flow between skip connections and latent encoding, enabling efficient feature extraction from LiDAR point clouds.

Result: The model achieves accurate point cloud reconstruction with improved quality, maintains efficient latent space representation, and demonstrates strong generalization by reconstructing objects outside the original traffic environment.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net successfully creates an efficient 3D autoencoder that balances computational efficiency with reconstruction quality, showing promising generalization capabilities for LiDAR point cloud processing.

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Result: Drone-based observations reduced visibility loss by 15% and captured more transitions with higher accuracy. Case studies analyzed 969 behavioral sequences, revealing species-specific behavioral patterns and spatial segregation in mixed-species herds.

Conclusion: kabr-tools enables automated behavioral monitoring at scale, offering a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies that advances conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianMorphing is a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images using mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting and unified deformation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous approaches that rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data, enabling high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling for 3D morphing.

Method: Leverages mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints.

Result: Outperforms prior 2D/3D methods on TexMorph benchmark, reducing color consistency error (ÎE) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%.

Conclusion: The framework successfully preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process without requiring labeled data, establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence using mesh topology as geometric prior.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

*Sahil Bhandary Karnoor,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InPose: A diffusion-based pose estimation method that uses rotational measurements as conditioning and location measurements as likelihood guidance, enabling zero-shot generalization across users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods using conditional diffusion models generalize poorly across users because location measurements are highly influenced by body size variations.

Method: Formulates pose estimation as an inverse problem using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on rotational measurements alone, with location measurements used as likelihood guidance.

Result: The proposed InPose method can generatively estimate pose sequences that best explain sparse on-body measurements for any user.

Conclusion: The approach achieves zero-shot generalization by separating rotational conditioning from location-based likelihood guidance, overcoming body size dependency issues.

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGDM is a transformer-driven diffusion model that combines vision transformers with diffusion processes for brain tumor detection and segmentation, outperforming conventional U-Net approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional architectures like U-Net have limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies, which constrains performance on complex brain tumor structures. Diffusion models show strong potential for medical image analysis but need better integration with global contextual modeling.

Method: Proposed VGDM framework embeds a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, enabling global contextual reasoning with iterative denoising. The transformer backbone models spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes while diffusion refinement reduces voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details.

Result: Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets shows consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance metrics compared to conventional U-Net baselines.

Conclusion: The hybrid transformer-diffusion approach provides improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, advancing the state of the art in tumor segmentation by combining global contextual modeling with boundary refinement capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data for historical urban sprawl analysis in France before the 1970s.

Method: A dual-pass U-Net approach: first pass identifies confusing areas for targeted data augmentation, second pass uses refined dataset and binarized output to reduce radiometric noise. Deployed on HPC cluster to process 941 high-resolution tiles.

Result: Created first open-access national-scale urban footprint dataset for 1925-1950 period with 73% overall accuracy, effectively capturing diverse urban patterns while minimizing artifacts.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the data gap for historical urban analysis in France and provides openly available code, datasets, and nationwide urban raster for future urbanization research.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of point-based tracking failure modes in surgical videos shows it works well for tools but fails for anatomical targets due to tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reliability and failure cases of point-based tracking in complex surgical environments, as it offers efficient zero-shot tracking but its limitations are not well studied.

Method: Systematic analysis of point-based tracking failure modes in laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos, comparing point-based tracking with segmentation mask initialization for gallbladder, grasper, and L-hook electrocautery.

Result: Point-based tracking is competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical targets due to tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries.

Conclusion: Provides actionable recommendations for selecting and placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis, with key factors identified through qualitative analysis.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FFREEDG is a novel federated learning task where models are pretrained on labeled server data and then trained on unlabeled client data without re-accessing source data. FRIEREN framework uses vision-language integration and weak-to-strong consistency learning to address this challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces challenges with domain shifts, especially when client data is unlabeled. Existing methods either assume labeled client data or don't leverage modern Vision Foundation Models effectively.

Method: FRIEREN framework integrates vision and language modalities using a Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings. It employs weak-to-strong consistency learning for robust local training on pseudo-labels.

Result: Experiments on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks show competitive performance against established domain generalization and adaptation methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles the FFREEDG task and sets a strong baseline for future research in federated learning with domain shifts and unlabeled client data.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint is a structured prompting framework that uses action-centric knowledge to improve video anomaly detection in frozen vision-language models by providing fine-grained guiding questions aligned with discriminative visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting methods for video anomaly detection are often too abstract and overlook fine-grained human-object interactions and action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos.

Method: Organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, consistently improving AUC over prior baselines and demonstrating strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones.

Conclusion: ASK-Hint establishes a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection, highlighting the critical role of prompt granularity in eliciting accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs.

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

*Weijia Dou,Xu Zhang,Yi Bin,Jian Liu,Bo Peng,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify is a method that uses a Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features by leveraging geometric priors from a 3D self-supervised teacher model, achieving state-of-the-art 3D semantic segmentation with only 1.5% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for transferring 2D VLM features to 3D semantic segmentation face a trade-off: direct projection yields noisy predictions while geometric coherence requires expensive training pipelines and large annotated datasets.

Method: Uses a Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features with geometric priors from a 3D self-supervised teacher model, plus a Geometry-Guided Pooling module for denoising during inference.

Result: Achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance on major 3D benchmarks while using only about 1.5% of training data.

Conclusion: GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off between 2D semantics and 3D geometric structure through latent geometric information and learned affinity, demonstrating superior data efficiency.

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A noninvasive pig identification system using auricular vein patterns achieves 98.12% accuracy with SVM classification, providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pig identification methods (ear tags, microchips) are unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and impractical for small-scale farmers, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: Collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed pigs using smartphone and back lighting. Developed multistage computer vision pipeline to enhance vein visibility, extract structural/spatial features, and generate biometric signatures classified with machine learning models.

Result: Support Vector Machines achieved 98.12% precision in pig identification across mixed-breed populations. The entire process takes average 8.3 seconds, demonstrating real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: Auricular vein biometrics provide a cost-effective, stress-free alternative to physical identifiers, confirming practicality for digitizing livestock management and extending precision farming benefits to resource-constrained communities.

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

TL;DR: A multicategory counting framework using Twins pyramid vision-transformer with multi-class counting head and Category Focus Module for dense scenes, achieving significant MAE reductions on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address object counting in dense and occluded scenes where traditional detection methods fail, particularly for multi-category scenarios with inter-category interference.

Method: Uses Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone with multi-class counting head based on multiscale decoding, plus Category Focus Module for segmentation-based inter-category suppression during training.

Result: 33%, 43% and 64% reduction in MAE on VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks compared to prior methods; outperforms YOLOv11 in dense scenes; successfully applied to biodiversity monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate multi-class counting in dense scenes and opens up applications to new domains like biodiversity monitoring for conservation efforts.

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempoControl enables fine-grained temporal control in text-to-video generation by using cross-attention maps to align visual concepts with timing signals through correlation, energy, and entropy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models lack fine-grained temporal control, preventing users from specifying when specific visual elements should appear in generated sequences.

Method: TempoControl uses cross-attention maps from text-to-video diffusion models and guides concept timing through a novel optimization approach based on three principles: correlation (aligning temporal shape with control signals), energy (amplifying attention where visibility is needed), and entropy (maintaining spatial focus).

Result: The method achieves precise temporal control while maintaining high video quality and diversity, demonstrating effectiveness in temporal reordering for single/multiple objects, action generation, and audio-aligned generation.

Conclusion: TempoControl provides a training-free solution for temporal alignment in video generation, enabling fine-grained control over when visual concepts appear without requiring retraining or additional supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

TL;DR: RewardMap is a multi-stage RL framework that addresses sparse reward challenges in fine-grained visual reasoning for MLLMs through difficulty-aware rewards and progressive training from perception to reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured settings like transit maps, and standard RL faces challenges with sparse rewards and unstable optimization.

Method: Constructed ReasonMap-Plus dataset with dense VQA rewards, then proposed RewardMap with difficulty-aware reward design and multi-stage RL scheme that progresses from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks.

Result: Each RewardMap component contributes to consistent performance gains, with combined approach achieving best results - 3.47% average improvement across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks.

Conclusion: RewardMap effectively enhances MLLMs' visual understanding and reasoning capabilities through dense reward signals and progressive training strategy.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow is the first framework to effectively use FLUX's strong generative priors for drag-based image editing, introducing region-based editing with affine transformations to overcome limitations of point-based methods in DiT architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous drag-based editing suffered from distortions due to insufficient priors from Stable Diffusion. With stronger priors in newer models like FLUX (SD3.5), drag-based editing hasn't benefited yet, as DiT features lack the structured guidance of UNet features.

Method: DragFlow introduces region-based editing with affine transformations for richer feature supervision, integrates IP-Adapter for subject consistency, uses gradient mask-based constraints for background preservation, and employs MLLMs to resolve task ambiguities.

Result: Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and the novel ReD Bench benchmark show DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting new state-of-the-art performance in drag-based image editing.

Conclusion: DragFlow successfully leverages FLUX's strong priors for drag-based editing through region-based supervision and comprehensive constraints, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: F2C proposes a training-free approach that selects key clips instead of isolated frames for video understanding, using adaptive resolution to maintain computational efficiency while preserving temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs face the 'needle in a haystack' problem where massive visual tokens from raw videos exhaust context windows. Frame-wise selection methods discard essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity.

Method: Extends selection from isolated key frames to key clips (short temporally coherent segments) and introduces adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length to maintain constant token count per video.

Result: Outperforms uniform sampling by 8.1% on Video-MME, 5.6% on LongVideoBench, and 10.3% on MLVU benchmarks. The approach is training-free and maintains computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Preserving temporal coherence in frame selection is crucial for video understanding, and F2C provides a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real-world applications.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with IMU sensors for movement assessment, finding MotionAGFormer performs best among video models, with both technologies viable for out-of-lab kinematic analysis but with trade-offs in cost, accessibility, and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation, requiring comparison of emerging video-based methods with established IMU technology.

Method: Used VIDIMU dataset with 13 daily activities captured by commodity cameras and 5 IMUs. Evaluated joint angles from deep learning models (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose, NVIDIA BodyTrack) against IMU data processed through OpenSim inverse kinematics, following Human3.6M format with 17 keypoints.

Result: MotionAGFormer achieved best performance with lowest RMSE (9.27Â°Â±4.80Â°), lowest MAE (7.86Â°Â±4.18Â°), highest Pearson correlation (0.86Â±0.15), and highest RÂ² (0.67Â±0.28). Both video and IMU approaches are viable for out-of-lab kinematic assessment.

Conclusion: Video models provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults but lag behind IMU-based estimates in some aspects. The study establishes guidelines for developing robust, cost-effective telehealth solutions, highlighting trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches.

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroSwift is a diffusion-based method that integrates AutoKL and CLIP adapters for cross-subject visual stimulus reconstruction from fMRI data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with accurate cross-subject reconstruction due to inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of semantic features in complex visual inputs.

Method: Integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. Uses CLIP Adapter trained on Stable Diffusion generated images with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, pretrains on one subject then fine-tunes only 17% of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: NeuroSwift enables efficient and accurate cross-subject visual stimulus reconstruction from fMRI data with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

### [157] [microCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Adaptation via Coarse-Fine Token Fusion for Fine-Grained Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270)
*Sathira Silva,Eman Ali,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: microCLIP is a self-training framework that enhances CLIP's fine-grained classification by fusing saliency-guided local features with global representations and using LLM-derived classifiers for stable adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's reliance on coarse global features limits performance on fine-grained classification tasks, and prior methods overlook spatial precision when aligning LLM descriptions with CLIP.

Method: Uses Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) to create saliency-guided tokens, fuses them with global CLS tokens, and employs a two-headed LLM-derived classifier with Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation for pseudo-label refinement.

Result: Achieves consistent 2.90% average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks with only light adaptation.

Conclusion: microCLIP effectively uncovers latent fine-grained signals in CLIP through joint refinement of visual and textual representations, enabling improved fine-grained classification performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks from AI-generated videos, requiring both accurate classification and interpretable explanations for transparency.

Method: Fine-tune Qwen-VL using group relative policy optimization (GRPO) with two specialized reward models targeting temporal artifacts and generation complexity, using a curated dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%, and produces precise interpretable rationales for predictions.

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1 successfully addresses the dual challenge of accurate AI-generated video detection and interpretable reasoning, providing a transparent solution for regulators and end users.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

*Justin Cui,Jie Wu,Ming Li,Tao Yang,Xiaojie Li,Rui Wang,Andrew Bai,Yuanhao Ban,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation by using teacher models to guide student models through self-generated long videos, achieving up to 20x longer videos without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for video generation suffer from high computational costs and quality degradation when extending to long videos due to error compounding in autoregressive formulations.

Method: Uses teacher models to provide guidance for student models through sampled segments from self-generated long videos, maintaining temporal consistency without recomputing overlapping frames.

Result: Generates videos up to 4 minutes 15 seconds (50x longer than baseline), substantially outperforming baselines in fidelity and consistency on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring long-video supervision or retraining, demonstrating significant improvements in video length and quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineMask is a physics-guided video generation method that enables realistic rigid body control and interactions using a two-stage training strategy with video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms, limiting their use as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making.

Method: Two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks, training video diffusion models on synthetic scenes and integrating low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning.

Result: Significant improvements in object interactions in real scenes, strong improvements over recent models of comparable size, and effective synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena.

Conclusion: KineMask demonstrates the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in video diffusion models and provides a physics-guided approach for realistic video generation with object control.

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces fine-grained multimodal actions for household robots, incorporating proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation to enable precise real-time control that text-conditioned models struggle with.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models lack fine-grained control needed for delicate household tasks and urgent situations, requiring real-time fine motor control that general-purpose robots need.

Method: Developed a feature learning paradigm that aligns multimodal senses while preserving unique information from each modality, with a regularization scheme to enhance causality of action trajectory features.

Result: Experiments show incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift, with ablation studies confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult for text-conditioned generative models, demonstrating practical effectiveness for household robot control.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

TL;DR: VideoNSA adapts Native Sparse Attention to video-language models, enabling efficient long-video understanding by combining dense text attention with sparse video attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding in multimodal models is limited by context length constraints, causing models to miss key transition frames and struggle with long-term coherence.

Method: Adapts Qwen2.5-VL using Native Sparse Attention (NSA) with end-to-end training on 216K video instruction dataset. Uses hardware-aware hybrid approach: dense attention for text, sparse attention for video.

Result: Achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines. Reliably scales to 128K tokens.

Conclusion: VideoNSA's learnable sparse attention induces dynamic attention sinks and shows optimal global-local attention allocation with task-dependent branch usage patterns.

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

*Ruozhen He,Moayed Haji-Ali,Ziyan Yang,Vicente Ordonez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseShift is a training-free method that recalibrates noise levels in diffusion models based on resolution size to improve low-resolution image generation without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models fail to generalize to lower resolutions than trained on, preventing budget-efficient alternatives for users who don't need high-resolution images.

Method: NoiseShift recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size, addressing unequal perceptual effects of noise schedulers across resolutions.

Result: Significant quality improvements at low resolutions: 15.89% FID improvement for SD3.5, 8.56% for SD3, and 2.44% for Flux-Dev on LAION-COCO; 10.36% for SD3.5, 5.19% for SD3, and 3.02% for Flux-Dev on CelebA.

Conclusion: NoiseShift effectively mitigates resolution-dependent artifacts and enhances low-resolution image generation quality in existing diffusion models without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies predicting dynamic physical properties (elasticity, viscosity, dynamic friction) from videos using three approaches: oracle methods with computer vision, prompt-based methods on pre-trained video models, and MLLM prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable prediction of temporal physical properties from videos that require understanding dynamic behavior over time, which has applications in robotics, physics simulation, and video understanding.

Method: Created three video datasets for different physical properties with synthetic and real splits. Explored three inference methods: (1) oracle using classical computer vision, (2) prompt-based cross-attention on pre-trained video models, (3) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models.

Result: Video foundation models trained generatively or self-supervised achieved similar performance (though behind oracle methods). MLLMs performed worse but could be improved through better prompting strategies.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video foundation models show promise for predicting dynamic physical properties from videos, while MLLMs need further development and better prompting techniques to match performance.

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces sounding object detection to evaluate models' ability to link sounds to the objects that produce them, using a multimodal object-aware framework trained on egocentric videos with automatic object segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Everyday object interactions produce unique sounds, and the paper aims to develop models that can distinguish between sounds from different objects (e.g., spoon hitting hardwood vs carpeted floor) by linking sounds to the objects directly involved in the interaction.

Method: Uses a multimodal object-aware framework trained on in-the-wild egocentric videos. Develops an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks of involved objects to guide model focus. Employs a slot attention visual encoder to enforce an object prior.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the new sounding object detection task and existing multimodal action understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully links sounds to the objects that produce them through object-aware multimodal learning, achieving superior performance on sounding object detection and related tasks.

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Motivation: As 3D scene representation methods like NeRF and 3DGS become widely used, understanding and addressing their security vulnerabilities becomes critical for real-world applications.

Method: Proposes a density-guided poisoning method using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify low-density regions for strategic Gaussian point injection, combined with an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with the method effectively embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates significant vulnerabilities in 3DGS and provides a systematic evaluation protocol using KDE for objective benchmarking of attack difficulty in future research.

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

*Eric Tillmann Bill,Enis Simsar,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOCUS, a theoretical framework for improving multi-subject fidelity in text-to-image models by formulating subject disentanglement as stochastic optimal control over flow matching samplers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with multi-subject prompts, showing attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions, which motivates the need for principled control methods.

Method: Two architecture-agnostic algorithms: (1) training-free test-time controller that perturbs base velocity with single-pass update, and (2) Adjoint Matching for lightweight fine-tuning that regresses control network to backward adjoint signal while preserving base-model capabilities.

Result: Both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style across Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers generalize to unseen prompts.

Conclusion: FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models, providing the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity and unifying prior attention heuristics through a flow-diffusion correspondence.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Result: Extracted over 10 billion data points from 155+ million job ads, including O*NET tasks, occupation codes, tools, technologies, wages, skills, and industry features, creating monthly aggregated datasets from 2015-2025.

Conclusion: The toolkit demonstrates reliability and accuracy, showing potential for research and applications in education and workforce development by providing comprehensive, up-to-date labor market information.

Abstract: Data from online job postings are difficult to access and are not built in a
standard or transparent manner. Data included in the standard taxonomy and
occupational information database (O*NET) are updated infrequently and based on
small survey samples. We adopt O*NET as a framework for building natural
language processing tools that extract structured information from job
postings. We publish the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), a collection of
open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and
accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10
billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the
National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation
codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more
features. We describe the construction of a dataset of occupation, state, and
industry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We
illustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and
workforce development.

TL;DR: MorphGen is a diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy that generates complete multi-channel cellular images across cell types and perturbations, achieving 35% better FID than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate drug discovery and gene editing by simulating cellular responses to interventions through high-content image generation, overcoming limitations of prior methods that compress multi-channel data into RGB images.

Method: Uses diffusion-based generation with alignment loss to match phenotypic embeddings from OpenPhenom foundation model, jointly generating complete fluorescent channels to preserve organelle-specific details.

Result: Achieves 35% lower FID score than prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, demonstrates biological consistency with real images via CellProfiler features, and preserves fine-grained morphological structures.

Conclusion: MorphGen enables controllable generation of biologically meaningful cellular images across multiple cell types and perturbations, advancing in silico simulation for drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising
direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing
drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a
state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy
that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and
perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with
known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to
match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a
state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that
compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing
organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent
channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a
fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological
interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via
CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over $35\%$ lower than
the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a
single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.

hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is essential for large-scale artificial
intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing
public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity
needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across

H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from
three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using

Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four
classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other -
with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets,
such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The

TL;DR: A new neural compression framework using low-rank operations and vector quantization to eliminate decoder bottleneck while maintaining high image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural compression methods suffer from decoder complexity and high computational costs, hindering their adoption despite good compression rates.

Method: Incorporates low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector quantization, performing efficient low-rank operations on learned latent representations.

Result: Dramatically reduces computational overhead in decoding phase while maintaining high fidelity image outputs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively eliminates the decoder compute bottleneck in neural compression/reconstruction systems.

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective sampling dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on sampling risk to improve diversity while maintaining accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temperature-based sampling increases diversity but degrades reasoning quality in precision-critical tasks like mathematical reasoning, due to sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive positions.

Method: Proposes selective sampling that uses a lightweight classifier to predict sampling risk and dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on this risk metric.

Result: Experiments show selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off in mathematical reasoning tasks, even in high-temperature settings.

Conclusion: Selective sampling effectively addresses the accuracy-diversity trade-off in precision-critical tasks by dynamically controlling sampling behavior based on predicted risk.

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid materials discovery is constrained by lack of large, machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural context, with experimental literature being underexploited.

Method: Agentic LLM-driven workflow with dynamic token allocation, zero-shot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost, using GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 Mini models.

Result: Created 27,822 temperature-resolved property records with normalized units, achieving F1 scores of 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields with GPT-4.1. Dataset reproduces known thermoelectric trends and reveals broader structure-property correlations.

Conclusion: The study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset, provides a reproducible extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AGFN, an Adaptive Gated Fusion Network for multimodal sentiment analysis that adaptively adjusts feature weights using information entropy and modality importance to handle noisy, missing, or conflicting modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simple fusion techniques in multimodal sentiment analysis fail to account for variations in modality quality (noisy, missing, conflicting), leading to suboptimal performance in discerning subtle emotional nuances.

Method: Proposes a dual gate fusion mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance that adaptively adjusts feature weights, mitigates noisy modality influence, and prioritizes informative cues after unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction.

Result: AGFN significantly outperforms strong baselines on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust performance. Visualization shows enhanced generalization through broader feature distribution learning.

Conclusion: AGFN creates more robust multimodal feature representations by reducing correlation between feature location and prediction error, decreasing reliance on specific locations and improving generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

### [176] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ is a novel Vector Quantization framework that enhances extremely low-bit quantization for LLMs using geometry-driven innovations: Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance and Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance, achieving superior performance in 2-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices due to their exponentially increasing parameters. Existing Vector Quantization methods suffer from unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation in low-bit quantization scenarios.

Method: RSAVQ introduces two key innovations: 1) Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG) that uses Fisher Information Matrix-induced Riemannian metric to project quantization errors along negative natural gradient direction, and 2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) that constructs channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis for dynamic bit allocation.

Result: RSAVQ outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.4 improvement in perplexity and 1.5 improvement in zero-shot accuracy for 2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B compared to baselines like VPTQ and QuIP#.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical solution for constrained environments and establishes a theoretical bridge between information geometry and neural network quantization, advancing efficient deep learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

*Ali Hatamizadeh,Syeda Nahida Akter,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Jan Kautz,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLP introduces reinforcement learning pretraining that treats chain-of-thought as exploratory actions, rewarding information gain for predicting future tokens, enabling earlier development of reasoning capabilities during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training paradigm only uses reinforcement learning as the final post-training phase, missing opportunities to develop reasoning capabilities earlier in pretraining. The paper questions whether this is optimal and aims to bring exploration spirit to pretraining.

Method: RLP uses information-driven reinforcement pretraining where chain-of-thought is treated as exploratory action. Reward is computed based on information gain (increase in log-likelihood of next token when conditioning on context plus reasoning chain vs context alone), providing dense reward signal without verifiers.

Result: RLP pretraining on Qwen3-1.7B-Base improved overall average across eight math-and-science benchmarks by 19%. With identical post-training, gains compounded with largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks (AIME25, MMLU-Pro). Applied to Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2, overall average increased from 42.81% to 61.32%, with 23% improvement on scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: RLP successfully bridges gap between next-token prediction and chain-of-thought reasoning emergence, demonstrating that reinforcement learning can be effectively integrated earlier in pretraining to develop independent thinking behavior and improve reasoning capabilities across different architectures and model sizes.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

*Bruno Corcuera,Carlos Eiras-Franco,Brais Cancela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS) enhances latent representations by removing noisy/redundant features in images, improving model generalization without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent representations in vision tasks often contain noisy or irrelevant features that degrade model performance and generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposes unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS) that identifies and removes misleading/redundant information for each instance, ensuring only relevant features contribute to the latent space.

Result: Experiments show models with unsupervised DFS achieve significant improvements in generalization performance for clustering and image generation tasks with minimal computational cost increase.

Conclusion: Unsupervised DFS effectively enhances latent representations by filtering out irrelevant features, improving model robustness and performance across various vision tasks without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GÂ²RPO is a novel framework that improves preference alignment in flow-based generative models by introducing granular reward assessments and multi-granularity advantage integration to address sparse reward issues in online RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for integrating RL into diffusion/flow models suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals during stochastic sampling.

Method: Proposes GÂ²RPO with two key components: Singular Stochastic Sampling for step-wise exploration with high reward-noise correlation, and Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration that aggregates advantages across multiple diffusion scales.

Result: Experiments show GÂ²RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines across various reward models in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: GÂ²RPO effectively addresses reward sparsity issues in flow model RL, achieving more precise and comprehensive preference alignment through granular reward assessments.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Motivation: Balance output quality against inference cost in LLM generation, especially when using multiple generations, by developing efficient stopping strategies.

Method: UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm adapted to LLM settings with Bradley-Terry inspired transformation for reward scaling across prompts, learning stopping thresholds adaptively.

Result: Achieved same performance as non-adaptive Best-of-N sampling with 15-35% fewer generations on AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets using multiple LLM-reward model pairs.

Conclusion: Established principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, providing theoretical performance bounds and practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

*Weizhe Chen,Sven Koenig,Bistra Dilkina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSPO is a meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data based on average response length to improve reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, the paper aims to make RLVR more efficient by addressing length-related inefficiencies in training.

Method: Proposed Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO) - a meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on average response length.

Result: LSPO consistently improves learning effectiveness across multiple base models and datasets, with ablation studies providing insights into alternative length signal incorporation methods.

Conclusion: LSPO demonstrates the value of dynamic length-aware sampling in RLVR, offering promising directions for future research in optimizing LLM training for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

*Joykirat Singh,Justin Chih-Yao Chen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Akshay Nambi,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRAAC is an RL method that adaptively allocates reasoning length based on problem difficulty, using self-attention to compress reasoning steps and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models suffer from under-adaptivity - they either underthink (too short reasoning for hard problems) or overthink (unnecessarily long reasoning for easy problems), leading to inefficiency and errors.

Method: TRAAC uses online post-training RL with self-attention over reasoning trajectories to identify important steps and prune redundant ones, while estimating difficulty to allocate appropriate reasoning budget.

Result: Across multiple tasks, TRAAC achieved 8.4% accuracy gain with 36.8% reduction in reasoning length vs base model, and 7.9% accuracy gain with 29.4% length reduction vs best RL baseline, showing strong generalization to non-math domains.

Conclusion: TRAAC successfully balances under- and overthinking through adaptive reasoning budget allocation and attention-based compression, improving both accuracy and efficiency across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

*Litu Rout,Andreas Lugmayr,Yasamin Jafarian,Srivatsan Varadharajan,Constantine Caramanis,Sanjay Shakkottai,Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) enables training-free posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion models for image recovery from noisy measurements, overcoming limitations of existing discrete diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in discrete diffusion posterior sampling including sparse signals from derivative-free guidance, limited applicability of continuous relaxations, and dimensionality issues with split Gibbs samplers.

Method: APS introduces quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding in masked diffusion foundation models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers on linear and nonlinear inverse problems, with additional benefits in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.

Conclusion: APS provides an effective approach for posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion models without task-specific retraining, demonstrating superior performance and broader applicability.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

*Yu-Chien Liao,Jr-Jen Chen,Chi-Pin Huang,Ci-Siang Lin,Meng-Lin Wu,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNS is a novel method for incremental personalization of diffusion models that identifies and fine-tunes concept-specific neurons to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining zero-shot generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating diffusion models incrementally is practical for real-world applications but computationally challenging, requiring methods that can personalize models without losing previous knowledge.

Method: Concept Neuron Selection (CNS) identifies neurons related to target concepts in diffusion models and fine-tunes them incrementally while preserving knowledge of previous concepts through joint training.

Result: CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets with minimal parameter adjustments, outperforming previous methods in single and multi-concept personalization, while enabling fusion-free operation that reduces memory and processing time.

Conclusion: CNS provides an effective continual learning approach for diffusion model personalization that maintains zero-shot generation ability while preventing catastrophic forgetting through targeted neuron selection and incremental fine-tuning.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

### [185] [Equilibrium Matching: Generative Modeling with Implicit Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02300)
*Runqian Wang,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equilibrium Matching (EqM) is a generative modeling framework that learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape, replacing traditional time-conditional dynamics with optimization-based sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in diffusion and flow-based models by learning from an equilibrium perspective.

Method: Discards time-conditional dynamics and learns equilibrium gradient of implicit energy landscape, using optimization-based sampling with gradient descent, adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers and compute.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256Ã256, surpassing diffusion/flow models, and handles additional tasks like denoising, OOD detection, and image composition.

Conclusion: EqM provides a unified framework bridging flow and energy-based models with optimization-driven inference, offering theoretical justification and practical flexibility.

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

### [186] [Quagmires in SFT-RL Post-Training: When High SFT Scores Mislead and What to Use Instead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01624)
*Feiyang Kang,Michael Kuchnik,Karthik Padthe,Marin Vlastelica,Ruoxi Jia,Carole-Jean Wu,Newsha Ardalani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: High SFT scores don't reliably predict RL performance gains; generalization loss and Pass@large k are better proxies for RL outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that high SFT scores translate to improved RL performance, as current practice trains LLMs in two independent stages without reliable predictive metrics.

Method: Trained hundreds of models up to 12B parameters with SFT and RLVR via GRPO, evaluated on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions using $>1M GPU hours across multiple model families and datasets.

Result: High SFT scores can be biased and don't predict RL gains; generalization loss and Pass@large k improve prediction precision by up to 0.5 (2x) in RÂ² and Spearman correlation.

Conclusion: Alternative metrics (generalization loss, Pass@large k) provide strong utility for predicting RL outcomes, challenging conventional SFT-focused evaluation practices.

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

### [187] [Demystifying Synthetic Data in LLM Pre-training: A Systematic Study of Scaling Laws, Benefits, and Pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01631)
*Feiyang Kang,Newsha Ardalani,Michael Kuchnik,Youssef Emad,Mostafa Elhoushi,Shubhabrata Sengupta,Shang-Wen Li,Ramya Raghavendra,Ruoxi Jia,Carole-Jean Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic data alone doesn't outperform natural web data, but mixing 1/3 rephrased synthetic data with 2/3 natural data can speed up training 5-10x. Textbook-style synthetic data alone performs poorly, especially at small data budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality training data is limited for LLM scaling, and synthetic data offers a potential solution to overcome data scarcity limitations.

Method: Large-scale empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs, >100k GPU hours) using unified protocol and scaling laws to compare natural web data, various synthetic data types (rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic data.

Result: Rephrased synthetic data alone isn't faster than natural data, but 1/3 rephrased synthetic + 2/3 natural mixture speeds up training 5-10x. Textbook synthetic data alone causes higher loss. Optimal synthetic ratio converges to ~30% for rephrased data. Larger generators don't necessarily produce better data than ~8B models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data has conditional benefits - rephrased synthetic data shows no model collapse while textbook-style synthetic shows collapse patterns. Work provides practical guidance for synthetic data use in pre-training.

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

### [188] [Sparse Query Attention (SQA): A Computationally Efficient Attention Mechanism with Query Heads Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01817)
*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Query Attention (SQA) reduces computational complexity by decreasing Query heads instead of Key/Value heads, achieving up to 3x throughput improvements for long sequences with minimal quality impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of Multi-Head Attention limits scaling for long contexts. Existing solutions like MQA and GQA address memory bandwidth but not FLOPs reduction, which remains critical for training and full-sequence processing.

Method: SQA reduces the number of Query heads rather than Key/Value heads, directly decreasing attention computation complexity proportional to the query head reduction. Includes theoretical foundation, mathematical formulation, and architectural variants.

Result: Empirical benchmarks on 32k-200k token sequences show up to 3x throughput improvements in computation-bound scenarios (pre-training, fine-tuning, encoder tasks) with minimal model quality degradation in small-scale experiments.

Conclusion: SQA provides a complementary optimization path to existing attention mechanisms, offering significant computational efficiency gains for long sequences while maintaining model quality, discovered during Reactive Transformer development.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

*Yanxu Chen,Zijun Yao,Yantao Liu,Jin Ye,Jianing Yu,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StockBench is a contamination-free benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in realistic stock trading environments, showing that most models struggle to outperform buy-and-hold strategies despite demonstrating some risk management capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering but fail to capture the dynamic and iterative nature of trading, leaving the finance domain underexplored for LLM agents despite its economic importance.

Method: Created StockBench benchmark where agents receive daily market signals (prices, fundamentals, news) and make sequential buy/sell/hold decisions, with performance evaluated using financial metrics like cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and Sortino ratio.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight models showed most LLM agents struggle to outperform simple buy-and-hold baseline, though some models demonstrated potential for higher returns and better risk management.

Conclusion: Excelling at static financial knowledge tasks doesn't necessarily translate to successful trading strategies, highlighting both challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents. StockBench is released as open-source to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExGRPO improves RLVR efficiency by identifying valuable reasoning experiences through correctness and entropy metrics, organizing them into groups, and using a mixed-policy objective for better training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard on-policy RLVR training discards rollout experiences after single updates, leading to computational inefficiency and instability. The role of experience characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains underexplored.

Method: Proposes ExGRPO framework that identifies valuable experiences using rollout correctness and entropy as indicators, organizes experiences into groups, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation.

Result: Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show consistent improvement in reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks with average gains of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. ExGRPO stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods fail.

Conclusion: Principled experience management is a key ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR, with correctness and entropy serving as effective indicators of experience value.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

TL;DR: DialTree-RPO is an RL framework with tree search that autonomously discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies against LLMs, achieving 25.9% higher attack success rate than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs remain vulnerable to multi-turn adversarial attacks, but existing approaches rely on manual red-teaming or pre-defined templates, failing to explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attack trajectories emerging from complex dialogue dynamics.

Method: An on-policy reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that treats dialogue as a sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without manually curated data.

Result: Achieves more than 25.9% higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) across 10 target models compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively uncovers new attack strategies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully learns optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success across multiple turns, demonstrating superior performance in discovering diverse multi-turn attack strategies.

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

### [193] [Jailbreaking LLMs via Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01223)
*Hui Dou,Ning Xu,Yiwen Zhang,Kaibin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RTS-Attack is an automated framework that uses semantically relevant nested scenarios with targeted toxic knowledge to bypass LLM alignment defenses, achieving superior jailbreak performance while maintaining concealment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful responses, and existing nested scenario methods are easily detectable due to prominent malicious intentions. The authors discovered that LLM alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios that are highly semantically relevant to queries and incorporate targeted toxic knowledge.

Method: Proposed RTS-Attack framework that builds scenarios highly relevant to queries and integrates targeted toxic knowledge to bypass LLM alignment defenses. The method generates jailbreak prompts free from harmful queries for better concealment.

Result: Extensive experiments show RTS-Attack achieves superior performance in both efficiency and universality compared to baselines across diverse advanced LLMs including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro.

Conclusion: RTS-Attack effectively bypasses LLM alignment defenses through semantically relevant nested scenarios with targeted toxic knowledge, demonstrating that current alignment methods have vulnerabilities in handling such sophisticated attack strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the

Motivation: Addressing risks of synthetic media misuse (misinformation, deepfakes, IP violations) and limitations of traditional watermarking methods that degrade quality, are easily removed, or require confidential model access.

Method: Uses ZK-SNARKs for verifiable proof of origin without exposing model internals, Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC) to convert key layers into circuits for faster proof generation, and LSB steganography to embed proofs imperceptibly in images.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on both GAN and Diffusion models, providing a secure, model-agnostic pipeline for trustworthy AI image generation with significantly reduced proof generation time.

Conclusion: ZK-WAGON offers a practical solution for secure and scalable watermarking of AI-generated images, addressing authenticity and ownership concerns while maintaining image quality and model confidentiality.

Abstract: As image generation models grow increasingly powerful and accessible,
concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse of synthetic media have
become critical. The ability to generate lifelike images indistinguishable from
real ones introduces risks such as misinformation, deepfakes, and intellectual
property violations. Traditional watermarking methods either degrade image
quality, are easily removed, or require access to confidential model internals
- making them unsuitable for secure and scalable deployment. We are the first
to introduce ZK-WAGON, a novel system for watermarking image generation models
using the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non Interactive Argument of Knowledge
(ZK-SNARKs). Our approach enables verifiable proof of origin without exposing
model weights, generation prompts, or any sensitive internal information. We
propose Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC), a method to selectively
convert key layers of an image generation model into a circuit, reducing proof
generation time significantly. Generated ZK-SNARK proofs are imperceptibly
embedded into a generated image via Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.
We demonstrate this system on both GAN and Diffusion models, providing a
secure, model-agnostic pipeline for trustworthy AI image generation.

### [195] [WAInjectBench: Benchmarking Prompt Injection Detections for Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01354)
*Yinuo Liu,Ruohan Xu,Xilong Wang,Yuqi Jia,Neil Zhenqiang Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: First comprehensive benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents, evaluating both text-based and image-based detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiple prompt injection attacks exist against web agents, but no systematic evaluation of detection methods has been conducted specifically for web agents.

Method: Created fine-grained attack categorization, constructed datasets with malicious/benign text and images, systematized detection methods, and evaluated performance across multiple scenarios.

Result: Some detectors work well against explicit textual instructions or visible image perturbations, but largely fail against attacks without explicit instructions or with imperceptible perturbations.

Conclusion: Current detection methods have limitations, particularly against sophisticated attacks, highlighting the need for improved defenses against prompt injection in web agents.

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At
the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

*Niloofar Mireshghallah,Tianshi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM privacy research overemphasizes training data memorization while neglecting more immediate threats like data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent risks, and democratized surveillance through deep inference attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the disproportionate focus on verbatim memorization in LLM privacy discourse and bring attention to more scalable and immediate privacy threats that remain underexplored.

Method: Presents a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM lifecycle, demonstrates failures of current privacy frameworks through case studies, and conducts longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers from 2016-2025.

Result: Reveals that memorization receives outsized attention while the most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches offer little traction and viable solutions remain unclear.

Conclusion: Calls for a fundamental shift in LLM privacy research approach - moving beyond narrow technical solutions and embracing interdisciplinary approaches to address the sociotechnical nature of emerging threats.

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

### [197] [Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01284)
*Chetwin Low,Weimin Wang,Calder Katyal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Ovi is a unified audio-video generation model that uses twin-DiT modules with blockwise cross-modal fusion to generate synchronized audio and video in a single process, eliminating the need for separate pipelines or post-processing alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audio-video generation relies on complex multi-stage architectures or sequential synthesis, which can lead to synchronization issues and requires separate processing pipelines.

Method: Uses twin-DiT modules with blockwise cross-modal fusion, initializing an audio tower identical to a pretrained video model. Fusion is achieved through joint training with timing exchange (scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantic exchange (bidirectional cross-attention) on a large video corpus.

Result: The model generates realistic sound effects and speech with rich speaker identity and emotion, producing movie-grade video clips with natural synchronization between audio and video.

Conclusion: Ovi provides a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that achieves natural synchronization and high-quality output through single-process modeling, enabling cinematic storytelling with accurate context-matched sound effects.

Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures
or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified
paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single
generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules,
Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate
pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion
modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that
of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of
thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic
sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and
emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio
towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and
semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our
model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate,
context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the
demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi

*Tao Han,Ang Li,Qinyu Chen,Chang Gao*

TL;DR: JaneEye is an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator using novel ConvJANET layers that halve computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy for XR wearables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems fail to meet XR's requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras offer ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption as an alternative.

Method: Proposed an ultra-lightweight neural network with novel ConvJANET layer (simplified ConvLSTM retaining only forget gate), custom linear approximations of activation functions, fixed-point quantization, and software-hardware co-design for 12-nm ASIC implementation.

Result: Achieved 2.45 pixel error on 3ET+ dataset with only 17.6K parameters, up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. ASIC operates at 400 MHz with 0.5 ms latency (2000 FPS) and 18.9 Î¼J/frame energy efficiency.

Conclusion: JaneEye sets a new benchmark for low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for next-generation XR wearables.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in
Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems
often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,
and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering
ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we
present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware
accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,
high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural
network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the
traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving
computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our
proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+
dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To
further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of
activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.
Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at
400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames
Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a
new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable
for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

### [200] [An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01361)
*Conall Daly,Darren Ramsook,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PSNR_DIV is a new quality metric for video frame interpolation that enhances PSNR using motion divergence weighting to detect temporal inconsistencies, achieving better correlation than FloLPIPS while being 2.5x faster and using 4x less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence in video frame interpolation, while specialized metrics like FloLPIPS are computationally inefficient for practical use.

Method: The approach enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, adapted from archival film restoration, which highlights singularities in motion fields to weight image errors.

Result: Evaluation on BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences) shows PSNR_DIV achieves +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient improvement over FloLPIPS, is 2.5x faster, uses 4x less memory, and performs consistently across content categories.

Conclusion: PSNR_DIV provides efficient and accurate quality evaluation for video frame interpolation, enabling practical use as a loss function for training neural networks in VFI tasks.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video
enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual
impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and
LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored
towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but
suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application.
We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric
that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted
from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal
inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which
is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180
sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods)
shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant
improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while
being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains
consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator
used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast
quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural
networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric
is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.

### [201] [Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01666)
*Jianxu Wang,Ge Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: M2M is a zero-shot denoising framework that addresses structured noise using pseudo-independent sub-image pairs generated from single noisy inputs, outperforming existing methods on correlated noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images often have structured noise with anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle with. Data-driven approaches need large datasets and have limited generalizability, while zero-shot methods only work for i.i.d. noise.

Method: Uses directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to generate pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from single noisy inputs, with randomized assignment to eliminate systematic bias for Noise2Noise training.

Result: M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise and consistently outperforms them under correlated noise in realistic simulation studies.

Conclusion: M2M is an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and represents the first effective zero-shot denoising method beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical
imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with
strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most
data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and
still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods
avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median
(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M
introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent
sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional
interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values
distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling
space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is
employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for
Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par
with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently
outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an
efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the
first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d.
assumption.

### [202] [GFSR-Net: Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network for Interpretable Deep Learning in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01919)
*Jhonatan Contreras,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GFSR-Net improves medical image analysis interpretability by using human annotations to guide model focus toward diagnostically relevant areas, achieving comparable accuracy with better saliency maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging lack interpretability, may rely on irrelevant image regions or artifacts, reducing clinical trust and increasing diagnostic risks.

Method: GFSR-Net uses sparse human annotations to approximate intuitive focus areas without precise boundaries, training the model to align its attention with diagnostically meaningful features.

Result: Experiments show GFSR-Net achieves comparable or superior accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations and reduce reliance on irrelevant patterns.

Conclusion: The approach increases confidence in automated diagnostic tools by improving interpretability and reliability across various medical imaging modalities.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis,
however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of
interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without
explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to
the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in
real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of
misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance
Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and
reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human
annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image
intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings,
making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to
align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry
diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and
medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological
images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior
accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations.
This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in
automated diagnostic tools.

*Jong Bum Won,Wesley De Neve,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SpurBreast is a curated breast MRI dataset designed to study spurious correlations in medical imaging, identifying magnetic field strength and image orientation as dominant spurious signals that DNNs exploit, leading to poor generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of spurious correlations in medical imaging where DNNs learn non-clinical features instead of meaningful medical patterns, and the lack of datasets designed to systematically study this issue.

Method: Created SpurBreast dataset with intentional spurious correlations by analyzing over 100 patient, device, and imaging protocol features. Used controlled dataset splits to evaluate model performance and generalization.

Result: Identified two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (global feature) and image orientation (local feature). DNNs achieved high validation accuracy by exploiting these non-clinical signals but failed to generalize to unbiased test data.

Conclusion: SpurBreast enables systematic investigation of spurious correlations in medical imaging, providing benchmark datasets for studying clinically relevant/irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation, adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical
imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious
correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of
meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed
to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and
limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce
SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates
spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing
over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify
two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature
influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting
spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs
can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy
while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets
containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without
spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate
clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation,
adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are

*Amirreza Tanevardi,Pooria Abbas Rad Moghadam,Sajjad Amini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Modified consistency sampling for inverse imaging problems that guides stochasticity with measurement-consistency to enforce data fidelity while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are slow for practical deployment due to multi-step sampling, and consistency models' adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored despite their efficiency.

Method: Modified consistency sampling with measurement-consistency mechanism that guides stochasticity using the measurement operator to enforce fidelity to acquired measurements.

Result: Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom show improved perceptual and pixel-level metrics (FID, KID, PSNR, SSIM) compared to baseline consistency sampling.

Conclusion: The approach achieves competitive or superior reconstructions with only a few steps, making it practical for inverse problem applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse
imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits
practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling
high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct
adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a
modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem
reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a
measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which
enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency
of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level
metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance,
peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared
to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior
reconstructions with only a handful of steps.

TL;DR: A blackboard-based multi-agent system for data discovery in large data lakes that outperforms existing methods by 13-57% in task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with large heterogeneous data lakes - single-agent systems get overwhelmed and multi-agent master-slave systems require precise knowledge of sub-agent capabilities.

Method: A multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by blackboard architecture where a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard and autonomous subordinate agents volunteer to respond based on their capabilities.

Result: Achieved 13-57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success and up to 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: The blackboard paradigm establishes a scalable and generalizable communication framework for multi-agent systems in data discovery tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VENTURA is a vision-language navigation system that fine-tunes image diffusion models for path planning, generating visual path masks that are converted to executable trajectories by a lightweight policy, achieving improved success rates and collision reduction in real-world navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in unstructured environments. While Vision-Language models provide strong language-perception grounding, they are difficult to steer for navigation due to action space differences and pretraining objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks.

Method: VENTURA fine-tunes internet-pretrained image diffusion models to generate path masks (visual plans) in image space instead of directly predicting low-level actions. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy then grounds these visual plans into executable trajectories. Training scales by using path masks from self-supervised tracking models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual annotation.

Result: In real-world evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines, improving success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen scenarios. It also generalizes to unseen combinations of distinct tasks, showing emergent compositional capabilities.

Conclusion: VENTURA provides an effective approach for vision-language navigation by generating visual path plans that capture fine-grained, context-aware behaviors, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions while achieving improved performance and generalization in real-world environments.

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable collection of high-quality human demonstrations for complex bimanual manipulation tasks that can transfer from in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots, addressing the challenge of creating generalizable robot policies.

Method: Uses a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized controllers that mirror robot end-effectors, featuring immersive 3D model rendering, wearable computer, and calibration methods. Key innovation is capturing active egocentric perception by recording operator's deliberate head movements via head-mounted display.

Result: Achieved 70% average success rate on in-distribution bimanual tasks and maintained 56% success rate when tested on novel objects and new environments, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Portable data collection systems coupled with learned active perception provide an effective and scalable pathway toward creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual

display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and
manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a
56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our
results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with
learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward
creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

### [208] [DisCo-Layout: Disentangling and Coordinating Semantic and Physical Refinement in a Multi-Agent Framework for 3D Indoor Layout Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02178)
*Jialin Gao,Donghao Zhou,Mingjian Liang,Lihao Liu,Chi-Wing Fu,Xiaowei Hu,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DisCo-Layout is a novel framework for 3D indoor layout synthesis that disentangles physical and semantic refinement using specialized tools and multi-agent coordination to generate realistic and coherent layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets, and recent LLM/VLM approaches lack robust refinement capabilities, leading to suboptimal layouts.

Method: Uses disentangled refinement with Semantic Refinement Tool (SRT) for abstract relationships and Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) for spatial issues via grid-matching. Multi-agent framework coordinates tools with planner, designer, and evaluator roles.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts.

Conclusion: DisCo-Layout effectively addresses refinement challenges in 3D layout synthesis through disentangled physical and semantic refinement with intelligent tool coordination.

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

*Tianchong Jiang,Jingtian Ji,Xiangshan Tan,Jiading Fang,Anand Bhattad,Vitor Guizilini,Matthew R. Walter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper studies view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning policies on camera extrinsics, showing this significantly improves generalization across viewpoints for behavior cloning policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of viewpoint shifts in imitation learning, where policies often fail when camera positions change, by making policies explicitly aware of camera extrinsics.

Method: Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays to condition policies on camera extrinsics, evaluated on six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and ManiSkill with fixed and randomized scene variants.

Result: Policies without extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds, which fails when workspace geometry or camera placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and enables robust RGB-only control.

Conclusion: Explicitly conditioning policies on camera extrinsics is crucial for robust view-invariant imitation learning, preventing reliance on background cues and enabling generalization across viewpoint changes.

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

*Sarath Sreedharan,Kelsey Sikes,Nathaniel Blanchard,Lisa Mason,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Jill Zarestky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using expert-curated knowledge with explainable AI (XAI) techniques to automatically generate lessons and develop adaptive tutoring systems, demonstrated through a pollinator identification case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the overlooked role of domain expert knowledge in creating effective AI tutoring systems and demonstrate how expert knowledge can enhance educational technology.

Method: Proposes two approaches: 1) Using expert-specified problem-solving rules with XAI techniques to automatically generate lessons, 2) Leveraging expert-designed curricula to develop adaptive tutoring systems with more efficient algorithms.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework showing how expert knowledge can be integrated with AI techniques to create novel educational systems, with a case study on pollinator identification.

Conclusion: Expert-curated knowledge is crucial for developing effective AI tutoring systems, enabling automatic lesson generation and adaptive learning experiences through integration with XAI techniques and curriculum design.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VaPR is a hard-negative response generation framework that addresses noise in synthetic preference annotations by creating rejected responses with targeted errors while maintaining stylistic and length similarity to accepted responses, leading to significant performance improvements in LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference finetuning methods like DPO overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations, particularly stylistic and length biases that can affect model alignment with human preferences.

Method: Developed a hard-negative response generation framework using LLM-guided response editing to produce rejected responses with targeted errors while maintaining stylistic and length similarity to accepted responses. Created the VaPR dataset with 30K high-quality samples for finetuning LVLMs.

Result: VaPR models achieved significant performance improvements: 6.5% average gain for LLaVA, 4.0% for Qwen2VL, and 1.5% for Qwen2.5VL across ten benchmarks, with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. Also reduced the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions and showed consistent scaling with data size.

Conclusion: The VaPR framework effectively addresses noise in synthetic preference data and generalizes well to open-source LLMs as editors, achieving ~99% of the performance of GPT-4o synthesized data while providing a scalable solution for improving LVLM alignment.

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

### [212] [Agentic Jigsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing Visual Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01304)
*Yu Zeng,Wenxuan Huang,Shiting Huang,Xikun Bao,Yukun Qi,Yiming Zhao,Qiuchen Wang,Lin Chen,Zehui Chen,Huaian Chen,Wanli Ouyang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGILE is an agentic jigsaw interaction learning method that significantly improves VLMs' visual perception and reasoning through interactive puzzle solving with code execution and visual feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform poorly on simple jigsaw tasks, revealing fundamental limitations in perceptual and reasoning abilities, while high-quality vision-language training data is scarce and not scalable.

Method: Formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process where the model generates executable code to perform actions based on current state, and receives fine-grained visual feedback from the environment to guide task completion through iterative cycles.

Result: Achieved dramatic improvements on jigsaw tasks (from 9.5% to 82.8% accuracy on 2x2 puzzles) and strong generalization across 9 vision tasks with average 3.1% improvement.

Conclusion: AGILE provides an efficient, scalable solution to multimodal data scarcity and opens new avenues for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models through interactive learning.

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

*Darshan Deshpande,Varun Gangal,Hersh Mehta,Anand Kannappan,Rebecca Qian,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEMTRACK is a benchmark for evaluating long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments, focusing on realistic organizational workflows with asynchronous events across platforms like Slack, Linear, and Git.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing context and memory benchmarks focus on conversational instances, but there's a crucial need for evaluating memory in dynamic enterprise environments for effective application.

Method: MEMTRACK integrates asynchronous events across multiple communication and productivity platforms, providing chronologically platform-interleaved timelines with noisy, conflicting, cross-referring information. The dataset is curated through manual expert design and scalable agent-based synthesis.

Result: Experiments show challenges in utilizing memory across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving contradictions. The best performing GPT-5 model only achieves 60% Correctness score on MEMTRACK.

Conclusion: MEMTRACK provides an extensible framework for advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents beyond conversational setups, setting the stage for multi-agent, multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings.

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

### [215] [Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01367)
*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE detects implicit reward hacking by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to pass verification, identifying shortcuts through truncated reasoning analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking poses a significant threat where models exploit loopholes in reward functions without solving intended tasks, particularly when hacking is implicit and bypasses chain-of-thought monitors.

Method: TRACE progressively truncates a model's chain-of-thought at various lengths, forces the model to answer, and measures verifier-passing rates at each cutoff to quantify effort and detect shortcuts.

Result: TRACE achieves over 65% gains over 72B CoT monitors in math reasoning and over 30% gains over 32B monitors in coding, and can discover unknown loopholes during training.

Conclusion: TRACE provides a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective against implicit reward hacking.

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A distillation pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence by extracting hints from failures, generating improved teacher trajectories, and training students to internalize knowledge without runtime dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often fail predictably due to unmet preconditions, redundant commands, or mishandling constraints. While RAG can help, it requires external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) extract compact reusable hints from agent failures, (2) generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, (3) train student models on trajectories with hints removed to force internalization rather than memorization.

Result: Distilled students consistently outperform baselines: 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% baseline) and 72 WebShop score (vs. 61 baseline), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers.

Conclusion: Retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies, generalizing across model scales (7B/14B) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct).

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE introduces visual uncertainty guided exploration for MLLMs, treating images as stochastic contexts and using KL divergence to quantify policy sensitivity to visual perturbations, improving multimodal reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods for MLLMs struggle with exploration and treat visual input as deterministic, overlooking visual ambiguity and failing to build policies robust to visual variations.

Method: VOGUE shifts exploration from text to visual space by treating images as stochastic contexts, quantifying policy sensitivity using symmetric KL divergence between raw and noisy branches, and using uncertainty-proportional bonus with token-entropy bonus and annealed sampling.

Result: Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B, VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by 2.6% on visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on general reasoning benchmarks, while improving pass@4 performance and mitigating exploration decay.

Conclusion: Grounded exploration in visual input uncertainty is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoSeeker is an LLM planning framework that integrates task planning with active information seeking to handle uncertainty in both observations and environmental dynamics, achieving 74% performance improvement over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM planning agents address observational uncertainty but overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and the actual environment, which is crucial for robust problem-solving in partially observable environments.

Method: InfoSeeker prompts LLMs to actively gather information by planning actions to validate understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans.

Result: InfoSeeker achieves 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample efficiency, and generalizes well across LLMs and established benchmarks like robotic manipulation and web navigation.

Conclusion: Tight integration of planning and information seeking is essential for robust behavior in partially observable environments with incomplete information and noisy dynamics.

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) paradoxically shrinks reasoning boundaries in LLMs due to negative interference and winner-take-all effects, but a data curation algorithm focusing on low-likelihood problems improves Pass@k performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why RLVR, despite being designed to improve LLM reasoning capabilities, actually shrinks reasoning boundaries and understand the underlying learning dynamics causing this failure.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of RLVR learning dynamics on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, identifying negative interference and winner-take-all phenomena, followed by proposing a data curation algorithm that focuses learning on low-likelihood problems.

Result: RLVR suffers from negative interference (learning some problems reduces performance on others) and winner-take-all effects (reinforcing high-likelihood problems while suppressing low-likelihood ones), leading to Pass@k performance decline. The proposed data curation algorithm achieves notable improvement in Pass@k performance.

Conclusion: Standard RL objectives with on-policy sampling cause RLVR to converge toward narrow solution strategies, but focusing learning on low-likelihood problems through data curation can mitigate these issues and improve reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

*Yubin Kim,Taehan Kim,Eugene Park,Chunjong Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Daniel McDuff,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink is a safety alignment method that enables LLMs to perform inverse thinking by reasoning through potential failure modes before generating responses, achieving significant safety improvements while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective safety alignment approach that proactively identifies and avoids potential harms, addressing limitations of existing methods that directly optimize for safe responses without systematic risk consideration.

Method: Instructs models to: 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Implemented via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning across three LLM families.

Result: Achieves up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. Shows stronger safety scaling with model size, mitigates safety tax by preserving general reasoning capabilities, and excels in high-stakes domains including medicine, finance, law, and agentic risk scenarios.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning through InvThink provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models by systematically considering failure modes before response generation.

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-use agents are unreliable for long-horizon complex tasks due to high variance, limiting their practical application.

Method: bBoN generates multiple agent rollouts and selects the best trajectory using behavior narratives that describe the agents' actions and outcomes.

Result: Achieves 69.9% success rate on OSWorld (approaching 72% human-level), establishes new state-of-the-art, and shows strong generalization across Windows and Android platforms.

Conclusion: Scaling computer-use agents effectively requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve robust performance.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

*Min Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsychoBench, a benchmark based on U.S. national counselor certification exams to evaluate whether LLMs can meet the qualifications required for psychological counseling roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can be effectively applied to psychological counseling by assessing if they possess sufficient psychological knowledge to pass professional certification exams.

Method: Created PsychoBench - a comprehensive benchmark with 2,252 single-choice questions from U.S. national counselor examinations that requires deep psychological understanding across various sub-disciplines.

Result: Advanced models like GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieved well above the 70% passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remained far below the passing standard.

Conclusion: Only frontier LLMs currently meet counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and challenges in developing psychology-oriented LLMs for counseling applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD) - pursuing goals regardless of feasibility, safety, or context. The paper introduces BLIND-ACT benchmark to evaluate BGD patterns and finds high BGD rates (80.8%) across nine frontier models, highlighting persistent safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUAs are increasingly deployed to act on GUIs, but they consistently pursue goals without considering feasibility, safety, or context, creating fundamental risks that need systematic study and mitigation.

Method: Developed BLIND-ACT benchmark with 90 tasks capturing three BGD patterns: lack of contextual reasoning, assumptions under ambiguity, and contradictory goals. Evaluated nine frontier models using LLM-based judges with 93.75% human agreement.

Result: High average BGD rate of 80.8% across all tested models. Prompting interventions reduce BGD but substantial risk persists. Identified failure modes: execution-first bias, thought-action disconnect, and request-primacy.

Conclusion: BGD exposes subtle risks even with non-harmful inputs. BLIND-ACT provides foundation for studying and mitigating this fundamental risk, highlighting need for stronger training or inference-time interventions for safe CUA deployment.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

### [224] [Improving AGI Evaluation: A Data Science Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01687)
*John Hawkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting AGI evaluation from synthetic tasks based on human intuitions to robust task execution methods inspired by data science practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGI evaluation methods are inadequate because they rely on synthetic tasks designed from human intuitions about intelligence, which have historically performed poorly in AI development.

Method: Proposes an alternative evaluation philosophy focused on demonstrating AGI through competence in robust task execution, drawing from data science practices used for reliable system deployment.

Result: The paper develops this perspective and provides practical examples of what robust AGI evaluation would entail.

Conclusion: AGI evaluation should move away from intuition-based synthetic tasks toward competence-based robust task execution methods that demonstrate reliable deployment capabilities.

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: PTA-GRPO is a two-stage framework that enhances LLM reasoning by first distilling CoT into high-level guidance through SFT, then using guidance-aware RL to jointly optimize final outputs and guidance quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning with Chain-of-Thought is constrained to local decision-making without global planning, leading to redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning that degrades performance. Existing approaches like tree-based algorithms and RL have high computational costs and fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Use advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), 2) Introduce guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes final output and high-level guidance quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC benchmarks across Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B models show PTA-GRPO achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks.

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO effectively enhances both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness in improving mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

### [226] [Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01902)
*PaweÅ Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARS is a constrained generation method that improves rejection sampling efficiency by adaptively pruning invalid continuations using a trie structure, maintaining exact distributional fidelity while increasing sample diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained generation methods either distort the LM's distribution (greedy constrained decoding) or waste computation (rejection sampling), both problematic for domains requiring both validity and diversity like program fuzzing.

Method: CARS uses unconstrained LM sampling and adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws, ensuring invalid prefixes are never revisited.

Result: CARS consistently achieves higher efficiency (fewer LM forward passes per valid sample) and produces stronger sample diversity than both greedy constrained decoding and distribution-approximating methods across various domains including program fuzzing and molecular generation.

Conclusion: CARS strictly improves rejection sampling efficiency without distributional distortion, making it suitable for applications requiring both validity and diversity in constrained generation tasks.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: While AI models achieve high accuracy on ConceptARC benchmark in text modality, their reasoning relies on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. In visual modality, accuracy drops but models still show some abstract reasoning capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art AI models truly understand and reason with the abstractions intended by ConceptARC task creators, rather than just achieving high accuracy through surface-level patterns.

Method: Evaluated models on ConceptARC under varying conditions: input modality (textual vs. visual), use of external Python tools, and reasoning effort. Performed dual evaluation measuring both output accuracy and fine-grained analysis of natural-language rules generated to explain solutions.

Result: Text-based models match human accuracy but their rules often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. Visual modality models show lower accuracy but still exhibit substantial share of rules capturing intended abstractions, though often unable to correctly apply them.

Conclusion: Models still lag humans in abstract reasoning. Accuracy alone overestimates abstract reasoning in text modality and underestimates it in visual modality. The proposed evaluation framework provides more faithful assessment of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities.

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a specialized benchmark and evaluation framework for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) to address limitations in existing assessment methods for AI agent systems that generate report-style responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating interconnected agent systems like DRAs due to deficient evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting effective assessment of their capabilities on complex tasks.

Method: Developed a rigorous benchmark with 214 expert-curated queries across 10 domains, accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles, and created a multidimensional evaluation framework with integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness.

Result: Experiments showed that mainstream DRAs outperform web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, but there is still significant room for improvement in their capabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust foundation for capability assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems, enabling more effective evaluation and development of interconnected AI agent systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces reasoning abstractions - concise natural language descriptions of procedural knowledge that guide models toward effective reasoning. It proposes RLAD, a two-player RL training paradigm that jointly trains an abstraction generator and solution generator to improve structured exploration and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning traces in large models often fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. The goal is to enable more effective reasoning by identifying and implementing algorithmic procedures rather than just pattern matching.

Method: RLAD (Reasoning with Language Abstractions and Deduction): A two-player RL training paradigm that jointly trains an abstraction generator (proposes multiple abstractions) and a solution generator (builds solutions using these abstractions). This decouples learning signals and enables structured exploration.

Result: The approach improves generalization to harder problems and enables more effective reasoning. The paper also shows that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial than generating more solutions at large test budgets.

Conclusion: Reasoning abstractions provide an effective mechanism for guiding meaningful exploration in reasoning tasks. The two-player RL setup with separate abstraction and solution generators enables structured exploration and improves the model's ability to capture and reuse procedural knowledge.

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

*Kathy Garcia,Leyla Isik*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for social video similarity and finds a modality gap where language models outperform video models in aligning with human perceptions. The authors close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer model using human behavioral data with a novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether modern AI models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos and how to instill this structure using human behavioral data, addressing the gap in pretrained video models' social recognition.

Method: Created a benchmark with 49,000+ odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 social videos. Fine-tuned TimeSformer video model using human judgments with a novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align pairwise distances with human similarity.

Result: Fine-tuned video model significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos (both explained variance and odd-one-out accuracy). The model increased shared variance with language embeddings and explained additional unique variance. Transfer tests showed improved encoding of social-affective attributes.

Conclusion: There's a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition, and behavior-guided fine-tuning can shape video representations toward human social perception, closing the modality gap between language and video models.

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it
remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity
structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture
human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this
structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we
introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on
250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality
gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align
better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap
by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our
novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning
pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields
significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in
terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance
partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance
with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured
by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find
that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective
attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the
pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video
models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning
shapes video representations toward human social perception.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: MIG-Vis uses diffusion models to visualize semantic features in neural populations, revealing structured semantic representations in higher visual cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations and whether it's organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces, addressing limitations of prior indirect methods.

Method: Uses variational autoencoder to infer disentangled neural latent subspaces, then applies mutual information-guided diffusion synthesis to visualize visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group.

Result: Identified neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content in macaque IT cortex.

Conclusion: Provides direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in higher visual cortex and advances understanding of its encoding principles.

Abstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode
object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational
neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between
artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings
are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations
themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features
from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.
This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual
information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,
and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful
subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages
the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the
visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first
uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent
subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information
(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific
visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on
multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of
two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies
neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual
features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and
intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of
structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our
understanding of its encoding principles.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based approach for generating photonic band diagrams using transformer encoders and latent diffusion models to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing photonic band diagrams requires solving Maxwell's equations across many configurations, which is numerically expensive, especially in optimization loops for inverse design.

Method: Couples a transformer encoder to extract contextual embeddings from input structures with a latent diffusion model to generate corresponding band diagrams.

Result: First approach for band diagram generation based on diffusion models with capacity to generalize to arbitrary 3D structures.

Conclusion: Transformers and diffusion models are well-suited to capture complex interference and scattering phenomena in photonics, enabling new surrogate modeling strategies.

Abstract: Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the
nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and
quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to
investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials.
However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many
configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in
optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this
challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion
models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three
dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which
extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent
diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide
insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture
the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving
the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.

Result: System successfully identified standard fetal planes from non-expert sweeps, with field evaluation showing good usability and low cognitive workload.

Conclusion: The system has potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions by assisting midwives with ultrasound acquisition.

Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings,
particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work
proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to
assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind
sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a
web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key
frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate
on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its
performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained
midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were
analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard
fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good
usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to
expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.

Motivation: Existing methods for 3D avatar creation with loose garments suffer from limited accuracy and robustness to novel animation inputs, despite progress in the field.

Method: Uses Material Point Method-based simulator tailored for garments with anisotropic constitutive model and novel collision handling, combined with canonical avatar rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art physics-based avatars in dynamics modeling accuracy, rendering accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Enables zero-shot generalization to unseen interactions.

Conclusion: MPMAvatar provides a robust framework for creating physically realistic 3D human avatars that can handle complex garment dynamics and generalize to novel scenarios.

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

*Quoc-Anh Bui,Gilles Rougeron,GÃ©raldine Morin,Simone Gasparini*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ROI-GS is an object-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that enhances local details on regions of interest while reducing model size and maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods allocate resources uniformly across scenes, limiting fine detail on objects of interest and inflating model size unnecessarily.

Method: Proposes object-guided camera selection, targeted object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object reconstructions into global scenes.

Result: Significantly improves local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), reduces model size by â17% of baseline, and achieves faster training for scenes with single objects of interest.

Conclusion: ROI-GS outperforms existing methods by prioritizing higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance and efficiency.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

### [236] [Spec-Gloss Surfels and Normal-Diffuse Priors for Relightable Glossy Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02069)
*Georgios Kouros,Minye Wu,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A relightable framework that integrates microfacet BRDF with specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects is challenging due to difficulty in disentangling shape, material properties, and illumination. Existing methods use simplified BRDF models that couple diffuse and specular components, limiting material recovery and relighting fidelity.

Method: Integrates microfacet BRDF with specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. Uses diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color to guide optimization and mitigate ambiguity. Employs coarse-to-fine optimization of environment map for convergence and HDR specular reflections.

Result: Achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction on complex glossy scenes. Delivers substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables physically consistent material decomposition and superior relighting performance for glossy objects through improved BRDF modeling and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

### [237] [Synthetic Prefixes to Mitigate Bias in Real-Time Neural Query Autocomplete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01574)
*Adithya Rajan,Xiaoyu Liu,Prateek Verma,Vibhu Arora*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A data-centric approach using synthetic prefixes from complete user queries to mitigate presentation bias in neural query autocomplete systems, improving ranking performance while maintaining real-time latency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inherent bias in engagement signals from live query autocomplete interactions where model suggestions influence user behavior, and to improve generalization in ranking models.

Method: Generate synthetic prefixes from complete user queries collected when autocomplete was inactive, enrich training data, use neural ranker with query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores, and contextual signals, and introduce O(n) listwise loss simplification for efficient training.

Result: Statistically significant improvements in user engagement metrics (mean reciprocal rank) when deployed in large-scale e-commerce setting, showing better generalization and bias mitigation.

Conclusion: Synthetic prefixes effectively mitigate presentation bias and improve neural query autocomplete systems, providing a scalable approach for bias mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks like related searches and query recommendations.

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

### [238] [Bridging Collaborative Filtering and Large Language Models with Dynamic Alignment, Multimodal Fusion and Evidence-grounded Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01606)
*Bo Ma,LuYao Liu,Simon Lau,Chandler Yuan,and XueY Cui,Rosie Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A framework that addresses limitations in LLM-based recommendation systems by enabling online adaptation, multimodal integration, and evidence-backed explanations while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in current LLM-based recommendation systems: static user preference modeling, limited multimodal content handling, and lack of trustworthy explanations.

Method: Three key innovations: online adaptation mechanism for continuous learning, unified representation combining collaborative signals with visual/audio features, and explanation system grounded in collaborative patterns and item attributes.

Result: Maintains efficiency of frozen base models with minimal computational overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses major limitations in LLM-based recommendation systems while preserving efficiency and enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

*Daniel Gwon,Nour Jedidi,Jimmy Lin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Open-source LLMs as small as 3B parameters can effectively replace proprietary LLMs for Promptagator-style query generation in dense retrieval model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Promptagator approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which may be inaccessible or prohibited for sensitive data, creating a need for accessible alternatives.

Method: Using open-source LLMs at accessible scales (â¤14B parameters) as query generators for fine-tuning domain-specialized dense retrieval models, following the Promptagator approach.

Result: Open-source LLMs as small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query generators, providing reliable alternatives for synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: This work provides practitioners with accessible alternatives for synthetic data generation and insights to maximize fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.
