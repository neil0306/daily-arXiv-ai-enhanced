Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance.

There is a lack\nof discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical\ninformation, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely\non high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the\neffectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical\ninformation (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and\nmorphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin\nTransformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS\nand CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of\nincapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures\nof galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In\nparticular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain\nmeaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable\nuncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to\nthe nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images\nmay still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise\nfor downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly\nrequired. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical\ninformation is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the\ndevelopment of image translation models for scientific use.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the effectiveness of deep learning models in preserving high-order physical information (like spectroscopic redshift) in galaxy image translation, finding limitations despite success in pixel and morphology-level reproduction.", "motivation": "To address the lack of focus on preserving complex high-order physical information in galaxy image translation, which is crucial for high-fidelity studies.", "method": "Tested four models (Swin Transformer, SRGAN, capsule network, diffusion model) on SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images to evaluate redshift preservation alongside pixel and morphology-level data.", "result": "Models struggled to retain redshift information, with cross-band peak fluxes being informative but uncertain due to many-to-many mapping.
