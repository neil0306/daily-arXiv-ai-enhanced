### [1] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 for annotating financial argument quality, comparing them to human annotations and testing for gender bias. Findings show higher LLM consistency but lingering bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing argument quality in financial communications is understudied, and LLMs offer potential for reliable, cost-effective annotations.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on the FinArgQuality dataset, tested consistency across runs, benchmarked against humans, and introduced adversarial gender bias attacks.

Result: LLMs achieved higher inter-annotator agreement than humans but showed gender bias. Temperature settings influenced stability.

Conclusion: LLMs are promising for annotations but require bias mitigation. Recommendations are provided for future research.

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

### [2] [TurQUaz at CheckThat! 2025: Debating Large Language Models for Scientific Web Discourse Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08265)
*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a council debate method using LLMs for detecting scientific content in tweets, ranking first in identifying references to scientific studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of scientific claims, references, and entities in tweets through structured LLM debates.

Method: Three debating methods (single, team, council) were explored, with council debate (multiple expert models deliberating) chosen as the primary approach.

Result: Council debate ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies but performed poorly for claims (8th) and entities (9th).

Conclusion: Council debate is effective for detecting scientific references, though improvements are needed for other categories.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

### [3] [Heartificial Intelligence: Exploring Empathy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08271)
*Victoria Williams,Benjamin Rosman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans in cognitive empathy but lag in affective empathy, making them effective for objective emotional support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess cognitive and affective empathy in language models compared to humans, given their growing role as virtual companions.

Method: Standardized psychological tests were used to evaluate cognitive and affective empathy across small and large language models.

Result: LLMs excelled in cognitive empathy, surpassing humans, but showed lower affective empathy.

Conclusion: LLMs' high cognitive empathy and low affective empathy make them ideal for consistent, unbiased emotional support without fatigue.

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

### [4] [Real-time News Story Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08272)
*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time method for identifying and grouping news articles into stories by combining text representation, clustering, and online topic modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance news monitoring systems by automatically assigning articles to specific stories based on events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity or predefined topics.

Method: Combines text representation techniques, clustering algorithms (e.g., DBStream, TextClust), and online topic modeling (e.g., BERTopic) to identify stories in real time.

Result: The approach was evaluated on a Slovene news dataset and produced sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively groups news articles into stories in real time, improving news monitoring systems.

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

### [5] [TT-XAI: Trustworthy Clinical Text Explanations via Keyword Distillation and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08273)
*Kristian Miok,Blaz Škrlj,Daniela Zaharie,Marko Robnik Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TT-XAI improves clinical language models by distilling EHRs into keywords, enhancing classifier performance and interpretability, and generating concise clinical explanations using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical language models struggle with trustworthiness and interpretability in lengthy EHRs.

Method: TT-XAI uses domain-aware keyword distillation and LLM reasoning to improve classification and explanations.

Result: Keyword distillation enhances BERT performance and explanation fidelity, while LLM-generated explanations are more clinically relevant.

Conclusion: TT-XAI provides a scalable, trustworthy solution for clinical AI, improving both machine and human interpretability.

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

### [6] [Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models: A Concept Bottleneck Model for Hate and Counter Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08274)
*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Adrian Jaques Böck,Andreas Babic,Liz Freimann,Christiane Atzmüller Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A transparent method, SCBM, uses adjective-based concepts for hate speech detection, outperforming black-box models with interpretability and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of hate speech on social media necessitates automated, interpretable detection methods.

Method: SCBM maps texts to adjective-based concepts via LLMs, then uses a classifier. It combines with transformer embeddings for better performance.

Result: SCBM achieves a 0.69 macro-F1 score, outperforming recent methods on 4/5 datasets, with a 1.8% boost from fusion.

Conclusion: Adjective-based concepts offer compact, interpretable, and effective encodings for hate speech detection, adaptable to other NLP tasks.

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

### [7] [MLLM-CBench:A Comprehensive Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning of Multimodal LLMs with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275)
*Haiyun Guo,ZhiYan Hou,Yu Chen,Jinghan He,Yandu Sun,Yuzhe Zhou,Shujing Guo,Kuan Zhu,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CTBench is a benchmark for evaluating continual instruction tuning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), featuring multidimensional evaluation, comprehensive algorithm comparison, and curated tasks. Key findings highlight model robustness, hierarchical forgetting, and algorithm dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of rigorous benchmarks for continual instruction tuning in MLLMs hinders progress. MLLM-CTBench addresses this gap by providing a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: The benchmark combines final answer accuracy with fine-grained reasoning assessment, evaluates eight continual learning algorithms, and uses 16 datasets across six domains.

Result: Findings include model robustness to forgetting, slower degradation of reasoning chains, algorithm dependency on model capability and task order, and the role of KL-divergence in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench sets a standard for continual instruction tuning and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

### [8] [Evaluating Contrast Localizer for Identifying Causal Unitsin Social & Mathematical Tasks in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08276)
*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses contrast localizers to identify causally relevant units in LLMs and VLMs for ToM and math tasks, finding unexpected results that challenge the reliability of contrast-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To pinpoint causally relevant units in large language and vision-language models for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: Contrastive stimulus sets and targeted ablations were used to localize and assess the causal role of top-activated units across 11 LLMs and 5 VLMs.

Result: Low-activation units sometimes caused larger performance drops than highly activated ones, and math-localizer units impaired ToM performance more than ToM-localizer units.

Conclusion: The findings question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and suggest the need for broader stimulus sets to better identify task-specific units.

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of subjective assessments in evaluating LLM performance, especially in high-stakes domains.

Method: Utilizes benchmarks, factual datasets, and structured pipelines for automated, transparent, and reproducible evaluations.

Result: Provides a scalable, bias-minimized solution for assessing LLM outputs across tasks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reliable and objective alternative to subjective evaluation methods in LLM performance assessment.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,
and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent,
reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

### [10] [MinionsLLM: a Task-adaptive Framework For The Training and Control of Multi-Agent Systems Through Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08283)
*Andres Garcia Rincon,Eliseo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinionsLLM integrates LLMs with Behavior Trees and Formal Grammars for natural language control of multi-agent systems, improving syntactic validity and task performance via fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural language control of multi-agent systems in user-defined environments by combining LLMs with structured frameworks.

Method: Uses Behavior Trees and Formal Grammars, introduces two synthetic dataset methods (A and B) for fine-tuning LLMs, validated on Gemma 3 models.

Result: Method B achieves 92.6% syntactic validity and 33% task performance improvement; smaller models benefit most.

Conclusion: MinionsLLM is effective for multi-agent control, especially with compact models, and is released open-source for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

### [11] [The Illusion of Progress: Re-evaluating Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08285)
*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques ROUGE for hallucination detection in LLMs, showing its low precision misaligns with human judgments. Simple heuristics can match complex methods, highlighting flawed evaluation practices. It advocates for semantically aware metrics like LLM-as-Judge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unreliability of ROUGE for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs, as it misaligns with human judgments and overestimates performance.

Method: Conducted human studies and compared ROUGE with human-aligned metrics (e.g., LLM-as-Judge). Analyzed performance of detection methods and simple heuristics.

Result: ROUGE has high recall but low precision, leading to misleading estimates. Simple heuristics rival complex methods, exposing evaluation flaws. Performance drops up to 45.9% with human-aligned metrics.

Conclusion: Semantically aware evaluation frameworks (e.g., LLM-as-Judge) are crucial for accurate hallucination detection assessment, ensuring LLM trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

### [12] [Sacred or Synthetic? Evaluating LLM Reliability and Abstention for Religious Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08287)
*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiqhQA, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' accuracy and abstention behavior in generating Islamic rulings across Sunni schools of thought in Arabic and English. GPT-4o leads in accuracy, while Gemini and Fanar excel in abstention. Performance drops in Arabic, highlighting language limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reliability and accuracy in religious domains, particularly Islamic jurisprudence, where prior work overlooks school-of-thought distinctions and abstention behavior.

Method: Zero-shot and abstention experiments on LLMs using the FiqhQA benchmark, evaluating accuracy and abstention across languages and legal schools.

Result: GPT-4o is most accurate, while Gemini and Fanar show better abstention. Performance declines in Arabic, revealing language-specific limitations.

Conclusion: Task-specific evaluation and cautious LLM deployment are crucial for religious applications due to varying performance across models, languages, and schools of thought.

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Putnam-AXIOM introduces a contamination-resilient benchmark for evaluating LLMs' mathematical reasoning using competition problems and variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks are saturated and compromised by training-set contamination, necessitating dynamic and resilient evaluation methods.

Method: Uses 522 Putnam Competition problems and 100 programmatically perturbed variants to create an unlimited, unseen test bed. Introduces Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA) for scoring reasoning traces.

Result: OpenAI's top model scored 41.9% on original problems but dropped 19.6% on variants, indicating memorization. Other models showed similar trends.

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM offers a rigorous, contamination-resilient framework for assessing LLMs' mathematical reasoning, highlighting the need for dynamic benchmarks.

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

### [14] [CoDAE: Adapting Large Language Models for Education via Chain-of-Thought Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08386)
*Shuzhou Yuan,William LaCroix,Hardik Ghoshal,Ercong Nie,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDAE enhances LLMs for educational tutoring by using Chain-of-Thought data augmentation to improve reasoning, adaptivity, and resistance to premature answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-the-shelf LLMs underperform in education by revealing answers too readily, lacking adaptivity, and being vulnerable to manipulation.

Method: CoDAE augments real-world student-tutor dialogues with Chain-of-Thought prompting, fine-tunes LLMs, and evaluates them in simulated scenarios.

Result: Fine-tuned models provide better pedagogical guidance, support reasoning, and resist premature answer disclosure.

Conclusion: CoDAE effectively adapts LLMs for educational use, addressing key limitations of off-the-shelf models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

*Jiatong Li,Weida Wang,Qinggang Zhang,Junxian Li,Di Zhang,Changmeng Zheng,Shufei Zhang,Xiaoyong Wei,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mol-R1 improves reasoning in molecule discovery by combining curated datasets and iterative training strategies for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of Long-CoT reasoning models in knowledge-intensive domains like molecule discovery.

Method: Uses PRID for dataset curation and MoIA (iterative SFT + RPO) for training.

Result: Mol-R1 outperforms existing baselines in text-based molecule generation.

Conclusion: Mol-R1 enhances explainability and reasoning in molecule discovery tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

Motivation: Resolve conflicting findings on whether morphologically aligned tokenization benefits language models, especially for morphologically complex languages.

Method: Evaluate tokenizer training, finetuning, and downstream tasks (POS tagging, NER, dependency parsing) across Telugu, Hindi, and English. Assess morphological alignment and tokenization quality.

Result: Better morphological alignment moderately improves syntax tasks, but tokenizer algorithm (BPE vs. Unigram) has a larger impact. Unigram tokenizers generally outperform, though hybrid BPE models with morphology help.

Conclusion: Morphological alignment has limited impact compared to tokenizer choice. Hybrid approaches within BPE frameworks show promise, but intrinsic metrics like CTC and Rényi entropy are not predictive.

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

*Daren Yao,Jinsong Yuan,Ruike Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes two lightweight DPO-based variants (Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero) to improve small LLM alignment with human preferences, showing notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small LLMs struggle with aligning outputs to human preferences, especially under performance gaps, necessitating lightweight solutions.

Method: Introduces margin-based objectives (Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss) and selective update mechanisms (APO-hinge-zero) for better alignment.

Result: APO-hinge-zero boosts AlpacaEval win rates (+2.0 points) and MT-Bench performance, excelling in STEM/Humanities.

Conclusion: Simple preference-based objective modifications can enhance small LLM alignment efficiently under constraints.

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

*Lorenzo Tomaz,Judd Rosenblatt,Thomas Berry Jones,Diogo Schwerz de Lucena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies hidden state changes in large language models using a physics-inspired 'energy' metric, finding it nearly constant. Training shifts models to a faster regime, and a derived control method, Jacobian steering, improves semantic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control the dynamics of hidden states in transformers for better interpretability, anomaly detection, and alignment with human intent.

Method: Analyzes 20 transformer models, introduces a physics-inspired 'energy' metric, and derives Jacobian steering for minimal hidden state perturbations.

Result: Pre-trained models show greater variability in 'energy,' while Jacobian steering improves semantic quality of outputs.

Conclusion: The physics-based approach offers a principled framework for interpretability and control, aiding model predictability and alignment.

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

*Jadie Adams,Brian Hu,Emily Veenhuis,David Joy,Bharadwaj Ravichandran,Aaron Bray,Anthony Hoogs,Arslan Basharat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a steerable pluralistic model for aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse user preferences, using few-shot comparative regression and in-context learning. It outperforms baselines and introduces new benchmarks for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods like RLHF use scalar rewards, which only reflect average user preferences. The paper aims to capture diverse preferences across multiple attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness.

Method: The approach uses few-shot comparative regression, in-context learning, and reasoning grounded in fine-grained attributes to compare responses and make aligned choices. It adapts the Moral Integrity Corpus and HelpSteer2 datasets for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating applicability to value-aligned decision-making and reward modeling.

Conclusion: The work advances pluralistic alignment, enabling fairer and more representative LLM use, and provides new research directions in ethical AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeCAL is a tokenwise compression method using a pretrained encoder-decoder model, achieving high-quality compression with minor performance dropoff up to 8x compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general-purpose compression method that maintains high-quality representations even at higher compression ratios.

Method: Uses a denoising-pretrained encoder-decoder model with small encoder modifications to maximize compression quality.

Result: Matches uncompressed performance at 2x compression and shows minor dropoff up to 8x in tasks like QA, summarization, and retrieval.

Conclusion: DeCAL provides significant savings and potential for broader applicability with further development.

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

*Sehwan Moon,Aram Lee,Jeong Eun Kim,Hee-Ju Kang,Il-Seon Shin,Sung-Wan Kim,Jae-Min Kim,Min Jhon,Ju-Wan Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DepressLLM, a large language model, improves depression prediction using interpretable methods and achieves high AUC scores, validated on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets hinders depression prediction. This study aims to address this gap with DepressLLM.

Method: DepressLLM uses a novel corpus of autobiographical narratives and a Score-guided Token Probability Summation (SToPS) module for interpretable predictions.

Result: Achieves an AUC of 0.789, rising to 0.904 for high-confidence samples. Validated on in-house and public datasets.

Conclusion: Interpretable AI like DepressLLM can aid early depression diagnosis, highlighting the potential of medical AI in psychiatry.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The review explores Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in handling Cantonese colloquial expressions. It benchmarks PEFT techniques, identifies adaptation strategies, and highlights dynamic LoRA's efficiency but notes challenges in linguistic nuance preservation and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in RAG systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi, which struggle with Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic variability.

Method: Evaluates LoRA integration in RAG frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods, and analyzes studies on LoRA variants, synthetic data, user feedback, and adaptive parameter allocation.

Result: Dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations reduce parameters without losing accuracy, but preserving linguistic nuances in low-resource settings remains difficult. User feedback integration and scalability are underdeveloped.

Conclusion: PEFT-enhanced RAG systems show promise for domain-specific tasks, but future work is needed for dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable pipelines.

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

TL;DR: InternBootcamp is an open-source framework with 1000+ diverse task environments for LLM reasoning research, featuring automated case generation and evaluation, leading to improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in LLM reasoning research by providing diverse, complex environments beyond narrow-domain benchmarks.

Method: Develop InternBootcamp with automated task generation, configurable difficulty, and verification modules, supplemented by manual validation.

Result: Frontier models underperform in many tasks, but training with InternBootcamp improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Task scaling (more training tasks) significantly enhances performance, suggesting a path to capable reasoning generalists.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

*Zheng Wu,Heyuan Huang,Yanjia Yang,Yuanyi Song,Xingyu Lou,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Jun Wang,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFRAgent, a framework to enhance mobile-use agents by aligning explicit and implicit human intentions, improving task automation on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile-use agents focus only on explicit human intentions (e.g., step sequences), neglecting implicit ones (e.g., preferences), limiting personalization.

Method: IFRAgent uses intention flow recognition to analyze explicit and implicit human intentions, creating a SOP library and habit repository, then employs retrieval-augmented generation for personalized queries.

Result: IFRAgent improves human intention alignment by 6.79% (32.06% relative) and step completion by 5.30% (26.34% relative) over baselines.

Conclusion: IFRAgent effectively bridges the gap between mobile-use agents and human intent, enhancing personalization and task automation.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of fine-tuned LLMs for ABSA tasks, focusing on LLaMA-based models.

Method: Evaluate fine-tuned open-source LLMs (including Orca~2) on four ABSA tasks across eight English datasets.

Result: Fine-tuned Orca~2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, but models perform poorly in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs for ABSA is effective, but challenges remain in low-resource settings.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their
performance in compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks lags
behind fine-tuned models. However, the potential of LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA
remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs
fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the
performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the
fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks.
However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify
challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

Motivation: To address the challenge of cross-lingual emotion detection and trigger word prediction in tweets across multiple languages.

Method: Fine-tuning quantized large language models (Orca~2) with LoRA and multilingual Transformer models (XLM-R, mT5), enhanced by machine translation and trigger word switching.

Result: Ranked 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates strong performance in cross-lingual emotion and trigger word detection, leveraging advanced fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents our system built for the WASSA-2024 Cross-lingual Emotion
Detection Shared Task. The task consists of two subtasks: first, to assess an
emotion label from six possible classes for a given tweet in one of five
languages, and second, to predict words triggering the detected emotions in
binary and numerical formats. Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning
quantized large language models, specifically Orca~2, with low-rank adapters
(LoRA) and multilingual Transformer-based models, such as XLM-R and mT5. We
enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger
word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent
performance, ranking 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary
trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.

Motivation: To address the lack of prompt-based methods for aspect-based sentiment analysis and sentiment classification in Czech, and to explore their effectiveness compared to traditional fine-tuning.

Method: Uses sequence-to-sequence models with prompt-based approaches for aspect-based tasks, and evaluates zero-shot and few-shot learning for sentiment classification.

Result: Prompting outperforms traditional fine-tuning, especially with limited training data, and pre-training on target domain data improves zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Prompt-based methods are effective for sentiment tasks in Czech, offering better performance with limited data and benefiting from domain-specific pre-training.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first prompt-based methods for aspect-based
sentiment analysis and sentiment classification in Czech. We employ the
sequence-to-sequence models to solve the aspect-based tasks simultaneously and
demonstrate the superiority of our prompt-based approach over traditional
fine-tuning. In addition, we conduct zero-shot and few-shot learning
experiments for sentiment classification and show that prompting yields
significantly better results with limited training examples compared to
traditional fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that pre-training on data from the
target domain can lead to significant improvements in a zero-shot scenario.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system for text-to-table generation using LLMs, employing task decomposition and iterative self-feedback to improve quality and address challenges like ambiguity and structure maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured text-to-structured data conversion is complex, and LLMs often struggle with ambiguity, domain-specific data, and maintaining structure. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The system uses novel prompting techniques, breaking the task into guided sub-tasks and refining tables through iterative self-feedback.

Result: The method outperforms baselines on two public datasets, demonstrating improved table generation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances text-to-table generation but involves trade-offs between performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

TL;DR: LLMs perform well in high-resource language translation but lag in low-resource languages. TopXGen generates high-quality, diverse data for low-resource languages to improve translation via backtranslation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of LLMs in low-resource language translation by creating high-quality, topic-diverse data.

Method: TopXGen uses LLMs to generate target-side texts in low-resource languages, which are then backtranslated for parallel data creation.

Result: TopXGen improves LLM translation performance in low-resource languages for both fine-tuning and in-context learning.

Conclusion: TopXGen effectively enhances LLM translation in low-resource languages by leveraging synthetic data generation.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

TL;DR: The study evaluates ASR models for older Dutch adults using the Welzijn.AI chatbot, finding generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned ones and suggesting truncation helps balance accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliable ASR for underrepresented groups like older Dutch adults in clinical contexts.

Method: Benchmarking generic multilingual ASR models and fine-tuned models for Dutch spoken by older adults, considering processing speed.

Result: Generic multilingual models outperformed fine-tuned ones, indicating good generalization. Truncation balanced accuracy and speed, though some cases had high WER due to hallucinations.

Conclusion: Recent ASR models generalize well without fine-tuning, and truncation can optimize performance, but hallucinations remain a challenge.

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

### [32] [IROTE: Human-like Traits Elicitation of Large Language Model via In-Context Self-Reflective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08719)
*Yuzhuo Bai,Shitong Duan,Muhua Huang,Jing Yao,Zhenghao Liu,Peng Zhang,Tun Lu,Xiaoyuan Yi,Maosong Sun,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IROTE is a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait elicitation in LLMs, addressing superficial mimicry by generating optimized self-reflection prompts based on psychological theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trait elicitation in LLMs are superficial and unstable, failing to consistently embody desired traits across tasks.

Method: IROTE generates and optimizes textual self-reflection prompts using an information-theoretic objective, enhancing trait-driven behavior without fine-tuning.

Result: IROTE outperforms baselines, enabling stable impersonation of target traits across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: IROTE effectively addresses the superficial elicitation problem, offering a robust method for trait-driven LLM behavior.

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

*Weibin Liao,Tianlong Wang,Yinghao Zhu,Yasha Wang,Junyi Gao,Liantao Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture, improves semantic fidelity and lay-style diversity in Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) by using shared and isolated matrices with constraints and switches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA struggles with semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in MLLG due to multi-source heterogeneous datasets.

Method: Proposes Magical: shared matrix A for summarization, isolated matrices B for lay-style diversity, Semantic Invariance Constraint, and Recommendation-guided Switch.

Result: Outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and variants, reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Conclusion: Magical effectively addresses LoRA's limitations in MLLG, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciRerankBench, a benchmark for evaluating rerankers in RAG-LLMs, focusing on noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency across five scientific subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific literature question answering is crucial for discoveries, but existing two-stage RAG-LLMs lack exploration of reranker potential and limitations.

Method: Develops SciRerankBench with three Q-C-A pair types (NC, SSLI, CC) to evaluate 13 rerankers on five LLM families.

Result: Provides insights into reranker strengths and limitations, offering guidance for future development.

Conclusion: SciRerankBench is the first benchmark for rerankers in RAG-LLMs, advancing their evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

TL;DR: DevNous, an LLM-based multi-agent system, automates translating unstructured team dialogue into structured IT project governance artifacts, achieving high accuracy on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual translation of unstructured dialogue into structured artifacts is a bottleneck in IT project governance, necessitating automation.

Method: DevNous integrates into team chats, identifies actionable intents, and manages workflows for tasks like task formalization and progress summaries.

Result: DevNous achieves 81.3% exact match accuracy and 0.845 F1-Score on a new benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The work presents a validated architectural pattern for administrative agents and introduces a public benchmark for the domain.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

### [36] [Privacy-protected Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08785)
*Yunfeng Ning,Mayi Xu,Jintao Wen,Qiankun Pi,Yuanyuan Zhu,Ming Zhong,Jiawei Jiang,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARoG, a privacy-protected RAG framework addressing LLM hallucinations and outdated knowledge by anonymizing KG entities and using abstraction strategies for retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face issues like hallucinations and outdated knowledge. RAG integrates external knowledge but poses privacy risks with private KGs. This paper explores privacy-protected RAG where KG entities are anonymous.

Method: Proposes ARoG with two strategies: relation-centric abstraction (converts anonymous entities into retrievable info) and structure-oriented abstraction (retrieves question-relevant anonymous entities).

Result: ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness on three datasets.

Conclusion: ARoG effectively addresses privacy risks in RAG systems while maintaining retrieval performance.

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an automated pipeline for creating training environments and a verifiable reward mechanism to enhance LLMs' tool-use performance via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of efficient RL frameworks for tool use in LLMs due to challenges in stable training environments and verifiable rewards.

Method: Introduces an automated environment construction pipeline (scenario decomposition, document generation, etc.) and a verifiable reward mechanism for precision and completeness.

Result: Significantly improves LLMs' tool-use performance without degrading general capabilities, attributed to better context understanding and reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances LLMs' tool-use abilities through improved training environments and reward mechanisms.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

*Robin Faro,Dongyang Fan,Tamar Alphaidze,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiMoE introduces a time-aware mixture of language experts to prevent temporal leakage in LLMs by training on disjoint time slices and masking future-knowledge experts during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of stale knowledge and temporal leakage in LLMs by ensuring predictions rely only on past information relative to the query.

Method: Pre-train GPT-style experts on disjoint two-year slices (2013-2024) and combine them using TiMoE, which masks experts with future knowledge during inference.

Result: TiMoE matches or exceeds single-period expert performance on NLP tasks and reduces future-knowledge errors by up to 15%.

Conclusion: Modular, time-segmented pre-training with causal routing effectively grounds LLMs chronologically without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new framework evaluates LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by testing them on linguistically and parametrically varied, mathematically equivalent problems, revealing performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' sensitivity to non-mathematical perturbations and improve evaluation of their mathematical reasoning.

Method: Created PutnamGAP, a benchmark dataset with varied math problems, and tested 18 LLMs on it.

Result: Performance degraded sharply on variants; OpenAI's O3 dropped by 4-10.5 percentage points.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively deepens understanding of LLMs' robustness and guides improvements in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs encoding and reproducing ideological biases, particularly in political and economic dimensions.

Method: Uses contrastive pairs to analyze hidden layer activations in models like Mistral and DeepSeek, with a layer-wise extraction pipeline.

Result: Decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, enabling steering vector-based mitigation.

Conclusion: Provides insights into political bias encoding in LLMs and a principled debiasing approach beyond surface-level interventions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

TL;DR: BiasGym is a framework for injecting, analyzing, and mitigating biases in LLMs, using BiasInject for bias injection and BiasScope for identification and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating subtle biases in LLMs is challenging but crucial for fairness and interpretability.

Method: BiasGym uses BiasInject to inject biases via token-based fine-tuning and BiasScope to analyze and mitigate them.

Result: The framework effectively reduces real-world stereotypes and probes fictional associations without degrading downstream task performance.

Conclusion: BiasGym is a versatile tool for bias analysis and mitigation in LLMs, useful for safety and interpretability research.

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

*Kaiyu Wang,Lin Mu,Zhiyao Yang,Ximing Li,Xiaotang Zhou Wanfu Gao,Huimao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sqator automates QA scoring for radiology reports by analyzing fine-grained text spans, reducing labor costs and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual QA scoring for radiology reports is labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracies due to biases and variability among senior doctors.

Method: Sqator measures QA scores by evaluating the importance of revised text spans between junior and senior reports, merging these for final scores.

Result: Sqator achieves competitive QA scores on 12,013 radiology reports, with revised span importance aligning with senior doctors' judgments.

Conclusion: Sqator offers an efficient and accurate automated solution for QA scoring in radiology reports.

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Culturescope, a method to analyze cultural biases in LLMs by probing their internal representations, revealing Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs' internal mechanisms lead to cultural misrepresentation, addressing gaps in prior extrinsic evaluations.

Method: Culturescope uses mechanistic interpretability and a patching method to extract cultural knowledge, introducing a cultural flattening score.

Result: LLMs exhibit Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, with low-resource cultures less affected due to limited training data.

Conclusion: The work lays groundwork for mitigating cultural biases and improving LLMs' cultural understanding, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

TL;DR: ASPD introduces parallel decoding for LLMs, improving speed by up to 3.19x without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inference latency in LLMs due to sequential token prediction by leveraging parallelizable structures.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD) with a non-invasive pipeline for extracting parallelizable data and a Hybrid Decoding Engine for efficient transitions between serial and parallel modes.

Result: Achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x avg) on Vicuna Bench with <1% quality difference.

Conclusion: ASPD sets a benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, enabling deployment in latency-sensitive applications.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate ASR for low-resource languages like Arabic is challenging due to limited labeled data and linguistic complexity from diverse dialects.

Method: Pretrain on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech (MSA and DA), then fine-tune with filtered weakly labeled data and a small high-quality dataset.

Result: Ranked first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge, demonstrating effectiveness in overcoming data scarcity.

Conclusion: Weak supervision paired with fine-tuning is effective for high-quality ASR in low-resource, dialect-rich languages.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Conclusion: Reasoning steps impact predictions differently across models and languages, highlighting challenges for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning in LLMs using GRPO, outperforming fixed-budget methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed-length training budgets don't leverage the natural learning progression from exploration to compression.

Method: Uses GRPO with a curriculum learning approach, starting with generous token budgets and gradually tightening them. Balances task correctness, length efficiency, and formatting adherence via a reward function.

Result: Outperforms fixed-budget baselines in accuracy and token efficiency across multiple datasets (GSM8K, MATH500, etc.).

Conclusion: Progressive constraint via curriculum learning is effective for training efficient reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoDIT improves LLM trustworthiness by jointly generating and attributing answers in RAG using token logits, outperforming SOTA models with efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM hallucination and improve faithfulness in answer attribution by aligning token generation with attribution generation.

Method: LoDIT marks documents with token identifiers, leverages logits to estimate document contributions, and aggregates them into attributions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on Trust-Align benchmark, showing efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: LoDIT effectively enhances LLM trustworthiness with minimal latency, offering a robust solution for faithful attribution.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

*Seonghwan Choi,Beomseok Kang,Dongwon Jo,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetroAttention improves KV cache efficiency in LLMs by revising past attention outputs with new data, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and errors in KV cache during long-context tasks in LLMs.

Method: Introduces RetroAttention, a technique to update KV cache retrospectively using new decoding data.

Result: Increases effective KV exposure by 1.6× and accuracy by 21.9% over SOTA methods.

Conclusion: RetroAttention enhances LLM performance in long-context tasks by dynamically correcting attention outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

TL;DR: Zero-shot pipeline using LLM for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33/53 without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore zero-shot code generation for Tabular Question Answering without task-specific training.

Method: Modular pipeline with LLM-generated code, column relevance identification, data type analysis, and iterative refinement.

Result: Ranked 33 out of 53 in SemEval 2025 Task 8, demonstrating viability of zero-shot approach.

Conclusion: Zero-shot code generation is effective for Tabular QA, though iterative refinement improves robustness.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews training-free (TF) alignment methods for large language models (LLMs), categorizing them into pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding stages, and discusses their mechanisms, limitations, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional fine-tuning methods, such as resource intensity and knowledge degradation, by exploring TF alignment techniques that adapt to diverse environments without heavy retraining.

Method: Systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorized by pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding stages, with analysis of mechanisms and limitations for LLMs and multimodal LLMs.

Result: Identifies key challenges and future directions for TF alignment, providing a structured overview of current research.

Conclusion: The survey guides practitioners and promotes the development of safer, more reliable LLMs through inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

*Chen Xu,Zhenyu Lv,Tian Lan,Xianyang Wang,Luyao Ji,Leyang Cui,Minqiang Yang,Jian Shen,Qunxi Dong,Xiuling Liu,Juan Wang,Bin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs as supervisors to train therapists by focusing on identifying and correcting common therapeutic mistakes, rather than defining absolute standards for correct behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct use of LLMs in psychotherapy raises ethical and safety concerns, so the work shifts to training therapists using LLMs as supervisors. The lack of absolute standards for therapeutic behavior complicates training, but common mistakes are identifiable and can serve as clear feedback triggers.

Method: A novel training paradigm is introduced: (1) guidelines for mistakes and corrections are established, (2) a human-in-the-loop dataset is created where a mistake-prone agent makes standard mistakes and a supervisor provides feedback, (3) the supervisor model is fine-tuned on this dataset (MATE) for real therapist training.

Result: Experiments show that models fine-tuned on MATE provide high-quality feedback aligned with clinical guidelines, demonstrating potential for therapist training.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages LLMs for therapist training by focusing on mistake identification and correction, offering a practical and ethical solution.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

TL;DR: MVISU-Bench is a bilingual benchmark with 404 tasks across 137 apps, addressing real-world user needs. Aider, a plug-and-play module, improves success rates by 19.55%, especially for unethical and interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to address real-world user needs, prompting the creation of MVISU-Bench to evaluate mobile agents more effectively.

Method: Developed MVISU-Bench with 404 tasks across 137 apps and introduced Aider, a dynamic prompt prompter, to clarify user intent.

Result: Aider improved success rates by 19.55%, with significant gains in unethical (53.52%) and interactive (29.41%) tasks.

Conclusion: MVISU-Bench and Aider highlight the gap between current mobile agents and real-world expectations, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

TL;DR: READER is a novel speculative decoding method for LLMs that leverages self-repetitions and statistical search to speed up inference without additional training, achieving over 40% speedup and 10x in retrieval-augmented tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sequential nature of LLM inference is hard to accelerate, posing deployment challenges. Existing methods often require training draft models, which READER avoids.

Method: READER uses retrieval-assisted speculative decoding, expanding the decoding tree with tokens from statistical search and optimizing KV cache for large batches.

Result: READER outperforms existing methods, achieving >40% speedup and >10x in retrieval-augmented tasks, with no extra training.

Conclusion: READER is a lossless, efficient solution for LLM inference, especially effective in large-batch and retrieval-augmented scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

*Xinge Ye,Rui Wang,Yuchuan Wu,Victor Ma,Feiteng Fang,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO) and CharacterArena to address challenges in RLFT for subjective tasks like role-playing dialogue, improving evaluation robustness and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward modeling struggles with subjective tasks due to unstable signals and evaluation criteria. Human evaluation combines explicit and implicit judgments, inspiring CPO.

Method: CPO shifts from sample-wise to group-wise comparative scoring. CharacterArena uses contextualized multi-turn simulation and trajectory-level comparisons for fair evaluation.

Result: CPO reduces reward ambiguity and improves dialogue quality, validated on CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena.

Conclusion: CPO and CharacterArena offer a more robust approach for RLFT in subjective tasks, enhancing evaluation fairness and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

TL;DR: A novel architecture improves multilingual LLM performance by fusing all intermediate layers of multilingual encoders, outperforming baselines on low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly on low-resource languages due to English-centric training. Existing methods like LangBridge underutilize encoder layers.

Method: Proposes fusing all intermediate layers using Global Softmax and Transformer Softmax strategies, mapping representations into LLM's embedding space.

Result: Significant improvements in low-resource languages (e.g., Sinhala accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86%) and overall XNLI accuracy (70.36% to 71.50%).

Conclusion: The approach is scalable and data-efficient, enhancing multilingual LLM capabilities without parallel or multilingual data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses fragmented event logs in the process industry by adapting cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) with NLP techniques, outperforming baselines by 27-28%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented shift logs hinder knowledge management (KM) by disconnecting related records, limiting solution recommendations.

Method: Proposes a record linking (RL) model using CDCR, enhanced with natural language inference (NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS), adapted for the process industry.

Result: The RL model outperformed NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 27-28% (11.21-11.43 points).

Conclusion: Domain adaptation of CDCR with reasoning capabilities improves shift log connectivity and data quality in the process industry.

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

TL;DR: AutoCodeGen automates multilingual code generation dataset creation, addressing limitations of manual benchmarks. AutoCodeBench evaluates LLMs on diverse, challenging tasks, revealing their struggles with complexity and multilingualism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM code generation are limited by manual annotations, Python focus, and uneven language distribution. AutoCodeGen aims to overcome these issues with automation and multilingual diversity.

Method: AutoCodeGen uses LLMs to generate test inputs and a multilingual sandbox for outputs, ensuring correctness. It employs reverse-order problem generation and filtering for high-quality datasets.

Result: AutoCodeBench, with 3,920 problems across 20 languages, shows advanced LLMs struggle with complexity and multilingual tasks. AutoCodeBench-Complete assesses few-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench provides a scalable, high-quality benchmark for challenging multilingual code generation, inspiring focus on practical scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Motivation: Low-resource languages like Sinhala are often neglected by open-source LLMs.

Method: Enhanced tokenizer with Sinhala vocabulary and continual pre-training on a 10M Sinhala corpus.

Result: SinLlama outperforms base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B in text classification.

Conclusion: SinLlama is the first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support, showing significant improvement.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: OdysseyBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows in office applications, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks focused on atomic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture long-term dependencies and multi-interaction coordination needed in real-world scenarios.

Method: OdysseyBench includes two splits (OdysseyBench+ and OdysseyBench-Neo) with tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. HomerAgents automates benchmark generation.

Result: OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing a more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex contexts.

Conclusion: OdysseyBench is a valuable resource for advancing LLM agent development and evaluation in real-world productivity scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Method: Proposes LogicIFGen, a framework for generating verifiable logic-rich instructions from code functions, and LogicIFEval, a benchmark of 426 such instructions.

Result: Current LLMs struggle, following fewer than 60% of instructions, highlighting deficiencies in logic-rich instruction-following.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in handling complex logic in instructions, with LogicIFEval serving as a benchmark for future advancements.

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

*Wen Wang,Bozhen Fang,Chenchen Jing,Yongliang Shen,Yangyi Shen,Qiuyu Wang,Hao Ouyang,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to exploit temporal consistency in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to improve text generation by addressing the issue of temporal oscillation, where correct answers are overwritten in later steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoding strategies in dLLMs discard intermediate predictions, missing correct answers that emerge mid-process.

Method: Two methods are proposed: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting (training-free) and 2) Temporal Consistency Reinforcement (post-training using Temporal Semantic Entropy as a reward).

Result: Significant improvements are observed: 24.7% on Countdown, and gains of 2.0% (GSM8K), 4.3% (MATH500), 6.6% (SVAMP), and 25.3% (Countdown).

Conclusion: Temporal dynamics in dLLMs hold untapped potential, and the proposed methods effectively harness them for better performance.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

### [64] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI is a framework for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by combining functional motif sequences with global molecular image features, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDI prediction methods are limited by motif-based representation learning, missing global structural insights. ImageDDI aims to integrate both local (motif) and global (image) features for better accuracy.

Method: ImageDDI tokenizes molecules into functional motifs, embeds them using a transformer, and enhances representation with global molecular image features (e.g., texture, color) via Adaptive Feature Fusion.

Result: ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets and shows competitive performance in 2D and 3D image-enhanced scenarios.

Conclusion: ImageDDI effectively combines motif and image features for superior DDI prediction, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

*Christophe EL Zeinaty,Wassim Hamidouche,Glenn Herrou,Daniel Menard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper analyzes optimization techniques for deploying object detection models on resource-constrained IoT devices using TinyML, addressing gaps in existing literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of IoT devices and their limited computational resources necessitate efficient object detection solutions, which current surveys often overlook.

Method: The paper reviews key optimization techniques like quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search, comparing theoretical and practical approaches.

Result: It evaluates KPIs of existing implementations on microcontrollers, showcasing their maturity in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The survey bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment, offering a public repository for ongoing updates in this evolving field.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A task- and hardware-agnostic pipeline improves Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) by addressing accuracy gaps and simulation-fabrication discrepancies, using Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD) for training and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid ONNs are energy-efficient but face accuracy gaps and hardware discrepancies, limiting adoption.

Method: Proposes a pipeline with pre-training accuracy estimation and NTKD for aligning optical models with digital networks, plus post-fabrication fine-tuning.

Result: Improves ONN performance across datasets and hardware, enabling practical deployment.

Conclusion: The pipeline enhances ONN accuracy and generalizability, making them viable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS is a multi-agent framework for long-sequence video storytelling, addressing limitations like poor assistive capability and visual quality by orchestrating specialized agents across stages like script writing and video animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current long-sequence video generation frameworks, such as poor assistive capability and suboptimal visual quality.

Method: MAViS uses a multi-agent collaborative approach, following the 3E Principle (Explore, Examine, Enhance) across stages like script writing, shot designing, and video animation. It also employs Script Writing Guidelines for compatibility.

Result: MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and expressiveness, producing high-quality, expressive videos with narratives and background music.

Conclusion: MAViS is a scalable, modular framework that enhances creativity and inspiration for users, uniquely offering multimodal design outputs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON is a unified multi-garment diffusion framework for virtual try-on, preserving identity and garment fidelity by jointly modeling upper/lower garments and person identity in a shared latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods handle garments separately, require heavy preprocessing, and fail to preserve person-specific cues like tattoos and body shape, limiting realism and flexibility.

Method: MuGa-VTON uses three modules: Garment Representation Module (GRM) for garment semantics, Person Representation Module (PRM) for identity/pose cues, and A-DiT fusion module integrating features via diffusion transformer. Supports prompt-based customization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on VITON-HD and DressCode benchmarks, producing high-fidelity, identity-preserving results.

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON offers a practical solution for real-world virtual try-on applications with improved realism and flexibility.

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CObL is a diffusion-based architecture that infers an occlusion-ordered stack of object layers from images, generalizing to real-world scenes without prior knowledge of object count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve vision by grouping pixels into objects and understanding their spatial relationships, including depth and occlusion.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based architecture (CObL) with Stable Diffusion as a prior and inference-time guidance to ensure layers composite back to the input image. Trained on synthetic multi-object tabletop scenes.

Result: Zero-shot generalization to real-world tabletop photos with novel objects, reconstructing multiple occluded objects without user input or prior knowledge of object count.

Conclusion: CObL advances unsupervised object-centric representation learning by handling real-world scenes beyond its training domain.

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current VLMs excel at single-panel recognition but fail in temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion for sequential storytelling. A new evaluation framework reveals these gaps, showing models struggle with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in VLMs' ability to understand deep narrative reasoning in sequential visual storytelling, particularly in manga.

Method: Introduces a framework with fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment. Evaluated on Re:Zero manga with 308 panels across 11 chapters.

Result: VLMs lack story-level intelligence, failing in non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for evaluating narrative intelligence in VLMs and highlights limitations in deep sequential understanding.

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR introduces a novel method for controlling Vision Language Models (VLMs) using optimized visual inputs, achieving robust behavioral control without model access or runtime overhead, while exposing a security vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for VLM behavioral control are detectable, ineffective, or require invasive model access, prompting the need for a practical and imperceptible solution.

Method: VISOR crafts universal steering images to induce target activation patterns, enabling control without textual instructions or model internals.

Result: VISOR matches or exceeds steering vector performance (1-25% shifts) and outperforms system prompting (3-4% shifts), while maintaining high performance on unrelated tasks.

Conclusion: VISOR redefines multimodal model control, demonstrating the potential for visual steering attacks and highlighting the need for new defenses.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve OCR for historical Kindai documents by using parallel textline images and a distance-based objective function, reducing error rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcribing Kindai documents is labor-intensive, and limited annotated data hinders OCR training. The research aims to address data scarcity.

Method: Leverages parallel textline images (original and contemporary fonts) and introduces a distance-based objective function (Euclidean distance and MMD) for domain adaptation.

Result: Reduces character error rate (CER) by 2.23% (Euclidean) and 3.94% (MMD) over a Transformer-based OCR baseline. Improves self-attention representations.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances OCR performance for historical documents by mitigating data scarcity and improving feature discriminability.

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn introduces a per-instance temperature scaling method for Vision Transformers, reducing calibration error by up to 4x with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probability calibration is crucial for risk-sensitive applications, but standard methods like temperature scaling are limited by global scalar use and require validation sets.

Method: CalAttn learns adaptive, per-instance temperatures directly from the ViT's CLS token, avoiding the need for a validation set.

Result: CalAttn reduces calibration error by up to 4x on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K) with under 0.1% additional parameters.

Conclusion: CalAttn is a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic solution for trustworthy probabilities without accuracy loss.

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generic framework (DTLP-Net) is proposed to address semi-supervised medical image segmentation challenges, leveraging diverse teacher models and label propagation for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional methods in handling limited annotation and domain shift in medical image segmentation.

Method: Uses DTLP-Net with a student model and two diverse teacher models, employing inter- and intra-sample augmentation and label propagation.

Result: Achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in semi-supervised medical image segmentation and shows potential for broader SSL applications.

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET addresses gaps in blind face restoration (BFR) by switching between Restoration and Degradation modes, outperforming prior methods in authenticity and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between vanilla diffusion models and BFR settings, due to discrepancies in image quality and synthesis vs. real-world images, hinders effective adaptation.

Method: FLIPNET uses a unified network with two modes: Restoration for integrating BFR features and Degradation for synthesizing realistic degraded images.

Result: FLIPNET outperforms previous BFR methods in authenticity and fidelity and improves real-world degradation modeling.

Conclusion: FLIPNET effectively bridges the gap in BFR by leveraging dual modes, enhancing restoration and degradation synthesis.

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

*Tuo Liu,Qinghan Yang,Yu Zhang,Rongjun Ge,Yang Chen,Guangquan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSAME combines SAM's visual understanding with segmentation and landmark localization for LV measurements, introducing FCBA and SGPA to enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms struggle with small datasets and lack anatomical point identification, critical for LV measurements.

Method: Proposes AutoSAME, integrating SAM for segmentation and landmark tasks, with FCBA for feature enhancement and SGPA for spatial-guided prompts.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements on an echocardiography dataset.

Conclusion: AutoSAME effectively mimics sonographers, aligning with clinical guidelines for LV measurements.

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

*Chenruo Liu,Hongjun Liu,Zeyu Lai,Yiqiu Shen,Chen Zhao,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using superclass information and gradient-based attention to reduce reliance on spurious features, improving robustness without auxiliary annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require impractical auxiliary annotations and assume identical group sets across domains, which are unrealistic.

Method: Leverages superclass labels and gradient-based attention guided by a vision-language model to disentangle features, promoting superclass-relevant features for prediction.

Result: Outperforms baselines in domain generalization, with improvements in metrics and visualizations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances robustness to spurious correlations without needing source sample annotations.

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

*Jingyun Liang,Jingkai Zhou,Shikai Li,Chenjie Cao,Lei Sun,Yichen Qian,Weihua Chen,Fan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating realistic human videos with separate control over foreground, background, trajectory, and action, using 3D motion editing and text-to-video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack separate control over key video elements (foreground, background, trajectory, action), limiting flexibility in video generation.

Method: Decomposes motion control by editing in 3D space, using trajectory unprojection and motion banks, and integrates with text-to-video diffusion models for synthesis.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllability and video quality on benchmarks and real-world cases.

Conclusion: The framework enables flexible, realistic video generation with precise control over all elements.

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

*Wenwen Yu,Zhibo Yang,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocThinker is a rule-based RL framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning in MLLMs, improving explainability and adaptability over fixed CoT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack transparency and reliability in reasoning, especially in high-stakes domains, due to black-box processes and limitations of fixed CoT methods.

Method: DocThinker uses RL with multi-objective rule-based rewards and KL-constrained optimization to refine reasoning strategies dynamically, generating explainable intermediate results.

Result: Experiments show DocThinker enhances generalization, explainability, and adaptability in document understanding tasks.

Conclusion: RL is a promising approach for improving transparency and adaptability in MLLM-based document understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

*Yuxiao Wang,Wolin Liang,Yu Lei,Weiying Xue,Nan Zhuang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QueryCraft improves HOI detection by using semantic priors and guided feature learning via transformer-based query initialization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based HOI detection methods lack explicit semantics in queries, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes QueryCraft with ACTOR (cross-modal Transformer) for action-relevant features and PDQD for object-level query enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks.

Conclusion: QueryCraft's dual-branch query initialization enhances interpretability and effectiveness in HOI detection.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance interactive video generation by combining simulation, generation, and editing into a unified AI-driven paradigm for creative tools and media.

Method: Uses a 3D-VAE for real-time simulation, hierarchical autoregressive captioning for multi-modal generation, and a hybrid model for disentangled editing.

Result: Achieves real-time 1080P/60FPS simulation, flexible domain blending, and text-based multi-granularity editing.

Conclusion: Yan integrates these capabilities to pioneer a comprehensive AI-driven interactive video creation framework.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransMiter is a lightweight adapter for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that transfers adaptation knowledge without backpropagation, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large VLMs is costly, and existing adaptation transfer methods lack transferability and efficiency.

Method: TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs in an unsupervised manner, requiring minimal layers and no backpropagation.

Result: TransMiter efficiently transfers knowledge across VLMs, often outperforming fine-tuned models with negligible inference cost.

Conclusion: TransMiter is a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing VLMs without compromising generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised method for handheld video deblurring using sharp clues in videos, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the blur domain gap in real-world handheld videos, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Extracts sharp clues as labels, uses SEVD for better data, and SCSCM for consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing self-supervised methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for handheld video deblurring, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/cshonglei/SelfHVD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining neural artistic style transfer with color transfer, evaluated using KL divergence for histogram matching algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance artistic expression and image correction by merging neural style transfer with color transfer techniques.

Method: Uses KL divergence to evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms (Reinhard, IDT, Cholesky, PCA) on neural style-transferred images.

Result: Experiments assess KL divergence and color histograms for style-to-content transfer effectiveness.

Conclusion: The combined approach improves artistic visuals and image correction, validated by quantitative evaluation.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model to address catastrophic forgetting in Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) by leveraging frame-level and video-level prompts and modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIS approaches assume fixed object categories and suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes. The HVPL model aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The HVPL model uses a task-specific frame prompt with an Orthogonal Gradient Correction (OGC) module for frame-level mitigation and a task-specific video prompt with a video context decoder for video-level mitigation.

Result: The HVPL model outperforms baseline approaches in preventing catastrophic forgetting and handling dynamic object categories.

Conclusion: The HVPL model effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in VIS by combining frame-level and video-level strategies, offering a robust solution for continuous learning of new object categories.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

TL;DR: The paper proposes AME, a method for robust vision-language knowledge distillation under low-data regimes by minimizing entropy over a shared manifold, improving generalization without modifying backbone architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust knowledge distillation in vision-language models with limited training data, especially for ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations.

Method: AME minimizes entropy over a reconfigured shared manifold using projection functions to bridge multi-modal data, enabling structural compression for cross-modal features.

Result: AME achieves superior generalization across diverse distillation architectures and tasks, with theoretical support for tighter error bounds.

Conclusion: AME is a plug-and-play solution for robust vision-language distillation, effective in low-data scenarios and compatible with various frameworks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: A unified framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in medical image segmentation, supporting both source-accessible and source-free settings by learning a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold of anatomical regularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a structured, generalizable anatomical knowledge construction in prior domain adaptation methods, which are tailored to either source-accessible or source-free settings.

Method: Introduces a model that learns a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold representing anatomical regularities, enabling disentangled and interpretable predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both source-accessible and source-free settings, with high consistency between them, and demonstrates strong interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a semantically grounded, adaptable solution for domain adaptation in medical image segmentation, bridging the gap between source-accessible and source-free approaches.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiWL is a two-stage deep image watermarking method that improves invisibility, robustness, and broad applicability, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep image watermarking methods struggle to simultaneously meet invisibility, robustness, and broad applicability criteria.

Method: HiWL uses a two-stage approach: 1) distribution alignment learning for visual consistency and information invariance, and 2) generalized watermark representation learning to disentangle watermarks from image content.

Result: HiWL achieves 7.6% higher watermark extraction accuracy and processes 100K images in 8s, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: HiWL effectively addresses the limitations of current methods, offering a generalizable and efficient solution for deep image watermarking.

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Motivation: To enhance medical diagnosis by integrating unique and complementary information from different modalities into a comprehensive image.

Method: Uses an Invertible Dense Network (IDN) for lossless feature extraction and a Multi-scale Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) with hybrid attention, convolutional layers, and Transformers. Introduces an adaptive loss function.

Result: Outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies confirm component effectiveness.

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN is effective for medical image fusion and shows promise for other fusion tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

Motivation: Ultrasound deformable registration is challenging due to low contrast, noise, and ambiguous tissue boundaries, leading to poor alignment in existing methods.

Method: PADReg constructs a stiffness map using contact force and ultrasound data, then estimates deformation fields with a physics-aware module inspired by Hooke's law.

Result: Achieves a 21.34% improvement in HD95 (12.90) over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PADReg enhances registration accuracy and anatomical alignment by incorporating physical priors, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

*Tong Sun,Hongliang Ye,Jilin Mei,Liang Chen,Fangzhou Zhao,Leiqiang Zong,Yu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROD introduces an RGB-only method for off-road freespace detection, avoiding LiDAR's computational cost and achieving 50 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-road freespace detection is harder due to blurred boundaries, and existing multi-modal methods are too slow for real-time use.

Method: Uses a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for RGB feature extraction and a lightweight decoder for efficiency.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets with 50 FPS.

Conclusion: ROD offers a faster, LiDAR-free solution for real-time off-road freespace detection.

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

### [92] [Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Banding Artifacts on Compressed Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08700)
*Qi Zheng,Li-Heng Chen,Chenlong He,Neil Berkbeck,Yilin Wang,Balu Adsumilli,Alan C. Bovik,Yibo Fan,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses banding artifacts in compressed videos, introduces a new dataset (LIVE-YT-Banding), and proposes CBAND, a no-reference video quality evaluator that outperforms existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Banding artifacts degrade video quality, especially in high-definition videos, but existing datasets lack temporal dynamics. A systematic study and new tools are needed.

Method: Created the LIVE-YT-Banding dataset with 160 AV1-compressed videos and 7,200 subjective opinions. Developed CBAND, a no-reference evaluator using deep neural network embeddings.

Result: CBAND outperforms state-of-the-art models in banding prediction and is faster. It can also optimize debanding models as a differentiable loss function.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable dataset and an efficient tool (CBAND) for assessing and improving video quality by addressing banding artifacts.

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

*Ouyang Xu,Baoming Zhang,Ruiyu Mao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model repair module using a conditional text-to-image model and LVLM to generate and filter synthetic images for rare-case augmentation, improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for visual recognition often fail on underrepresented subpopulations, and existing repair methods are prone to distribution shift and semantic errors.

Method: The approach combines a conditional text-to-image model for targeted image generation and a large vision-language model (LVLM) for filtering, ensuring semantic consistency and alignment with the original data distribution.

Result: Retraining models with the augmented synthetic dataset significantly reduces errors on rare cases without introducing new bugs.

Conclusion: The proposed targeted repair strategy enhances model robustness effectively.

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

### [94] [Adaptive Confidence-Wise Loss for Improved Lens Structure Segmentation in AS-OCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08705)
*Zunjie Xiao,Xiao Wu,Tianhang Liu,Lingxi Hu,Yinling Zhang,Xiaoqing Zhang,Risa Higashita,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss for lens structure segmentation, addressing inhomogeneous sub-regions and boundary errors by leveraging expert annotation confidence. It also proposes a new metric, BECE, for boundary calibration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep segmentation networks equally weight all pixels, ignoring inhomogeneous sub-regions and poor boundary calibration. Expert annotations vary in confidence, inspiring the ACW loss.

Method: ACW groups sub-regions by confidence, applies region-weighted loss, and dynamically optimizes confidence thresholds. BECE metric quantifies boundary miscalibration.

Result: ACW outperforms CE loss with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction in lens segmentation under U-Net.

Conclusion: ACW effectively leverages expert confidence prior, improving segmentation accuracy and calibration, especially in boundary regions.

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

*Andrea Montibeller,Dasara Shullani,Daniele Baracchi,Alessandro Piva,Giulia Boato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework is proposed to emulate social network video compression for improving deepfake detector generalization to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos on social networks challenge deepfake detection due to proprietary compression, which lab-trained detectors fail to handle.

Method: The framework estimates compression and resizing parameters from uploaded videos to emulate platform-specific artifacts without API access.

Result: Emulated data matches real upload degradation; detectors trained on it perform comparably to those using actual shared media.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the lab-to-real gap for deepfake detectors, especially for compressed video content.

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROOMELSA is a benchmark for evaluating 3D retrieval systems in complex, real-world scenarios using natural language queries and panoramic room images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D retrieval systems are limited to simple scenarios, while real-world applications require handling cluttered scenes and vague descriptions.

Method: ROOMELSA focuses on region-specific retrieval within panoramic images, using a large dataset of apartment scenes, rooms, and targeted queries.

Result: Coarse retrieval is largely solved, but only one top model consistently ranked correct matches first. A lightweight CLIP-based model performed well but struggled with subtle variations.

Conclusion: ROOMELSA bridges scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, emphasizing the need for integrated visual and language understanding in robust systems.

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

*Tianyu Xiong,Dayi Tan,Wei Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPose-Animal is a diffusion-based framework for animal pose estimation, using LLMs for semantic guidance and a diffusion decoder for robust predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal pose estimation is challenging due to morphological diversity, complex structures, and limited data.

Method: Reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process, using LLMs for anatomical priors and cross-attention for feature fusion.

Result: Effective on diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal demonstrates strong generalization and robustness in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPO-AdaSharp is a region-adaptive video sharpening model that optimizes bit allocation for perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sharpening ignores texture variations and increases bitrate without optimal allocation.

Method: Uses CTU partition masks to guide bit allocation in an end-to-end model.

Result: Effective in benchmarks for both quality and bitrate savings.

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp improves video sharpening by adapting to regions and optimizing bitrate.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: MonoPartNeRF improves monocular dynamic human rendering by combining rigid and non-rigid transformations, part-based pose embedding, and dynamic texture modeling, outperforming existing methods in complex poses and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based methods struggle with complex pose variations, unnatural transitions at part boundaries, and inaccurate occlusion recovery in monocular settings.

Method: Proposes MonoPartNeRF with bidirectional deformation, part-based pose embedding, keyframe pose retrieval, and dynamic texture modeling via attention.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets, achieving better joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF effectively addresses challenges in dynamic human rendering, offering smoother transitions and robust occlusion recovery.

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

*Luis S. Luevano,Pavel Korshunov,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method for face aging/de-aging using StyleGAN2's latent space with identity preservation, avoiding complex conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on complex conditioning, leading to training challenges and inconsistent identity preservation.

Method: Uses StyleGAN2's latent space with SVM for aging direction and feature selection to ensure identity preservation.

Result: Generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages with preserved identity, useful for benchmarking.

Conclusion: A simple, practical approach for age synthesis with identity guarantees, offering a dataset for future research.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-branch offset learning paradigm (OffSeg) to address misalignment in semantic segmentation for efficient architectures, improving performance with minimal added parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight semantic segmentation methods suffer from misalignment between class representations and image features due to per-pixel classification, limiting efficiency.

Method: A coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm dynamically refines class representations and spatial features, integrated into an efficient network (OffSeg).

Result: Experiments on ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context show consistent improvements (e.g., 2.7% mIoU boost on ADE20K) with negligible parameter overhead.

Conclusion: The offset learning paradigm effectively enhances semantic segmentation efficiency and can be adapted to existing methods without architectural changes.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token-Aware LoRA (TARA) to address issues in multi-concept text-to-image generation, such as identity missing and feature leakage, by using token masks and spatial alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA-based methods for multi-concept generation suffer from interference and misalignment, leading to poor results.

Method: Proposes TARA, which uses token masks to avoid interference and a training objective for spatial alignment.

Result: TARA enables efficient multi-concept inference while preserving visual identities without mutual interference.

Conclusion: TARA effectively solves the issues of interference and misalignment in multi-concept generation, improving results.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack strong spatial reasoning capabilities, limiting their ability to generate 3D representations.

Method: The framework uses an agentic pipeline (designer, coder, visual inspector) to create 3D prototypes with geometry and part labels, requiring no additional training or user input.

Result: Rendered images improve image classification pretraining by 15%, and fine-tuning CLIP with prototypes enhances part segmentation accuracy by 55%.

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM advances MLLMs' spatial reasoning and demonstrates practical applications in improving vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel NR-IQA framework using Anisotropic Texture Richness (ATR) achieves high accuracy in classifying and quantifying image distortions like blur and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, no-reference method for assessing image quality by analyzing directional curvature and texture suppression.

Method: Uses ATR with tunable thresholds for texture suppression, followed by a two-stage system for artifact classification and quality regression.

Result: Achieves 97% accuracy in artifact classification and high predictive accuracy (R2=0.892, RMSE=5.17 DMOS) for quality assessment.

Conclusion: The framework is a dual-purpose tool for effective classification and quantification of image degradation.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end learning framework (FFPN) adaptively preprocesses high-frequency video components to balance quality and bitrate, improving subjective quality and reducing bandwidth/storage costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency components enhance video clarity but increase bitrate, leading to higher costs. The paper aims to optimize this tradeoff.

Method: Uses the Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict optimal preprocessing strategies, trained with pseudo-labeled videos based on RD performance.

Result: The framework improves subjective quality and saves bitrate, validated on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances video quality and bitrate, offering practical benefits for video coding.

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Result: Achieves superior, real-time rendering and visualizes changes over time on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate effectively updates scenes while preserving past information, addressing key challenges in dynamic view synthesis.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,

methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight depth estimation method for light field imaging combines disparity information with a random walk algorithm, offering efficiency and robustness without heavy training or data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational costs and noise sensitivity of existing deep learning-based depth estimation methods in light field imaging.

Method: Integrates light field-based disparity with a directed random walk refinement algorithm, avoiding extensive training or large datasets.

Result: Maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy, though slightly less effective in uncontrolled conditions.

Conclusion: Proposes a robust, efficient alternative to deep learning for depth estimation, with potential for practical applications and future integration of probabilistic models.

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

TL;DR: MaskClu is an unsupervised pre-training method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) on 3D point clouds, combining masked point modeling and clustering-based learning to enhance semantic feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ViTs struggle to learn dense and informative semantic features from 3D point clouds, prompting the need for improved pre-training methods.

Method: MaskClu integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning, reconstructing cluster assignments and centers, and uses global contrastive learning for instance-level feature enhancement.

Result: MaskClu achieves competitive results in 3D tasks like part segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification.

Conclusion: MaskClu effectively learns richer and more semantically meaningful representations from 3D point clouds, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

TL;DR: The study introduces a pipeline for standardized postoperative reporting in CNS tumors using Attention U-Net and DenseNet architectures, achieving high accuracy in segmentation and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited focus on postoperative imaging analysis in CNS tumors and improve clinical decision-making.

Method: Utilized Attention U-Net for segmentation and DenseNet for classification, trained on multicentric datasets with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Segmentation models achieved Dice scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77%; classification models reached 99.5% and 80% accuracy.

Conclusion: The pipeline enhances postoperative evaluation and is integrated into Raidionics for clinical use.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

*Jintao Cheng,Jiehao Luo,Xieyuanli Chen,Jin Wu,Rui Fan,Xiaoyu Tang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view network for LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) improves performance by addressing Euclidean distance limitations through a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism and a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality Learning Metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LPR methods rely on Euclidean distance, ignoring intrinsic feature space structures and intra-class variances, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments.

Method: Proposes a cross-view network with pseudo-global information guidance and a Mahalanobis distance metric using a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance, especially in complex environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures nonlinear data distributions and improves LPR accuracy.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

*Miruna-Alexandra Gafencu,Reem Shaban,Yordanka Velikova,Mohammad Farid Azampour,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel robotic system integrates real-time shape completion with ultrasound imaging to improve spinal visualization, addressing shadowing artifacts and registration limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging for spinal procedures is limited by shadowing artifacts and the complexity of CT-to-US registration. Shape completion methods offer potential but lack real-time capabilities and reproducibility.

Method: The system combines robotic ultrasound with deep learning-based shape completion to autonomously acquire US sweeps, extract vertebral surfaces, and reconstruct anatomy in real-time.

Result: Quantitative experiments show accurate shape completion, and qualitative results demonstrate effective visualization on a phantom and volunteer scan.

Conclusion: The integrated system enhances consistency, reproducibility, and anatomical understanding in spinal ultrasound procedures.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Motivation: Volumetric data compression is essential in fields like medical imaging and entertainment, but traditional methods often involve redundant computation and hierarchical metadata.

Method: Combines Fourier-feature encoding with selective voxel sampling, using morphological dilation to prioritize active regions and reduce redundant computation.

Result: Training time reduced by 63.7% (30 to 11 minutes), PSNR dropped 0.59 dB, SSIM by 0.008, achieving a compression rate of 14.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, structure-free solution for efficient volumetric compression, connecting coordinate-based neural representation with practical applications.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

*Eduarda Caldeira,Fadi Boutros,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot approach for Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) using CLIP without fine-tuning, improving performance through prompt aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of MAD in face recognition security by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities without task-specific training.

Method: Uses CLIP with multiple textual prompts per class, aggregating their embeddings to align with MAD task requirements.

Result: Prompt aggregation significantly enhances zero-shot MAD detection performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of foundation models like CLIP for generalizable MAD solutions through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight transformer framework for skeleton-based action recognition integrates spatial and temporal modeling in one module, reducing redundancy and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for skeleton-based action recognition are complex, computationally heavy, and lack scalability due to separate temporal modeling blocks.

Method: Proposes a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer with a single attention module and a multi-scale pooling fusion module for local and global motion capture.

Result: The model reduces parameters by 58% and computational costs by 60% while maintaining competitive accuracy on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for skeleton-based action recognition without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layout-Togglable Storytelling, a method using layout conditions to enhance subject consistency and control in storytelling tasks, supported by a new dataset (Lay2Story-1M) and benchmark (Lay2Story-Bench). The proposed framework, Lay2Story, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with subject consistency and precise control in storytelling tasks due to lack of fine-grained guidance and high-quality data.

Method: Proposes Layout-Togglable Storytelling, leveraging layout conditions for inter-frame interaction, and introduces Lay2Story-1M dataset and Lay2Story-Bench benchmark. Uses Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for the Lay2Story framework.

Result: Lay2Story achieves superior performance in consistency, semantic correlation, and aesthetic quality compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Layout conditions effectively improve storytelling tasks, and the proposed framework and datasets advance the field significantly.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset (BrightVQA) and a Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM) to address domain shift in Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA), achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional change detection methods require expert knowledge, and existing CDVQA methods assume similar training-testing distributions, which is unrealistic due to domain shifts.

Method: Proposes TCSSM, a model leveraging bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related text to extract domain-invariant features, with input-dependent parameters dynamically predicted.

Result: TCSSM outperforms state-of-the-art models in experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling domain shifts.

Conclusion: The work advances CDVQA by addressing domain shift, with the dataset and model publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache is a training-free caching strategy for video diffusion models that improves visual quality by focusing on late denoising stages, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cache-based methods cause structural discrepancies and hinder instruction following and character consistency in video diffusion models.

Method: TaoCache uses a fixed-point perspective to predict noise output, calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios for aggressive skipping while preserving structure.

Result: TaoCache achieves higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior methods under the same speedups.

Conclusion: TaoCache is effective for late denoising stages, integrates well with other accelerations, and enhances visual quality in video diffusion models.

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores using pretrained LLMs for color recommendation in design, proposing ColorGPT, a pipeline that outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colors are vital in design, but traditional methods struggle with complexity and data limitations. The study investigates if LLMs can improve color recommendation.

Method: Developed ColorGPT, testing color representations and prompt engineering, focusing on palette completion and full palette generation from textual descriptions.

Result: ColorGPT outperformed existing methods in accuracy and color distribution for palette completion and improved diversity and similarity in full palette generation.

Conclusion: Pretrained LLMs, like ColorGPT, can effectively serve as superior designers for color recommendation tasks.

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

Motivation: Current video LLMs use uniform compression, risking loss of keyframes with essential details. KFFocus addresses this by focusing on uneven temporal distribution of critical information.

Method: KFFocus replaces uniform sampling with a refined approach to identify keyframes and assigns varying condensation ratios. It includes a spatiotemporal modeling module for nuanced understanding.

Result: KFFocus outperforms existing methods in benchmarks, especially for long videos, achieving better efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: KFFocus effectively balances compression and information retention, enhancing video LLM performance.

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

### [121] [Spatial-Temporal Multi-Scale Quantization for Flexible Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08991)
*Zan Wang,Jingze Zhang,Yixin Chen,Baoxiong Jia,Wei Liang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSQ introduces a multi-scale quantization method for human motion generation, addressing limitations in current representations by enabling compositional flexibility and multi-scale modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion representations lack multi-scale perspective and compositional flexibility, limiting complex pattern modeling and generalization in diverse tasks.

Method: MSQ compresses motion sequences into multi-scale discrete tokens using distinct encoders for spatial granularities and temporal interpolation, followed by quantization. A generative mask modeling model supports motion editing, control, and conditional generation.

Result: MSQ outperforms baselines, enabling seamless token composition without specialized design or re-training.

Conclusion: MSQ provides a scalable and flexible solution for motion generation, enhancing performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

*Yuhao Wang,Wei Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UniConvNet, a universal ConvNet model that expands the effective receptive field (ERF) while maintaining its asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) by combining smaller kernels. It outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large ERF in ConvNets is promising but constrained by high computational costs and disrupted AGD. The goal is to achieve efficiency and effectiveness by maintaining AGD while expanding ERF.

Method: Introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator and a Layer Operator to expand ERF while preserving AGD. Uses smaller kernels (e.g., 7x7, 9x9, 11x11) in combination.

Result: UniConvNet outperforms CNNs and ViTs on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017, and ADE20K. UniConvNet-T achieves 84.2% top-1 accuracy with 30M parameters, while UniConvNet-XL reaches 88.4%.

Conclusion: UniConvNet is a scalable and efficient alternative to large-kernel ConvNets, maintaining AGD and achieving high performance across tasks and model sizes.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/ai-paperwithcode/UniConvNet.

### [123] [Towards Perfection: Building Inter-component Mutual Correction for Retinex-based Low-light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09009)
*Luyang Cao,Han Xu,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Jiayi Ma,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of inter-component residuals (ICR) in Retinex-based low-light image enhancement and proposes a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to mitigate ICR's impact, improving decomposition and enhancement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Retinex-based methods underestimate the impact of inter-component residuals (ICR), which degrade decomposition accuracy and final image quality.

Method: Proposes IRetinex with an inter-component residual reduction module for decomposition and uses feature similarity to detect and mitigate ICR during enhancement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Addressing ICR significantly improves low-light image enhancement, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed IRetinex model.

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

*Kaiwen Huang,Tao Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yizhe Zhang,Yi Zhou,Xiao-Jun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UC-Seg is a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that addresses cognitive biases and pseudo-label generation challenges by using cross-subnet consistency and uncertainty-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on expert annotations and mitigate cognitive biases in semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes UC-Seg with Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) and Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) to enhance feature representation and generate high-confidence pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves superior segmentation accuracy and generalization across MRI, CT, ultrasound, and colonoscopy images.

Conclusion: UC-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

*Zhiqiang Yang,Renshuai Tao,Xiaolong Zheng,Guodong Yang,Chunjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPGNet addresses deepfake detection challenges by leveraging unlabeled data and bridging domain gaps, outperforming SoTA by 6.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotators struggle with labeling deepfakes due to their realism, making labeled data unreliable and scarce.

Method: DPGNet uses text-guided cross-domain alignment and curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, with cross-domain knowledge distillation.

Result: DPGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.3% on 11 datasets.

Conclusion: DPGNet effectively utilizes unlabeled data to tackle deepfake detection challenges caused by realistic AI-generated content.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision-Language-Action model integrating spatial and temporal understanding via visual prompting, improving task-solving performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance agent movement prediction by combining spatial and temporal aspects, addressing limitations of prior independent approaches.

Method: Projects visual traces of key points onto depth maps to simultaneously capture spatial and temporal information.

Result: Experiments in SimplerEnv show a 4% improvement over SpatialVLA and 19% over TraceVLA in task-solving.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates spatial-temporal understanding and is practical for data-scarce real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalization step to enhance existing text-to-image methods, using prompt-specific and noise-seed-specific techniques with self- and cross-attention losses. It leverages PDM features for improved semantic similarity and shows significant improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance visual concept learning (text-to-image personalization) by improving the identity capture of personalized concepts, applicable in areas like product placement and personalized design.

Method: Augments existing methods with a personalization step using prompt- and noise-seed-specific techniques, incorporating self- and cross-attention losses. Utilizes PDM features for better semantic similarity.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements over six personalization methods and various base text-to-image models, including UNet- and DiT-based ones.

Conclusion: The proposed personalization step effectively enhances existing text-to-image methods, outperforming previous per-query personalization techniques.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

*Shanle Yao,Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre,Armin Danesh Pazho,Hamed Tabkhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An active learning framework for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) improves adaptability in dynamic real-world settings by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback and adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAD struggles in dynamic environments due to changing definitions of 'normal' and inadequate traditional metrics.

Method: Uses active learning to select informative data for labeling, incorporates human feedback, and defines adaptive thresholds.

Result: Achieves an EBI of 68.91 in simulated real-world scenarios, showing practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework enhances VAD's applicability in dynamic environments by improving adaptability and accuracy.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: VLM-3D is an end-to-end framework using VLMs for 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving, improving accuracy by 12.8% with a joint semantic-geometric loss design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of open-set perception in traffic environments by leveraging VLMs' semantic reasoning capabilities to improve safety.

Method: Proposes VLM-3D, incorporating LoRA for efficient adaptation and a joint semantic-geometric loss (token-level semantic loss early, 3D IoU loss later).

Result: 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: VLM-3D effectively enhances 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving, validated by significant accuracy gains.

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling up learned image compression models, revealing performance trends through scaling laws, and demonstrates improved rate-distortion performance with larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned image compression models are limited in scale, and the impact of scaling on performance is unexplored.

Method: Scales the HPCM model from 68.5M to 1B parameters, fitting power-law relations between test loss and scaling variables (model size, training compute).

Result: The scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, revealing a scaling trend.

Conclusion: This work encourages future exploration of large-scale compression models and deeper study of the compression-intelligence connection.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an attribute-agnostic debiasing method for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in glaucoma screening, using unsupervised clustering and weighted contrastive learning to reduce demographic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs exhibit demographic biases even without explicit protected attributes during training, which is problematic for critical applications like glaucoma screening, where underserved populations are disproportionately affected.

Method: The method involves (i) inferring proxy subgroups via unsupervised clustering, (ii) computing gradient-similarity weights between multimodal and image-pair contrastive losses, and (iii) applying these weights in a joint objective to upweight underperforming clusters.

Result: The method is evaluated on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma subset, showing improved equitable performance across inferred subgroups using metrics like Equalized Odds Distance (EOD) and Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES AUC).

Conclusion: The proposed label-free debiasing approach effectively reduces subgroup disparities in VLMs for glaucoma screening, targeting underperforming clusters adaptively.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based solution to enhance liveness detection in facial recognition systems, addressing gaps in current anti-spoofing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of biometric authentication systems is threatened by advanced spoofing attacks, which current liveness detection methods fail to counter effectively.

Method: The study introduces novel deep learning models integrating texture analysis and reflective properties to distinguish genuine traits from replicas.

Result: Evaluations on diverse datasets show the best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieves 99.9% accuracy, outperforming existing systems.

Conclusion: The models not only improve authentication security but also provide insights into evolving spoofing tactics, boosting confidence in biometric systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

TL;DR: Proposes Turbo-VAED, a mobile-optimized VAE decoder, reducing parameters and latency while retaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks of video VAEs on mobile devices due to large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels.

Method: Analyzes VAE redundancy, integrates 3D depthwise separable convolutions, proposes decoupled 3D pixel shuffle, and distills decoder for fast adaptation.

Result: Achieves 84.5x speedup, 17.5% parameter count, 96.9% quality retention, and real-time 720p decoding on mobile.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED enables efficient mobile deployment of video VAEs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets for full-body human captures has hindered progress in relighting and novel-view rendering.

Method: The authors introduce the HumanOLAT dataset, featuring multi-view One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures, including HDR RGB frames under diverse illuminations.

Conclusion: HumanOLAT is expected to advance research by enabling rigorous benchmarking and improvements in relighting and rendering techniques.

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human

lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

### [135] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bilevel MCTS modification and Tree Collapsing to improve node selection efficiency in classical planning, achieving amortized O(1) runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS in classical planning suffers from high node selection time due to large search depths, unlike game tree search where it's negligible.

Method: Introduces a bilevel MCTS with best-first search from leaf nodes and Tree Collapsing to reduce action selection steps.

Result: Achieves amortized O(1) runtime for node selection, matching traditional queue-based OPEN lists.

Conclusion: The enhancements significantly improve MCTS efficiency in classical planning.

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

### [136] [Designing Memory-Augmented AR Agents for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Personalized Task Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08774)
*Dongwook Choi,Taeyoon Kwon,Dongil Yang,Hyojun Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a memory-augmented AR agent framework to enhance personalized task assistance by leveraging historical user interactions, addressing limitations in current AR systems for complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR agents lack the ability to handle multi-step tasks requiring long-term user experience and preference understanding, prompting the need for a memory-augmented solution.

Method: The framework includes four modules: Perception (sensor processing), Memory (experience storage), Spatiotemporal Reasoning (context synthesis), and Actuator (AR communication).

Result: A conceptual framework and implementation roadmap are presented, with potential applications demonstrating its adaptability across domains.

Conclusion: The work aims to inspire future research for more intelligent AR systems that integrate user history with adaptive, context-aware assistance.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

### [137] [A Dual-Axis Taxonomy of Knowledge Editing for LLMs: From Mechanisms to Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08795)
*Amir Mohammad Salehoof,Ali Ramezani,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh,Majid Nili Ahmadabadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys knowledge editing in large language models (LLMs), proposing a function-based taxonomy alongside existing mechanism-based approaches to provide a comprehensive view. It evaluates editing effectiveness across knowledge types and outlines challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of retraining LLMs for updating knowledge, the paper explores knowledge editing as an alternative, emphasizing the overlooked function of knowledge in existing surveys.

Method: Introduces a function-based taxonomy to complement mechanism-based approaches, analyzing editing effectiveness for factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and social knowledge.

Result: Maps the current landscape of knowledge editing, highlights strengths and limitations of methods, and provides formal definitions, evaluation tasks, and datasets.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions for knowledge editing in LLMs, advocating for a holistic approach combining function and mechanism perspectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

*Yi Tang,Kaini Wang,Yang Chen,Guangquan Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EndoAgent is a memory-guided AI agent for endoscopic analysis, integrating iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, outperforming existing models in clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI methods lack unified coordination for multi-step clinical workflows, and AI agents' potential in endoscopy is underexplored.

Method: EndoAgent uses a dual-memory design for logical coherence (short-term) and experiential learning (long-term), integrating expert tools in a reasoning loop.

Result: EndoAgent outperforms general and medical multimodal models, demonstrating flexibility and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: EndoAgent advances endoscopic AI by combining memory-guided reasoning with tool integration, validated by extensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

*Chen Li,Han Zhang,Zhantao Yang,Fangyi Chen,Zihan Wang,Anudeepsekhar Bolimera,Marios Savvides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELAR-Vision improves vision-language models by introducing topology-aware reasoning, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional chain-of-thought methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex multimodal tasks and verbose outputs due to reliance on chain-of-thought reasoning, which may not suit all tasks.

Method: Introduces TopoAug for synthetic data with diverse topological structures, uses supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and proposes Frugal Learning to reduce output length.

Result: Improves accuracy by 9.7% over the base model and outperforms larger models on benchmarks, with strong generalization on OOD tasks.

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision demonstrates superior performance and generalization, offering a promising direction for topology-aware reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

### [140] [Silicon Minds versus Human Hearts: The Wisdom of Crowds Beats the Wisdom of AI in Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08830)
*Mustafa Akben,Vinayaka Gude,Haya Ajjan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs outperform humans in individual emotion recognition but are surpassed by collective human intelligence. Human-AI collaboration yields the highest accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's emotional intelligence, particularly MLLMs, and compare their emotion recognition abilities with humans.

Method: Evaluated MLLMs and humans using RMET and MRMET, comparing individual and collective performance, and testing human-AI collaboration.

Result: MLLMs outperformed humans individually, but human groups surpassed MLLMs collectively. Human-AI collaboration achieved the highest accuracy.

Conclusion: Collective human intelligence and human-AI collaboration are key for effective emotional AI, despite MLLMs' strong individual performance.

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

TL;DR: OpenCUA is an open-source framework for vision-language models (CUAs) to study capabilities, limitations, and risks. It includes annotation tools, a large-scale dataset (AgentNet), and a scalable pipeline, achieving SOTA performance (34.8% success rate).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open frameworks for studying CUAs, which are increasingly used for consequential digital interactions.

Method: Proposes OpenCUA with (1) annotation infrastructure, (2) AgentNet dataset, and (3) a scalable pipeline for state-action pairs with Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: OpenCUA-32B achieves 34.8% success rate on OSWorld-Verified, surpassing GPT-4o.

Conclusion: OpenCUA provides open tools and models for advancing CUA research, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces APCIR, an adaptive personalization method for conversational information retrieval, dynamically adjusting personalization levels and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR systems often use a uniform personalization approach, which may not suit all queries, leading to sub-optimal results.

Method: APCIR identifies the required personalization level for each query, integrates personalized queries with other reformulations, and uses a dynamic ranking fusion approach.

Result: APCIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TREC iKAT datasets, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Adaptive personalization in CIR systems improves performance by tailoring personalization to query needs.

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Ryan Mioduski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs effectively convert historical land patent descriptions into accurate coordinates, outperforming traditional methods and offering cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitation of spatial analysis due to narrative land patent descriptions by leveraging LLMs for accurate georeferencing.

Method: Six OpenAI models were tested under two paradigms (direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought) on a digitized corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts.

Result: The top model achieved a mean error of 23 km, outperforming baselines by up to 70%. A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical AI models lack deep medical understanding and struggle with text-image relationships, prompting the need for a specialized solution.

Method: Doctor Sun combines a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical LLM, using two-stage training (feature alignment and instruction tuning) on diverse medical datasets.

Result: The model is released alongside SunMed-VL, a bilingual medical multimodal dataset, to support further research.

Conclusion: Doctor Sun advances biomedical multimodal research by improving the integration and interpretation of medical data.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MiGrATe introduces online test-time training (TTT) for LLMs using GRPO and mixed-policy group construction to balance exploration and exploitation in black-box optimization tasks, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of in-context learning and hand-crafted training data in black-box optimization tasks with LLMs.

Method: MiGrATe uses GRPO for online TTT, combining on-policy sampling with greedy and neighborhood sampling to adapt LLMs at inference without external data.

Result: MiGrATe outperforms inference-only and TTT baselines in word search, molecule optimization, and ARC tasks.

Conclusion: Online TTT with MiGrATe is effective for complex search tasks without external supervision, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces M²LLM, a multi-view framework combining molecular structure, task, and rules views to enhance molecular property prediction using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular representation methods like fingerprints and GNNs lack semantic and contextual knowledge, which LLMs can provide.

Method: M²LLM integrates three perspectives (structure, task, rules) dynamically and leverages LLMs for molecular embeddings and feature curation.

Result: M²LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly improve molecular property prediction by combining structural, task-specific, and rule-based reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

TL;DR: MoSSDA is a novel two-step SSDA framework for time-series classification, using a domain-invariant encoder and mixup-enhanced contrastive learning to achieve robust performance under domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in deep learning models due to domain shift in time-series data by leveraging semi-supervised domain adaptation.

Method: Proposes MoSSDA: a two-step framework with a domain-invariant encoder and a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module, trained without data augmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six datasets, validated across different backbones and unlabeled data ratios.

Conclusion: MoSSDA effectively handles domain shift in time-series data, with each module contributing to improved performance.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver cancer's high lethality necessitates early detection, requiring accurate and automated tumor segmentation in medical images.

Method: Integration of 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for hyperparameter optimization (e.g., learning rate, batch size) to enhance segmentation.

Result: High F1-score at lower prediction thresholds, balancing precision and recall, suitable for clinical diagnostics.

Conclusion: The synergy of deep learning and metaheuristic optimization offers an effective solution for complex medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high

*Shibin Su,Guoqiang Liang,De Cheng,Shizhou Zhang,Lingyan Ran,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach using a Global Workspace Model (GWM) and multi-level collaborative distillation improves stability and adaptability in Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) under strict memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCIL faces challenges in maintaining model stability and adaptability under strict memory constraints, where current methods (replay-based or ensemble) fall short.

Method: Proposes a GWM to fuse student model parameters, capturing historical learning, and a multi-level distillation mechanism for peer-to-peer consistency and knowledge alignment.

Result: Significant performance improvement on three OCIL benchmarks across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: The method balances stability and plasticity, enhancing OCIL model performance under memory constraints.

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

*Chaoqun Cui,Liangbin Huang,Shijing Wang,Zhe Tong,Zhaolong Huang,Xiao Zeng,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSPO, a method for aligning speech durations in video dubbing to solve audio-video sync issues caused by language differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Duration mismatches in video dubbing disrupt synchronization, harming viewer experience.

Method: Proposes SSPO, using segment-wise sampling and fine-grained loss for duration alignment.

Result: SSPO outperforms in duration alignment tasks.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively addresses duration mismatches in video dubbing.

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from
the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine
translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information
densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech
duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact
viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based
video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We
propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which
employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate
duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results
demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment
tasks.

*Kuan-Tang Huang,Li-Wei Chen,Hung-Shin Lee,Berlin Chen,Hsin-Min Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A normalization technique is proposed to improve ASR performance by aligning feature representations with a clean reference channel, addressing degradation from channel variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR models degrade with different recording channels, often attributed to corpus mismatch. This study argues channel variations fundamentally harm performance.

Method: Proposes a normalization technique to align internal ASR model features with those from a clean reference channel.

Result: Significantly improves ASR performance on unseen channels and languages, showing generalization across variations.

Conclusion: The technique effectively mitigates channel variation impact, enhancing ASR robustness across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

TL;DR: An AI-driven pipeline optimizes LLM adapter allocation in single-node setups, improving performance and resource efficiency, with insights extendable to multi-replica deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation and challenges in optimal placement when serving diverse LLM adapters.

Method: Develops an analytical, AI-driven pipeline and a Digital Twin to replicate and predict optimal adapter allocation.

Result: Digital Twin achieves ≤5.5% SMAPE difference in throughput; pipeline predicts optimal placement with minimal latency.

Conclusion: The approach enhances performance and resource efficiency in LLM adapter serving, scalable to multi-replica setups.

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective
approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use
cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and
substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in
optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical,
AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of
adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance,
effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation.
Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns.
These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica
deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration,
ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our
approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for
overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the
first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems
with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in
throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately
predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite uses LLMs for SQL query rewriting, addressing rule-based limitations by integrating execution awareness and semantic grounding. It achieves significant efficiency gains and broader query coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based SQL rewriting methods generalize poorly and struggle with complex queries. LLMs offer potential but lack execution awareness, leading to suboptimal rewrites.

Method: E3-Rewrite combines a context construction module (using execution plans and demonstrations) and a reinforcement learning framework with a staged curriculum for multi-objective learning.

Result: Achieves up to 25.6% reduction in query execution time and 24.4% more successful rewrites compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite effectively leverages LLMs for SQL rewriting, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and coverage.

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

*Mutian Tong,Rundi Wu,Changxi Zheng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for estimating spatiotemporally varying indoor lighting from a single image or video using 2D diffusion priors and MLP representation, showing superior performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor lighting estimation is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, especially with spatial and temporal variations. Existing methods struggle with in-the-wild scenes.

Method: Uses a pre-trained image diffusion model fine-tuned to predict lighting by inpainting multiple chrome balls as light probes, optimizing a light field represented as an MLP.

Result: Superior performance in indoor lighting estimation from single images or videos, with demonstrated spatiotemporally consistent results on in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively estimates varying indoor lighting, generalizes to in-the-wild scenes, and outperforms baselines, addressing a gap in previous works.

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

*Dalton Omens,Allise Thurman,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for retargeting facial performances between humans or virtual characters using volumetric morphing and Simon-Says expressions for calibration, with a fine-tuning approach to improve semantic control output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in retargeting facial performances across different subjects or virtual characters while maintaining semantic accuracy and avoiding undesirable controls.

Method: Utilizes volumetric morphing and Simon-Says expressions for rig calibration, followed by a fine-tuning approach using implicit differentiation to improve control semantics.

Result: The method achieves acceptable geometry reconstructions but requires fine-tuning to ensure semantically meaningful animation controls.

Conclusion: The fine-tuning approach enhances retargeting efficacy by addressing undesirable controls, making it suitable for real-world applications like games and VR.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: HybridPF combines short-range and long-range filtering trajectories for point cloud denoising, using parallel modules (ShortModule and LongModule) guided by a joint loss function, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud filtering methods often fail to address noise retention or clustering issues, necessitating a hybrid approach for better denoising.

Method: Proposes HybridPF with two parallel modules (ShortModule and LongModule) for short-range scores and long-range flows, trained jointly with a dynamic graph convolutional decoder.

Result: HybridPF outperforms existing methods in denoising accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines short and long-range information, improving point cloud denoising performance.

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

*Qianru Qiu,Jiafeng Mao,Xueting Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve color scheme control in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation by integrating color palettes as a separate guidance mechanism alongside prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models lack comprehensive control over color schemes, especially for background and less prominent objects.

Method: Proposes integrating color palettes as guidance in a diffusion-based framework, exploring palette representations and constructing specialized datasets.

Result: Palette guidance significantly enhances the model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes.

Conclusion: The approach enables more controlled and refined colorization in T2I generation.

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual cameras lack control over settings and optical artifacts, hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam aims to address these gaps.

Method: DiffPhysCam uses a multi-stage pipeline for fine-grained camera control, modeling optical effects, and calibration with real-world data. It supports forward and inverse rendering.

Result: The simulator improves robotic perception in synthetic tasks and enables digital twin creation for autonomous vehicle navigation.

Conclusion: DiffPhysCam enhances sim-to-real transfer and supports robotics applications through advanced differentiable rendering.

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Motivation: Existing autoregressive methods produce incomplete intermediate structures, limiting flexibility.

Method: VertexRegen reverses edge collapse (vertex split) via a generative model, inspired by progressive meshes.

Result: Produces meshes comparable to state-of-the-art, with anytime generation and variable detail.

Conclusion: VertexRegen uniquely enables flexible, valid meshes at any generation step.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of
detail.

TL;DR: ColorCtrl is a training-free method for precise text-guided color editing in images/videos, leveraging MM-DiT attention mechanisms to ensure consistency and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precise color control and introduce visual inconsistencies, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Disentangles structure and color via attention map and value token manipulation in MM-DiT, enabling word-level control.

Result: Outperforms existing training-free methods and commercial models in edit quality, consistency, and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: ColorCtrl is versatile, effective, and superior for text-guided color editing across images, videos, and instruction-based models.

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric chest X-rays in low-resource settings often suffer from noise due to low-dose protocols, compromising diagnostic accuracy.

Method: SharpXR uses a Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder and a learnable fusion module to balance noise suppression and detail retention, trained on simulated noise data.

Result: SharpXR outperforms baselines, improving pneumonia classification accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%.

Conclusion: SharpXR is effective for denoising pediatric X-rays, enhancing diagnostic accuracy in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource

TL;DR: A novel variational volume reconstruction method using the Deep Ritz method addresses challenges in sparse, noisy slice data, avoiding segmentation and reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical imaging applications like MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) face challenges with noisy data, sparse slices, and computational expense.

Method: Combines a regression loss (avoiding segmentation) with a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy for regularization. Uses neural networks, Monte Carlo integration, and ADAM optimization.

Result: Produces high-quality reconstructed volumes quickly, even with sparse and noisy data.

Conclusion: The method effectively overcomes key challenges in volume reconstruction, offering a fast and reliable solution.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse,
noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging
applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our
approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation
to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to
reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the
computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a
variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image
segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified
Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the
reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,
approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo
integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational
objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to
the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces
high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice
data is sparse and noisy.

Conclusion: The algorithm is a complementary, impactful step for hyperspectral unmixing pipelines, with potential for widespread practical use.

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of
hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral
variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by
factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major
challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate
model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that
corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and
compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm
provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively
on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present
a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive
experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's
impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed
preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,
including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with
error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale
correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by
existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight
its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.
The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

### [165] [Frequency-Assisted Adaptive Sharpening Scheme Considering Bitrate and Quality Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08854)
*Yingxue Pang,Shijie Zhao,Haiqiang Wang,Gen Zhan,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FreqSP, a model to predict optimal sharpening levels for videos, balancing quality and bitrate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpening improves video quality but can degrade QoS and cause over-sharpening. A method is needed to optimize sharpening levels for quality and bandwidth.

Method: FreqSP uses CNN features and high-frequency components to predict optimal sharpening levels from uncompressed videos.

Result: Experiments show FreqSP effectively balances video quality and bitrate.

Conclusion: FreqSP provides a solution for optimizing sharpening levels to enhance video quality without excessive bandwidth costs.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can
effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the
sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded
Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily
improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as
over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video
quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs
effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening
level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening
level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.
Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages
intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal
sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

### [166] [A new dataset and comparison for multi-camera frame synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09068)
*Conall Daly,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel multi-camera dataset enables fair comparison between frame interpolation and view synthesis methods, revealing performance differences on real vs. synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets bias comparisons between frame interpolation and view synthesis. A fair evaluation requires a neutral dataset.

Method: Developed a dense linear camera array dataset and compared classical/deep learning frame interpolators with 3D Gaussian Splatting for view in-betweening.

Result: Deep learning methods don't outperform classical ones on real data (3.5 dB PSNR gap), but 3D Gaussian Splatting excels on synthetic scenes (5 dB PSNR advantage).

Conclusion: Dataset choice impacts method performance; synthetic scenes favor view synthesis, while real data favors frame interpolation.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly
categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques.
Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same
task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However,
most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras
moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically
biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct
comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging.
In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built
dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches.
We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view
synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening.
Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform
classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually
underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in
synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms
frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

### [167] [Efficient motion-based metrics for video frame interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09078)
*Conall Daly,Darren Ramsook,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a motion-based quality metric for video frame interpolation (VFI) by analyzing motion field divergence, showing better correlation with perceptual scores and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated frames in VFI is challenging, and existing metrics like PSNR or SSIM may not align well with human perception.

Method: The study processes motion fields to create a quality metric, evaluates it using the BVI-VFI dataset, and compares it to FloLPIPS.

Result: The proposed metric correlates reasonably with perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is computationally faster (x2.7 speedup). It favors perceptually pleasing results over PSNR/SSIM.

Conclusion: The new motion-based metric is effective for evaluating VFI algorithms, aligning better with human perception and offering computational efficiency.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames
between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of
advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in
recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains
an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to
process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric
for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality
metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for
interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based
on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably
with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient
(x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then
use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame
interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual
pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or
SSIM.

*Jiayi Li,Chengxi Yan,Yurong Zeng,Zhichao Fang,Huiru Wang*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Topic-Method Composition (TMC) to analyze the interplay between research topics and methods in Digital Humanities (DH), offering deeper insights than traditional bibliometric studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies in DH lacked depth in understanding technological advancements and topic-method relationships, leading to superficial conclusions.

Method: The study proposes a TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis to examine knowledge structures.

Result: The workflow provides detailed insights into DH's development, revealing intersections between digital technology and humanities.

Conclusion: The TMC approach enhances interpretability of DH research and is adaptable to other fields.

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates
computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative
topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by
the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help
of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across
multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and
institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their
ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological
advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend
to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and
topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a
new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid
knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics
and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between
TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital
technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a
TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network
analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research
disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it
enables a detailed view of the knowledge structures, providing a tool adaptable
to other fields.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes P/D-Device, a method to separate large language models between cloud and devices to improve performance, reduce latency, and increase throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaggregated large language models face bottlenecks in cloud resource occupation and on-device computing capacity, leading to high latency and low throughput.

Method: Separate the model between cloud and devices, with the cloud assisting only in the prefill phase. Devices respond immediately after the first token, and a speed controller smoothes TPOT. On-device prefill is amortized using received tokens.

Result: TTFT decreases by at least 60%, maximum TPOT is tens of milliseconds, and cloud throughput increases by up to 15x.

Conclusion: P/D-Device effectively addresses resource bottlenecks, improving latency and throughput in serving large language models.

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.
