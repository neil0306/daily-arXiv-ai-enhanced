### [1] [Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) Enhances Phishing Webpage Detection in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13357)
*Atharva Bhargude,Ishan Gonehal,Chandler Haney,Dave Yoon,Kevin Zhu,Aaron Sandoval,Sean O'Brien,Kaustubh Vinnakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) for phishing detection using multimodal LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieving high accuracy (F1-score 0.93).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, requiring adaptive detection methods to counter sophisticated attempts.

Method: ALP guides LLMs to analyze phishing content through structured semantic reasoning, focusing on linguistic patterns, urgency cues, and manipulative diction, integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis.

Result: ALP significantly improves phishing detection accuracy, achieving an F1-score of 0.93, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs offer a robust, interpretable, and adaptive solution for phishing detection, setting a foundation for future advancements.

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating
adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic
Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal
capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides
LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns,
detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in
phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we
propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.
Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection
accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis.
The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to
advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93,
surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for
more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection
systems using LLMs.

### [2] [Persona-Based Synthetic Data Generation Using Multi-Stage Conditioning with Large Language Models for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13380)
*Keito Inoshita,Rushia Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaGen is a framework using LLMs to generate diverse emotional text by creating layered virtual personas, outperforming baselines in quality and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scarce, diverse emotional datasets due to subjectivity and ethical/practical constraints in data collection.

Method: Multi-stage persona-based conditioning with LLMs, combining demographics, socio-cultural backgrounds, and situational contexts to guide emotion generation.

Result: PersonaGen produces diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, validated through clustering, quality scoring, and comparison with real-world data.

Conclusion: PersonaGen is a promising alternative for augmenting or replacing real emotional datasets, enhancing emotion recognition models.

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

### [3] [SAFT: Structure-Aware Fine-Tuning of LLMs for AMR-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13381)
*Rafiq Kamel,Filippo Guerranti,Simon Geisler,Stephan GÃ¼nnemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAFT introduces a structure-aware fine-tuning method for LLMs to handle graph-structured inputs like AMRs, achieving a 3.5 BLEU improvement on AMR 3.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for LLMs on structured inputs like AMRs either discard structural cues or use incompatible architectures, limiting performance.

Method: SAFT injects graph topology into LLMs using direction-sensitive positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs, without altering the LLM architecture.

Result: SAFT achieves a 3.5 BLEU improvement on AMR 3.0, with gains scaling with graph complexity.

Conclusion: SAFT provides a general and effective way to integrate structured data with language models, enhancing performance on tasks like AMR-to-text generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

### [4] [Context-Based Fake News Detection using Graph Based Approach: ACOVID-19 Use-case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13382)
*Chandrashekar Muniyappa,Sirisha Velampalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based approach using NLP and MDL-based GBAD to detect fake news, tested on a Kaggle dataset enhanced with COVID-19 news.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rapid spread of fake news in the digital world.

Method: Uses NLP to convert news articles into contextual graphs, then applies MDL-based GBAD for anomaly detection.

Result: Identifies normative and anomalous patterns to detect fake news effectively.

Conclusion: Graph-based methods are effective for detecting fake news by uncovering complex patterns.

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

### [5] [PARAM-1 BharatGen 2.9B Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13390)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARAM-1 is a 2.9B parameter LLM designed for Indian linguistic diversity, trained on Hindi and English with equitable representation, fair tokenization, and culturally aligned benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the under-representation of linguistically diverse regions like India in LLMs, which are dominated by English-centric designs.

Method: Trained on a bilingual Hindi-English dataset with principles like equitable corpus allocation, fair tokenization, and culturally aligned evaluation.

Result: PARAM-1 serves as a competent general-purpose model and a robust baseline for India-centric applications.

Conclusion: PARAM-1 provides a design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling, embedding diversity at the pretraining level.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

### [6] [TopicImpact: Improving Customer Feedback Analysis with Opinion Units for Topic Modeling and Star-Rating Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13392)
*Emil HÃ¤glund,Johanna BjÃ¶rklund*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves topic modeling by using opinion units (text excerpts with sentiment scores) extracted via large language models, enhancing topic coherence and interpretability while linking topics and sentiments to business metrics like star ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance insight extraction from customer reviews by restructuring the topic modeling pipeline to focus on opinion units, improving topic coherence and sentiment integration.

Method: Restructures topic modeling to use opinion units (text excerpts with sentiment scores) extracted by large language models, then correlates topics and sentiments with business metrics.

Result: Improved topic modeling performance with coherent, interpretable topics and sentiment associations, validated through star-rating prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed system outperforms traditional topic modeling by integrating sentiment and topics, providing actionable insights for business outcomes.

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and
classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating
coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment
modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

### [7] [Mitigating Stylistic Biases of Machine Translation Systems via Monolingual Corpora Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13395)
*Xuanqi Gao,Weipeng Jiang,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma,Siyi Xie,Xinyang Yin,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Babel is a novel framework for enhancing stylistic fidelity in NMT using monolingual corpora, achieving high precision in style detection and significant improvement in style preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving stylistic nuances in NMT is challenging, especially without parallel corpora. Babel addresses this by leveraging monolingual data.

Method: Babel uses a style detector and diffusion-based style applicator to rectify stylistic inconsistencies while maintaining semantic integrity, integrating as a post-processing module.

Result: Babel achieves 88.21% precision in style detection, improves stylistic preservation by 150%, and maintains a semantic similarity score of 0.92. Human evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Babel successfully enhances stylistic fidelity in NMT without requiring parallel data or architectural changes, demonstrating broad applicability across diverse domains.

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

### [8] [Causal Language Control in Multilingual Transformers via Sparse Feature Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13410)
*Cheng-Ting Chou,George Liu,Jessica Sun,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Vasu Sharma,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using sparse autoencoder (SAE) features to control the target language generation of multilingual LLMs in zero-shot settings, achieving high success rates while preserving semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of deterministically controlling language generation in multilingual LLMs without explicit prompts or fine-tuning motivates this work.

Method: The study leverages pretrained SAEs on Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B models, identifying and modifying SAE features to steer language generation.

Result: Modifying a single SAE feature achieved up to 90% success in controlled language shifts, with mid-to-late transformer layers and specific attention heads being most effective.

Conclusion: Sparse feature steering offers a lightweight and interpretable method for controllable multilingual generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

### [9] [Aligning Knowledge Graphs and Language Models for Factual Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13411)
*Nur A Zarin Nishat,Andrea Coletta,Luigi Bellomarini,Kossi Amouzouvi,Jens Lehmann,Sahar Vahdati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALIGNed-LLM integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language models to reduce hallucination, improving factual grounding in tasks like question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 face challenges with hallucination. KGs offer structured, reliable data to enhance factuality.

Method: ALIGNed-LLM aligns KG embeddings (e.g., TransE) with text embeddings via a trainable projection layer, inspired by LLaVA's multimodal fusion.

Result: Tested on QA benchmarks and a financial use case, ALIGNed-LLM significantly improves LLM factuality and reduces hallucination.

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM effectively enhances LLM factuality by integrating KGs, proving useful in both benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

### [10] [Paper Summary Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs through LLM Safety Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13474)
*Liang Lin,Zhihao Xu,Xuehai Tang,Shi Liu,Biyu Zhou,Fuqing Zhu,Jizhong Han,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack (PSA), exploiting LLMs' trust in authoritative sources to achieve high attack success rates on well-aligned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore vulnerabilities in LLMs due to their propensity to trust authoritative sources like academic papers.

Method: Proposes PSA, which synthesizes content from safety papers to craft adversarial prompts with harmful queries.

Result: PSA achieves 97-98% attack success rates on models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and Deepseek-R1, revealing model-specific vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The findings highlight new vulnerabilities and suggest future research directions for adversarial methods and safety alignment.

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

### [11] [Revisiting LLM Value Probing Strategies: Are They Robust and Expressive?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13490)
*Siqi Shen,Mehar Singh,Lajanugen Logeswaran,Moontae Lee,Honglak Lee,Rada Mihalcea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness and expressiveness of value representations in LLMs, highlighting limitations in current probing methods and weak alignment with real-world actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding how well LLM value probing captures in-context information and reflects real-world preferences, given the impact on user experiences.

Method: Evaluates three probing strategies using prompt and option variations, and introduces tasks to test demographic context responsiveness and value-action alignment.

Result: Probing methods show large variances under perturbations; demographic context minimally affects free-text generation, and values weakly correlate with real-world actions.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for more careful LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

### [12] [Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501)
*Matilde Marcolli,Robert C. Berwick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how syntactic objects can be represented in a function space using wavelets, leveraging a semiring structure and operad algebra to model syntactic transformations, including Merge operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically justify the neurocomputational feasibility of syntactic structures by embedding them in a function space with mathematical rigor.

Method: Represent lexical items as wavelets in a function space, construct a semiring using Renyi entropy, and model syntactic operations via operad algebra and Hopf algebra Markov chains.

Result: A faithful representation of syntactic objects is achieved, with Merge operations implemented as cross-frequency phase synchronization, aligning with arithmetic successor functions.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for neurocomputational syntax, showing Merge can be realized mathematically and neurobiologically.

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for constructing conversational graphs in quasi-patterned dialogues, using the Filter & Reconnect method to improve semantic coherence and structural integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze conversational dynamics in large language model-based systems, addressing noise and structural clarity in loosely organized dialogues.

Method: Proposes the Filter & Reconnect method for graph simplification, leveraging large language models to enhance semantic metrics and enforce tree-like structures.

Result: Achieved a 2.06x increase in semantic metric S and enforced 0 Î´-hyperbolicity for optimal clarity.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable method for dialogue analysis, applicable to chatbots, dialogue management, and user behavior analytics.

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

TL;DR: Automated speech analysis integrating pause features and semantic coherence metrics improves FTD severity prediction in schizophrenia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clinical rating scales for FTD are resource-intensive and lack scalability; automated speech analysis offers a scalable alternative.

Method: Pause features from ASR and semantic coherence metrics were integrated across three datasets (AVH, TOPSY, PsyCL) and evaluated using SVR to predict FTD scores.

Result: Pause features alone robustly predicted FTD severity; integrating them with semantic coherence enhanced performance (best Ï = 0.649, AUC = 83.71%).

Conclusion: Combining temporal and semantic analyses refines FTD assessment and advances automated speech analysis in psychosis.

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

### [16] [Linguistic and Embedding-Based Profiling of Texts generated by Humans and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13614)
*Sergio E. Zanotto,Segun Aroyehun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes linguistic features to distinguish human-written and machine-generated texts, revealing simpler syntax and diverse semantics in human texts, and homogenization in newer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and differentiate human-written and machine-generated texts using linguistic features across various levels (morphology, syntax, semantics).

Method: Analyzed a dataset of texts from 8 domains and 11 LLMs, calculating features like dependency length and emotionality, and applying statistical analysis and style embeddings.

Result: Human texts show simpler syntax and more semantic diversity. Newer LLMs produce homogenized outputs with similar variability.

Conclusion: Human-written texts are linguistically distinct, while newer LLMs trend toward stylistic homogenization.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Seed-X is an open-source LLM family (7B parameters) excelling in multilingual translation, matching top closed-source models like GPT-4o and outperforming larger open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multilingual translation by leveraging diverse data and advanced techniques like CoT reasoning and RL.

Method: Pre-training on 28-language data, finetuning with CoT reasoning, and RL enhancement for generalization.

Result: Comparable to Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, outperforms larger open-source models in metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Seed-X advances multilingual translation research and applications, with publicly available parameters.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations
that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a
family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual
and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of
multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and
applications.

*Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CU-ICU customizes unsupervised language models for ICU datasets using T5, improving accuracy and interpretability with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in adapting large language models to healthcare due to domain adaptation and limited labeled data.

Method: Sparse fine-tuning with few-shot prompting and selective parameter updates, leveraging T5 architecture.

Result: 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy, 20% better clinical explanations, and fewer than 1% parameter updates.

Conclusion: CU-ICU is scalable and efficient for clinical decision support in ICU settings.

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled
data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised
instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering
accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU
environments.

### [19] [KiC: Keyword-inspired Cascade for Cost-Efficient Text Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13666)
*Woo-Chan Kim,Ji-Hoon Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KiC is a cost-efficient framework for free-form text generation, using a weaker model first and escalating to a stronger one based on semantic alignment, achieving near-GPT-4 accuracy with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing LLMs are costly via APIs, and existing cascade methods fail to reliably assess free-form outputs due to reliance on exact text matching.

Method: KiC identifies the most representative answer from a weaker model and evaluates semantic alignment of other responses to decide whether to escalate.

Result: KiC achieves 97.53% of GPT-4's accuracy, reduces API costs by 28.81%, and outperforms GPT-4 in one benchmark.

Conclusion: KiC offers a cost-effective solution for free-form text generation with high accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

### [20] [LoopServe: An Adaptive Dual-phase LLM Inference Acceleration System for Multi-Turn Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13681)
*Haoyang Li,Zhanchao Xu,Yiming Li,Xuejia Chen,Darian Li,Anxin Tian,Qingfa Xiao,Cheng Deng,Jun Wang,Qing Li,Lei Chen,Mingxuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoopServe is an adaptive dual-phase framework for accelerating large language models in multi-turn dialogues, using dynamic sparsification and progressive key value compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with computational and memory challenges in long conversations due to fixed heuristics.

Method: LoopServe dynamically sparsifies attention during prefilling and compresses key values adaptively during decoding.

Result: Outperforms baselines, significantly speeding up inference in long-context dialogue tasks.

Conclusion: LoopServe offers an efficient and adaptive solution for multi-turn dialogue acceleration.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

### [21] [Consistent Explainers or Unreliable Narrators? Understanding LLM-generated Group Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13705)
*Cedric Waterschoot,Nava Tintarev,Francesco Barile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in Group Recommender Systems (GRS) produce recommendations similar to Additive Utilitarian aggregation but with inconsistent explanations. Group structure doesn't affect recommendations, but LLMs introduce extra criteria. Findings highlight transparency and efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs as joint decision-makers and explanation generators in GRS by comparing them to social choice-based aggregation strategies.

Method: Comparison of LLM-generated recommendations and explanations with Additive Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation strategies, analyzing group structure and additional criteria introduced by LLMs.

Result: LLM recommendations resemble ADD aggregation, but explanations often refer to averaging ratings. Group structure doesn't impact recommendations, while LLMs introduce extra criteria like similarity or diversity. Explanations vary with rating numbers, indicating inefficiency in standard methods.

Conclusion: LLMs in GRS show promise but suffer from inconsistent explanations and transparency issues, questioning their reliability and the efficiency of standard aggregation methods for larger datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

### [22] [The Judge Variable: Challenging Judge-Agnostic Legal Judgment Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13732)
*Guillaume Zambrano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Machine learning predicts child custody outcomes in French courts, showing judges' individual patterns influence decisions, supporting legal realism. Specialist models outperform generalist ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption of judicial neutrality by examining if individual judges' decision-making patterns affect case outcomes.

Method: Uses 18,937 rulings from 10,306 cases, employing a hybrid approach with LLMs for feature extraction and ML models (RF, XGB, SVC) for prediction. Specialist models (judge-specific) vs. generalist models (aggregated data).

Result: Specialist models achieve higher accuracy (F1 up to 92.85%) than generalist models (82.63%), showing stable, non-transferable judge-specific patterns.

Conclusion: Judicial identity measurably impacts legal outcomes, supporting legal realism. Data and code will be shared.

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

### [23] [PRIDE -- Parameter-Efficient Reduction of Identity Discrimination for Equality in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13743)
*Maluna Menke,Thilo Hagendorff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LoRA and soft-prompt tuning to reduce LGBTQIA+ biases in LLMs, finding LoRA effective with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often reproduce biases against LGBTQIA+ identities, necessitating lightweight solutions for bias mitigation.

Method: Two PEFT techniques (LoRA and soft-prompt tuning) are tested on three LLMs using the WinoQueer benchmark and a QueerNews corpus.

Result: LoRA reduces bias scores by up to 50 points and increases neutrality to 36%, while soft-prompt tuning shows marginal improvements.

Conclusion: LoRA is a promising, efficient method for bias reduction, advocating for community-informed PEFT and larger queer-authored corpora.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

### [24] [Innocence in the Crossfire: Roles of Skip Connections in Jailbreaking Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13761)
*Palash Nandi,Maithili Joshi,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how prompt design in Visual Language Models (VLMs) can be exploited to generate inappropriate content, identifying three key factors and proposing a framework to increase jailbreak success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and exploit the sensitivity of VLMs to prompt formulations, particularly in generating inapt content, by analyzing discrete components of prompt design.

Method: Analyzed three factors: detailed visual information, adversarial examples, and positively framed phrases. Proposed a skip-connection framework for jailbreaks and tested with benign images and memes.

Result: VLMs struggle with multimodal inputs; each factor independently triggers jailbreaks. Memes are as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content.

Conclusion: VLMs have subtle vulnerabilities; the proposed framework increases jailbreak success, highlighting risks in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

*Enhao Cheng,Shoujia Zhang,Jianhua Yin,Xuemeng Song,Tian Gan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes GSDMM and its improved version GSDMM+ for short text clustering, addressing sparsity and high dimensionality while optimizing performance through noise reduction, adaptive word weighting, and cluster merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short text clustering is challenging due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and computational intensity. Existing methods (topic models and deep learning) have limitations.

Method: Proposes GSDMM (collapsed Gibbs Sampling for Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture) and GSDMM+ (improved with noise reduction, adaptive word weighting, and cluster merging).

Result: Experiments show GSDMM+ outperforms classical and state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: GSDMM+ offers a refined solution for short text clustering, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

*Hosein Azarbonyad,Zi Long Zhu,Georgios Cheirmpos,Zubair Afzal,Vikrant Yadav,Georgios Tsatsaronis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods for generating QA pairs from scientific articles: one using LLMs for direct content-based QA generation, and another leveraging a KG built from fine-tuned ER extraction. The KG-based approach better captures main ideas, and fine-tuning the ER model is key for quality triplet extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scholars need quick identification of key ideas in articles. The paper addresses this by generating QA pairs to summarize and highlight contributions.

Method: Two approaches: 1) LLM-based QA generation from salient paragraphs, and 2) KG-based QA generation using fine-tuned ER extraction and triplet saliency metrics.

Result: The KG-based approach effectively captures main ideas, and fine-tuning the ER model is crucial for high-quality triplet extraction.

Conclusion: The KG-based QA generation method is superior for summarizing scientific articles, with fine-tuned ER extraction being essential for accurate triplet selection.

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how linguistic expressions (first-person pronouns and negative words) relate to depression and anxiety in Chinese counseling sessions, finding a link with negative words but not pronouns, highlighting cultural and contextual influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of language in mental health within Chinese psycho-counseling, contrasting with Western findings.

Method: Analyzed 735 online counseling sessions using LIWC and a mixed-effect model to quantify linguistic patterns.

Result: Negative emotional words correlated with depression/anxiety severity; first-person pronoun usage did not vary with psychological states.

Conclusion: Cultural and conversational contexts shape language use in mental health, offering insights for Chinese therapeutic practices.

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

*Eitan Wagner,Renana Keydar,Omri Abend*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework for detective fiction defines fair play and metrics for it, revealing a tension between coherence and surprise. LLM-generated stories often fail to balance this trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the concept of fair play in detective fiction and analyze its balance with surprise, especially in LLM-generated stories.

Method: Develop a probabilistic framework to define fair play and metrics, then apply it to LLM-generated detective stories.

Result: LLM stories are unpredictable but struggle to balance surprise and fair play, leading to poor quality.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the challenge of balancing coherence and surprise in storytelling, particularly for LLMs.

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTraVisTo is a visualization tool for Transformer-based LLMs, helping researchers trace token generation and understand internal computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are unpredictable in production, with discrepancies between desired and actual behavior. Understanding their internal processes is challenging.

Method: InTraVisTo visualizes internal states (token embeddings per layer) and information flow (via Sankey diagrams) in Transformer models.

Result: The tool aids in tracing computational processes and uncovering patterns in LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: InTraVisTo enhances understanding of LLM computations, potentially improving their predictability and reliability.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses label unification challenges in cybersecurity NER, evaluates models on unified datasets, and proposes alternative architectures with limited success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized labels in cybersecurity NER makes combining datasets difficult, reducing usability.

Method: Coarse-grained label unification, BiLSTM evaluations, and proposed multihead and graph-based transfer models.

Result: Models trained on unified datasets generalize poorly; multihead and graph-based models show marginal or no significant improvements.

Conclusion: Label unification remains challenging, and alternative architectures offer limited gains, suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it
challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four
cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a
coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared
BERT-base-NER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching challenges ASR due to scarce training data and linguistic similarities, especially in multilingual societies like Catalan-Spanish.

Method: Three strategies: (1) synthetic CS data generation, (2) monolingual audio concatenation, (3) real CS data with language tokens. Fine-tuned OpenAI's Whisper models.

Result: Combining synthetic CS data with dominant language token yields best transcription performance.

Conclusion: Effective ASR for Catalan-Spanish CS achieved by blending synthetic and real data with language tokens.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

*Cole Walsh,Rodica Ivan,Muhammad Zafar Iqbal,Colleen Robb*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to automate scoring of open-response Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) for personal and professional skills, addressing scalability and validity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable systems to measure and develop personal and professional skills alongside technical expertise in academic programs.

Method: A novel approach using LLMs to extract construct-relevant features from SJT responses, demonstrated with the Casper SJT.

Result: The study shows the efficacy of LLMs in automating SJT scoring, addressing past issues with construct validity.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for future advancements in automated scoring of personal and professional skills.

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles text classification for political leaning and politicalness using transformer models, addressing poor generalization of current methods by compiling diverse datasets and benchmarking models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of siloed solutions and poor out-of-distribution performance in existing approaches for political text classification.

Method: Combines 12 datasets for political leaning and extends 18 datasets for politicalness, then benchmarks models using leave-one-in and leave-one-out methodologies.

Result: New models with enhanced generalization capabilities are trained and evaluated.

Conclusion: The approach improves generalization for political text classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

*Kobi Hackenburg,Ben M. Tappin,Luke Hewitt,Ed Saunders,Sid Black,Hause Lin,Catherine Fist,Helen Margetts,David G. Rand,Christopher Summerfield*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current and near-future AI's persuasive power stems more from post-training and prompting methods than personalization or scale, but these methods decrease factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fears about conversational AI's influence on human beliefs by evaluating the persuasiveness and factual accuracy of LLMs.

Method: Three large-scale experiments (N=76,977) deploying 19 LLMs, including some post-trained for persuasion, on 707 political issues, and checking 466,769 LLM claims for factual accuracy.

Result: Post-training and prompting boosted persuasiveness by up to 51% and 27%, respectively, but decreased factual accuracy. Persuasion relied on LLMs' strategic information deployment.

Conclusion: AI's persuasive power is more tied to post-training and prompting than scale or personalization, but these methods compromise factual accuracy.

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

### [36] [Exploiting Primacy Effect To Improve Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13949)
*Bianca Raimondi,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs exhibit amplified primacy bias in MCQA, which can be strategically leveraged by reordering answer options to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs, which affects MCQA accuracy due to the order of answer options.

Method: Reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without needing the correct answer.

Result: The approach significantly improves performance in MCQA.

Conclusion: Biases in LLMs can be both challenges and opportunities, providing insights for bias-aware model design in NLP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

### [37] [Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13966)
*Bhishma Dedhia,Yuval Kansal,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bottom-up approach using knowledge graphs (KGs) to train language models for domain-specific expertise, validated in medicine with significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional top-down training of language models lacks deep domain expertise, necessitating a bottom-up approach to compose domain concepts.

Method: A task generation pipeline synthesizes tasks from KG primitives, fine-tuning models like QwQ-32B to create QwQ-Med-3, evaluated on ICD-Bench.

Result: QwQ-Med-3 outperforms state-of-the-art models on ICD-Bench and transfers expertise to improve base model performance.

Conclusion: Domain-specific superintelligence via composable KGs could pave the way for AGI, contrasting broad expertise approaches.

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

*Lilit Grigoryan,Nikolay Karpov,Enas Albasiri,Vitaly Lavrukhin,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal methodology for Arabic ASR, training two FastConformer-based models for MSA and a unified MSA/CA model, achieving SOTA results and open-sourcing the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of attention to Arabic language variations and the scarcity of public ASR models for Arabic, especially beyond MSA.

Method: Develops a universal methodology for Arabic speech/text processing and trains two FastConformer models: one for MSA and another unified for MSA and CA.

Result: The MSA model sets a new SOTA benchmark, and the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy for CA with diacritics while performing well for MSA.

Conclusion: The work advances Arabic ASR by addressing language variations, providing open-source models, and setting new performance standards.

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

TL;DR: RHYTHM is a framework using LLMs for spatio-temporal prediction and trajectory reasoning, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human mobility prediction by leveraging LLMs while reducing computational costs.

Method: Partitions trajectories into daily tokens with hierarchical attention, uses pre-computed prompt embeddings, and freezes the LLM backbone.

Result: Achieves 2.4% higher accuracy, 5.0% better weekend performance, and 24.6% faster training.

Conclusion: RHYTHM effectively balances performance and efficiency for human mobility tasks.

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for
Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions
trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical
attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially
reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Jianfei Li,Kevin Kam Fung Yuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPC-CMS, a framework for selecting the best sentiment analysis model using expert-weighted criteria and a decision matrix. ALBERT performs best without time constraints, but no single model excels when time is considered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model selection for document-level sentiment analysis by incorporating expert judgment and multiple evaluation criteria.

Method: Uses CPC to weight criteria (accuracy, precision, etc.), tests baseline models (Naive Bayes, ALBERT, etc.), and forms a decision matrix to select the best model. Validated on three social media datasets.

Result: ALBERT is best without time constraints, but no consistent winner when time is included.

Conclusion: CPC-CMS is effective for sentiment analysis and adaptable to other classification tasks.

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance of various LLMs in biomedical tasks to guide optimal model selection for specific applications.

Method: Evaluated closed-source and open-source LLMs on tasks like text classification, generation, QA, and multimodal image processing.

Result: No single LLM consistently outperforms others; task-specific strengths observed, with open-source models sometimes matching or exceeding closed-source performance.

Conclusion: Model selection should be task-specific, with open-source LLMs offering competitive performance, speed, and privacy benefits.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and
image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on
tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question
answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate
that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative Rational Speech Act (CRSA), an extension of the RSA framework for multi-turn collaborative dialog, optimizing a gain function from rate-distortion theory. It shows improved consistency and collaboration in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems need to reason about shared goals and beliefs in collaborative roles, but existing RSA extensions struggle with multi-turn scenarios.

Method: CRSA extends RSA with an information-theoretic gain function for multi-turn dialog, considering private information and dialog context.

Result: CRSA outperforms baselines in referential games and medical dialogs, yielding more consistent and collaborative behavior.

Conclusion: CRSA advances pragmatic and socially aware AI language agents, demonstrating effectiveness in collaborative scenarios.

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

*Garapati Keerthana,Manik Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DENSE is a system for generating clinically coherent progress notes by leveraging LLMs and a retrieval strategy to align scattered EHR notes temporally and semantically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress notes are underrepresented in EHR datasets, creating gaps in patient narratives. DENSE aims to restore coherence by simulating physician workflows.

Method: DENSE uses fine-grained note categorization, temporal alignment, and a retrieval strategy to prompt an LLM for generating progress notes.

Result: Generated notes show strong longitudinal fidelity (temporal alignment ratio of 1.089) and outperform original notes in continuity.

Conclusion: DENSE offers a scalable solution for improving EHR documentation, aiding tasks like summarization and clinical decision support.

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The PLABA track evaluated LLMs for adapting biomedical literature into plain language, showing promise but highlighting gaps in simplicity, brevity, and automatic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make biomedical literature accessible to patients and caregivers by adapting it into plain language, while ensuring rigorous evaluation due to potential harm.

Method: Hosted the PLABA track with tasks for rewriting abstracts (Task 1) and replacing difficult terms (Task 2), using professional references and expert manual evaluation.

Result: Top models matched human factual accuracy but lacked simplicity and brevity. Automatic metrics poorly correlated with manual judgments. LLMs excelled in term replacement accuracy but struggled with brevity.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for plain language adaptation but need improvements in simplicity, brevity, and better automatic evaluation tools.

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

*Yang Zhou,Junjie Li,CongYang Ou,Dawei Yan,Haokui Zhang,Xizhe Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) in UAV aerial scenes, highlighting its potential to overcome limitations of traditional methods by leveraging cross-modal text-image alignment like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV aerial object detection methods are limited to predefined categories, restricting their applicability. OVOD, enabled by cross-modal alignment, allows detection of unseen objects via natural language, enhancing UAV intelligence.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review, aligning OVOD principles with UAV vision, categorizing existing methods, and analyzing datasets. Key challenges and open problems are identified.

Result: The survey provides a taxonomy of OVOD methods for aerial imagery, reviews datasets, and highlights challenges, offering a roadmap for future research.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a valuable reference for researchers, outlining future directions to advance OVOD in UAV applications, fostering innovation in the field.

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDNIG is a deep learning framework for low-light image enhancement using illumination guidance and multi-scale features, achieving competitive results with lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve low-light image enhancement by focusing on underexposed regions and handling diverse lighting conditions effectively.

Method: Uses a U-Net with illumination guidance from BCP, SPP for multi-scale features, Swish activation, and GAN optimization with composite loss.

Result: Competes with state-of-the-art methods in metrics and visual quality, with lower model complexity.

Conclusion: EDNIG is effective for real-world low-light image enhancement and is publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

Motivation: To evaluate VLMs' ability to perform nonlocal visual reasoning, a critical but overlooked aspect of vision-language understanding.

Method: Designed tasks isolating three forms of nonlocal reasoning: comparative perception, saccadic search, and smooth visual search. Tested flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini).

Result: Models performed poorly, barely exceeding random accuracy, despite excelling in other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack core visual reasoning capabilities, revealing a significant limitation in their design.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

### [48] [Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13362)
*Binbin Ji,Siddharth Agrawal,Qiance Tang,Yvonne Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores spatial reasoning in VLMs using CoT prompting and reinforcement learning, finding structured SceneGraph CoT and GRPO fine-tuning improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) through effective prompting and reinforcement learning techniques.

Method: Evaluated CoT prompting strategies, introduced SceneGraph CoT for structured reasoning, and fine-tuned models using GRPO on the SAT dataset, comparing it to SFT.

Result: SceneGraph CoT outperforms simple CoT, and GRPO achieves higher accuracy and robustness than SFT, especially under OOD conditions.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and reinforcement learning (GRPO) significantly enhance VLMs' spatial reasoning and generalization, with open-source code provided.

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D object detection datasets are limited by narrow class taxonomies and expensive annotations, hindering scalability to open-world scenarios.

Method: The pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector for text-conditioned proposals, segments them with SAM, and back-projects into 3D using camera geometry and pseudo-depth. Geometric inflation with DBSCAN and Rotating Calipers infers 3D bounding boxes without training.

Result: The method achieves competitive localization performance in LiDAR-based and RGB-D settings, remaining training-free and open-vocabulary.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D perception, with code and resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results

algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures like YOLO and DETR struggle with feature consistency across scales and balancing precision with computational efficiency in dynamic environments.

Method: Butter introduces FAFCE for feature consistency via adaptive frequency filtering and PHFFNet for progressive hierarchical feature fusion.

Result: Experiments on BDD100K, KITTI, and Cityscapes show improved detection accuracy and reduced complexity.

Conclusion: Butter balances accuracy, deployability, and efficiency, advancing real-time object detection for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like dense text captions are costly and miss critical visual information, prompting the need for a smarter routing system.

Method: ModaRoute uses GPT-4.1 to analyze query intent and route queries across ASR, OCR, and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query.

Result: The system achieves 60.9% Recall@5, reduces computational overhead by 41%, and demonstrates scalability on 1.8M video clips.

Conclusion: ModaRoute offers a practical, cost-effective solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems without sacrificing effectiveness.

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inspection methods are inadequate for modern manufacturing demands, necessitating advancements in defect detection techniques.

Method: The survey analyzes closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies in 2D and 3D modalities, tracking their evolution and challenges.

Result: Open-set techniques are gaining prominence, reducing the need for extensive annotations and improving anomaly recognition.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive overview of industrial defect detection, emphasizing emerging trends and practical challenges in the field.

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing

*Arjun Rao,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the benefits of integrating additional geospatial data layers with optical satellite imagery in supervised learning tasks, finding significant performance improvements, especially in data-limited and out-of-sample scenarios. Hard-coded fusion strategies outperformed learned methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the value of combining non-optical geospatial data (e.g., elevation, temperature) with optical satellite imagery in machine learning models, as most current models focus solely on optical inputs.

Method: Augmented benchmark tasks for satellite imagery machine learning (SatML) by adding extra geospatial data layers. Evaluated performance across classification, regression, and segmentation tasks.

Result: Fusing additional geographic inputs with optical imagery improved model performance, particularly with limited labeled data and in out-of-sample settings. Hard-coded fusion worked better than learned strategies.

Conclusion: Multi-modal inputs enhance data efficiency and out-of-sample performance in SatML models, with hard-coded fusion being unexpectedly effective, suggesting directions for future research.

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A minimalist method for concept erasure in generative models preserves utility while addressing safety and copyright concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety and copyright issues in generative models without excessive modifications that degrade performance.

Method: Formulates a concept erasure objective based on distributional distance of outputs, uses differentiable optimization with backpropagation, and incorporates neuron masking.

Result: Robustly erases concepts without degrading model performance, as shown in evaluations on flow-matching models.

Conclusion: The method enables safer and more responsible generative models by effectively erasing unwanted concepts.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework leverages binary occupancy data for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, improving performance in pre-training and auto-labeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs of annotated LiDAR data for semantic occupancy prediction motivate the use of cheaper binary occupancy data.

Method: The framework decomposes prediction into binary and semantic occupancy modules to utilize binary data effectively.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in pre-training and auto-labeling, enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Conclusion: Binary occupancy data can significantly improve 3D semantic occupancy prediction cost-effectively.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook specific interaction patterns like paired walking or conflicts, limiting accuracy in crowded scenarios.

Method: Proposes InSyn, a Transformer-based model, and the SSOS training strategy to capture interaction patterns and reduce initial-step divergence.

Result: Outperforms baselines on ETH and UCY datasets, especially in high-density scenarios, with SSOS reducing initial-step error by ~6.58%.

Conclusion: InSyn and SSOS effectively address interaction modeling and initial-step divergence, enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of diffusion models in grounded visual editing and compositional control, leveraging self-supervised learning and in-context generative modeling.

Method: Proposes MADI with MAgD (a dual corruption process combining denoising and masked reconstruction) and Pause Tokens for inference-time scaling.

Result: MADI improves editability, compositionality, and controllability of diffusion models, enabling localized and structure-aware editing.

Conclusion: MADI advances diffusion models for general-purpose, in-context generative architectures, enhancing their practical applicability.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive dataset capturing gradual changes in driver drowsiness using diverse signals, addressing limitations of existing datasets with discrete labels.

Method: Data collection involved 3D facial video, IR camera footage, biometric signals (heart rate, EDA, SpO2, skin temperature, accelerometer), grip sensor data, and telemetry from a truck simulator. Drowsiness levels were self-reported using KSS every 4 minutes.

Result: A dataset with 1,400 minutes of continuous multimodal data, recording gradual state changes in drivers.

Conclusion: The dataset offers a richer resource for drowsiness detection research by integrating diverse signals and continuous monitoring.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

TL;DR: AortaDiff is a diffusion-based framework for generating smooth, CFD-compatible 3D aortic surfaces from CT/MRI volumes, reducing reliance on large datasets and manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D aortic construction is essential for clinical and CFD applications, but existing methods require extensive manual work and large datasets, often producing inconsistent results.

Method: AortaDiff uses a volume-guided conditional diffusion model to generate aortic centerlines, extracts vessel contours, and fits them into smooth 3D surfaces.

Result: AortaDiff effectively constructs CFD-compatible meshes, even with limited training data, handling both normal and pathological cases like aneurysms.

Conclusion: AortaDiff is a practical, end-to-end solution for high-fidelity aortic mesh generation, advancing cardiovascular research.

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on VQA but lack testing for visual entailment, especially in crowded scenes.

Method: Proposed COREVQA with 5608 image and synthetic true/false statement pairs derived from CrowdHuman dataset.

Result: Top VLMs scored below 80% accuracy, others ranged 39.98%-69.95%, highlighting reasoning limitations.

Conclusion: VLMs struggle with visual entailment in crowded scenes, indicating a need for improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

*Vinu Sankar Sadasivan,Mehrdad Saberi,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IConMark is a novel semantic watermarking method for AI-generated images, embedding interpretable concepts to combat adversarial attacks and misinformation. It outperforms traditional methods in robustness and human-readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI and synthetic media necessitates reliable methods to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones, as traditional watermarking is vulnerable to attacks.

Method: IConMark embeds meaningful semantic attributes into AI-generated images, making watermarks interpretable and resilient. It also combines with StegaStamp and TrustMark for enhanced robustness.

Result: IConMark and its variants achieve 10.8% to 15.9% higher AUROC scores for watermark detection compared to baselines.

Conclusion: IConMark offers a robust, interpretable solution for watermarking AI-generated images, with potential for integration with existing techniques.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI-driven multi-model deep learning system achieves high accuracy (95.5%) in detecting shoulder fractures in X-rays, outperforming individual models and showing clinical potential for rapid screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shoulder fractures are often missed in emergency settings, leading to diagnostic delays. AI tools can provide scalable early detection.

Method: Developed a multi-model system (Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, RF-DETR) using 10,000 annotated X-rays, enhanced with ensemble techniques like Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion.

Result: NMW ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and F1-score of 0.9610, with strong recall and localization precision.

Conclusion: Ensemble-based AI reliably detects shoulder fractures, suitable for clinical integration, though limited to binary detection for rapid screening.

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

*Alessandro Pistola,Valentina Orru',Nicolo' Marchetti,Marco Roccetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Upgrading a deep learning model with CORONA satellite imagery improved archaeological site detection in transformed landscapes, achieving high accuracy and identifying new sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI models for identifying archaeological sites in landscapes altered or destroyed over decades.

Method: Retrained a Bing-based convolutional network using CORONA satellite imagery for Abu Ghraib, Mesopotamia.

Result: Increased detection precision (IoU >85%, accuracy 90%) and identified four new archaeological sites.

Conclusion: AI and CORONA imagery are effective for discovering vanished archaeological sites, offering breakthroughs in landscape studies.

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

*Sirui Wang,Zhou Guan,Bingxi Zhao,Tongjia Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer, improves driving intention prediction by modeling causal interactions between driver behavior and environment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to accurately model complex spatio-temporal dependencies and variability in human driving behavior, limiting autonomous driving safety and efficiency.

Method: CaSTFormer uses Reciprocal Shift Fusion for temporal alignment, Causal Pattern Extraction to remove spurious correlations, and a Feature Synthesis Network for coherent inference.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on the Brain4Cars dataset, capturing causal dependencies and improving prediction accuracy and transparency.

Conclusion: CaSTFormer advances driving intention prediction by addressing spatio-temporal and causal modeling challenges, enhancing autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

TL;DR: PhyWorldBench is a benchmark to evaluate video generation models' adherence to physics laws, testing 12 models across 1,050 prompts, including 'Anti-Physics' scenarios. It identifies challenges and offers prompt-crafting recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with accurately simulating physical phenomena, necessitating a benchmark to assess and improve their physics realism.

Method: PhyWorldBench evaluates models using curated prompts (fundamental, composite, anti-physics) and employs human evaluation and a zero-shot MLLM-based method.

Result: The study reveals key challenges in models' physics adherence and provides insights into prompt design for better physical fidelity.

Conclusion: PhyWorldBench highlights gaps in physics simulation by video models and suggests targeted improvements for future development.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

### [69] [Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Aerial and UAV Photogrammetry through Error Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13486)
*Debao Huang,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for quantifying uncertainty in photogrammetric point clouds, addressing gaps in MVS stage uncertainty estimation with a self-calibrating method using reliable n-view points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photogrammetric point clouds lack standardized uncertainty quantification in the MVS stage, unlike SfM, due to its non-differentiable nature.

Method: Proposes a self-calibrating method using reliable n-view points (n>=6) to regress disparity uncertainty with MVS cues like matching cost values.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust, certifiable uncertainty quantification for photogrammetric point clouds across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect stress in sugar-beet fields without labeled data, leveraging the spectral and temporal richness of SITS.

Method: A 3D convolutional autoencoder with temporal encodings extracts features from Sentinel-2 sequences, followed by clustering.

Result: The system detects stressed fields and generalizes across different years.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, unsupervised tool for sugar-beet stress detection.

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data has proven effective for agricultural
tasks due to its rich spectral and temporal nature. In this study, we tackle
the task of stress detection in sugar-beet fields using a fully unsupervised
approach. We propose a 3D convolutional autoencoder model to extract meaningful
features from Sentinel-2 image sequences, combined with
acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream
clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress
detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering
a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model, accelerates conductivity mapping of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM scans, reducing acquisition time by 11x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow data acquisition of traditional C-AFM techniques hinders large-scale production of 2D materials, necessitating faster, AI-assisted metrology.

Method: SparseC-AFM uses deep learning to reconstruct conductivity maps from sparse C-AFM scans, validated across various conditions and substrates.

Result: Achieves 11x faster acquisition than manual full-resolution C-AFM, with comparable accuracy in extracting material parameters like defect density and film coverage.

Conclusion: SparseC-AFM bridges the gap between lab research and industrial fabrication, offering efficient, AI-driven 2D material characterization.

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend discrete TGV models to manifold-valued functions (unit sphere) for improved mesh denoising.

Method: Construct a tangential Raviart-Thomas finite element space for normal vectors on triangular meshes.

Result: The new regularizer is evaluated in mesh denoising experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method extends TGV to manifold settings and shows promise for mesh denoising.

Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the second-order total generalized
variation (TGV) of the normal vector on an oriented, triangular mesh embedded
in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The normal vector is considered as a manifold-valued
function, taking values on the unit sphere. Our formulation extends previous
discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a
Raviart-Thomas function space. To exctend this formulation to the manifold
setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods
in mesh denoising experiments.

TL;DR: NABLA introduces a Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism to reduce computational overhead in video diffusion transformers while maintaining generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of full attention in transformers is a bottleneck for high-resolution and long-duration video generation.

Method: Proposes NABLA, a block-wise attention mechanism with adaptive sparsity-driven thresholds, compatible with PyTorch's Flex Attention.

Result: Achieves up to 2.7x faster training/inference with minimal impact on quality metrics (CLIP, VBench, human evaluation).

Conclusion: NABLA efficiently addresses computational bottlenecks in video generation without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

TL;DR: A LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework improves continual learning in vision-language models by adapting Stable Diffusion with task-specific low-rank adapters and confidence-based sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic-replay methods generate misaligned samples due to domain-specific nuances, undermining knowledge retention.

Method: Proposes a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection and LoRA-enhanced Stable Diffusion for task-specific adaptation.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on the MTIL benchmark, balancing plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability.

Conclusion: LoRA adaptation effectively enhances synthetic-replay for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-quality scanning devices produce noisy point clouds, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. The goal is to address this challenge by leveraging noisy data for learning.

Method: The method introduces NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, minimizing MSE loss between noisy SDF representations to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations.

Result: Evaluated on ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets, the framework significantly enhances surface reconstruction quality from noisy inputs.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF effectively extends denoising to 3D neural fields, improving reconstruction accuracy from noisy point clouds.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the

*Chengxu Liu,Lu Qi,Jinshan Pan,Xueming Qian,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model (DM)-based framework, dubbed \ours, is proposed for unsupervised image deblurring using unpaired data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is practical but challenging due to the complexity of real-world blur patterns. Existing adversarial learning approaches are insufficient.

Method: The framework uses a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) with a memory mechanism for DM training and a Texture Transfer Transformer (TTformer) with Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) for blur removal. A wavelet-based adversarial loss preserves texture details.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the method outperforms SOTA techniques in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a promising unsupervised solution for image deblurring by leveraging texture priors and adaptive filtering.

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model is proposed for burst SR to produce sharp, high-fidelity images, improving efficiency with a stochastic sampler and one-step diffusion, reducing runtime to 1.6% of baseline while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior burst SR methods produce blurry images due to deterministic training, which degrades perceptual quality. The goal is to reconstruct sharp, high-fidelity SR images.

Method: Uses a diffusion model with a stochastic sampler (high-order ODE) and one-step diffusion via knowledge distillation to enhance efficiency.

Result: Reduces runtime to 1.6% of baseline while preserving SR quality in terms of image distortion and perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances efficiency and quality in burst SR, addressing blurriness and perceptual degradation.

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: CoTasks introduces a framework for enhancing VideoLLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning by decomposing complex video questions into four foundational tasks, improving performance on benchmarks like NeXT-QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs lack fine-grained object-level understanding and structured annotations for step-by-step reasoning, limiting their compositional reasoning abilities.

Method: CoTasks decomposes video questions into frame localization, entity tracking, and spatiotemporal relation extraction, embedding intermediate reasoning steps into inputs.

Result: LLaVA-video-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-3B show significant performance improvements (+3.3 and +17.4 points, respectively) on the NeXT-QA benchmark.

Conclusion: CoTasks effectively enhances compositional video reasoning through structured chain-of-thought supervision.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:

decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

### [79] [Moving Object Detection from Moving Camera Using Focus of Expansion Likelihood and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13628)
*Masahiro Ogawa,Qi An,Atsushi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoELS integrates optical flow and texture to separate moving objects in complex scenes with camera motion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optical flow-based methods struggle in complex, structured scenes with camera motion, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: FoELS combines focus of expansion (FoE) computation from optical flow with texture-based segmentation to estimate moving object probability.

Result: FoELS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS 2016 and real-world traffic videos.

Conclusion: FoELS effectively addresses challenges in separating moving objects, proving superior in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

### [80] [EPSilon: Efficient Point Sampling for Lightening of Hybrid-based 3D Avatar Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13648)
*Seungjun Moon,Sangjoon Yu,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPSilon introduces efficient point sampling strategies (ERO and EIO) to reduce computational costs in hybrid NeRF-SMPL avatar generation, achieving faster inference and training while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid NeRF-SMPL models for avatar generation are computationally expensive due to unnecessary point sampling in empty space, leading to slow inference.

Method: Proposes EPSilon with two sampling strategies: Empty Ray Omission (ERO) and Empty Interval Omission (EIO) to skip empty regions during rendering.

Result: EPSilon uses only 3.9% of sampled points, achieves 20x faster inference, and 4x faster training convergence without quality loss.

Conclusion: EPSilon significantly improves efficiency in hybrid avatar generation, making it practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvReID, a large-scale RGB-event person ReID dataset, and proposes TriPro-ReID, a contrastive learning framework leveraging pedestrian attributes for improved feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and generalization issues in event camera-based person ReID by providing a comprehensive dataset and benchmarking existing methods.

Method: Creation of the EvReID dataset with 118,988 image pairs and 1200 identities, followed by proposing TriPro-ReID, an attribute-guided contrastive learning framework.

Result: TriPro-ReID outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods on EvReID and MARS datasets, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust dataset and framework for future research in RGB-event person ReID, enhancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

TL;DR: PW-FNet, a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier network, improves image restoration by combining wavelet-based multi-scale decomposition and Fourier transforms, outperforming existing methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather degrades image quality, hindering downstream tasks. Existing transformer-based methods are complex and inefficient for real-time use. PW-FNet addresses this by leveraging Wavelet-Fourier processing.

Method: PW-FNet uses pyramid wavelet decomposition for multi-scale analysis and Fourier transforms to replace self-attention, reducing complexity while maintaining global modeling.

Result: PW-FNet excels in tasks like deraining, dehazing, and super-resolution, achieving better quality and efficiency than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PW-FNet offers a novel, efficient baseline for image restoration, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

### [83] [MaskHOI: Robust 3D Hand-Object Interaction Estimation via Masked Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13673)
*Yuechen Xie,Haobo Jiang,Jian Yang,Yigong Zhang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskHOI is a Masked Autoencoder-based framework for 3D hand-object interaction pose estimation, using region-specific masking and SDF-driven learning to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 3D HOI tasks include geometric ambiguity and severe occlusions in monocular RGB images.

Method: Proposes MaskHOI with region-specific masking ratios and skeleton-driven hand masking, plus masked SDF-driven multimodal learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MaskHOI effectively addresses occlusion and geometric challenges in 3D HOI pose estimation.

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeCoFuse is a unified framework for V2X cooperative perception, addressing heterogeneous sensor setups with adaptive feature fusion and learning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous sensor configurations in V2X systems challenge feature fusion and perception reliability, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: HeCoFuse uses hierarchical fusion with channel-wise and spatial attention, adaptive spatial resolution adjustment, and cooperative learning for dynamic fusion.

Result: Achieves 43.22% 3D mAP (LC+LC) and up to 43.38% (L+LC), outperforming baselines across nine configurations.

Conclusion: HeCoFuse is state-of-the-art for V2X cooperative perception, validated by CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge success.

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

*Hongyi Liu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Gaussian kernel-based method for high-precision, sub-pixel-level motion measurement in structural health monitoring, eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, low-cost, and scalable motion measurement in structural health monitoring, where current vision-based methods lack precision or require extensive manual tuning.

Method: Developed a Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, incorporating motion consistency and super-resolution constraints for accuracy and robustness.

Result: Achieves high accuracy consistently without customized parameter setups, validated through numerical and experimental tests.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable, automated solution for sub-pixel-level motion measurement in structural health monitoring.

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two quasi-metrics for evaluating multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms, extending GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics with flexible cost penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing MOT performance metrics by allowing asymmetric costs for missed/false objects and non-symmetric localization errors.

Method: Proposes two quasi-metrics: one for object set discrepancies (extended GOSPA) and another for trajectory discrepancies (extended T-GOSPA), incorporating flexible cost structures.

Result: Demonstrates the utility of the T-GOSPA quasi-metric in assessing Bayesian MOT algorithms through simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed quasi-metrics offer enhanced flexibility for MOT evaluation, particularly in applications requiring asymmetric cost penalties.

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel training-free method, PoemTale Diffusion, improves image generation for poetic texts by refining prompts and modifying self-attention in diffusion models. The P4I dataset and expert evaluations validate its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with creative, abstract language like poetry, losing nuanced meanings. This work addresses this gap for poetic verse.

Method: Integrates a multi-stage prompt refinement loop into language models and modifies self-attention in diffusion models for consistent image generation.

Result: Human and quantitative evaluations confirm the method's efficacy, with improved information capture in generated images.

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion offers a novel approach to poem-to-image generation, enhancing interpretability and creative expression.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is effective for creating immersive AR experiences in museums, overcoming challenges in artwork reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative augmented reality pipeline tailored for
museum environments, aimed at recognizing artworks and generating accurate 3D

Depth-Anything for detailed local reconstruction, the proposed approach
produces optimized depth maps that effectively represent complex artistic

TL;DR: The paper analyzes StyleGAN's generator, revealing weight pruning reduces computational needs without major output loss, and explores latent vector manipulation for precise facial feature control, raising ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand StyleGAN's inner workings and its potential for misuse in generating realistic synthetic faces.

Method: Analyzes StyleGAN's architecture, trains a model with PyTorch, prunes weights, and examines latent vector effects on facial features.

Result: Many weights can be pruned without significant output degradation, and latent vector manipulation allows precise control over facial traits.

Conclusion: The study highlights StyleGAN's efficiency and ethical risks, emphasizing the need for safeguards against misuse.

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Motivation: Addressing the challenges of few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) with limited data and avoiding catastrophic forgetting while learning new information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100, preserving performance on old classes and adapting well to new ones.

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL effectively tackles FSCIL challenges by leveraging a generative model's strengths, achieving superior performance with efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in T2V synthesis like flickering and artifacts by leveraging pre-trained T2I and T2V models.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based T2I model to refine frames and T2V backbones for motion consistency, encapsulating their strengths.

Result: Improved video quality and motion smoothness, with 1.6x-4.5x faster inference.

Conclusion: EVS effectively combines T2I and T2V models, enhancing video synthesis without training.

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

Motivation: Existing deep learning-based HSI reconstruction methods struggle to accurately capture high-frequency details.

Method: Uses a diffusion model to learn an implicit Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) and introduces SPIM to dynamically guide HSI detail recovery.

Result: Outperforms MST and BISRNet by ~0.5 dB in HSI reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed SDP and SPIM significantly improve HSI reconstruction performance by better capturing high-frequency details.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

Motivation: Existing VQA research focuses on rephrasing questions but ignores interactive clarification, which is natural in user-VLM interactions. Lack of benchmarks and VLMs' preference for answering over asking hinder progress.

Method: The authors introduce the ClearVQA benchmark, targeting three common ambiguity categories in VQA, to evaluate VLMs' interactive clarification capabilities.

Result: ClearVQA provides a framework to assess and improve VLMs' ability to handle ambiguities through interaction, covering diverse VQA scenarios.

Conclusion: ClearVQA addresses critical challenges in interactive VQA, paving the way for more effective ambiguity resolution in VLMs.

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

*Abhijit Sen,Giridas Maiti,Bikram K. Parida,Bhanu P. Mishra,Mahima Arya,Denys I. Bondar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel feature extraction method for image classification using Permutation Entropy (PE) combined with HOG and LBP, achieving competitive performance on benchmark datasets without deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and computationally efficient alternatives to deep learning models in image classification.

Method: Extends PE to 2D images, integrates HOG and LBP for feature extraction, and trains SVM classifiers with a 780-dimensional feature set.

Result: Competitive classification performance on Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: The fusion of PE with HOG and LBP offers a lightweight, interpretable, and effective solution for image classification, demonstrating the potential of entropy-based descriptors.

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable clustering module for SSL and UDA, leveraging supervised data to compute centroids, showing effectiveness in low supervision regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance SSL and UDA performance by explicitly enforcing the clustering assumption, unlike implicit methods in prior works.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end training strategy with a differentiable clustering module, using supervised data for centroid computation.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in SSL and UDA, especially in low supervision, as a standalone model and regularizer.

Conclusion: The explicit clustering approach improves performance and is versatile for SSL and UDA tasks.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoFNO, a 3D neural operator, enhances hemodynamic analysis by improving spatiotemporal resolution and predicting WSS from clinical imaging, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low spatiotemporal resolution and SNR in MRI flow imaging limit its diagnostic utility for aneurysm rupture prediction and treatment guidance.

Method: LoFNO integrates Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors and uses EDSR for upsampling, combining neural operators to de-noise and upsample flow data.

Result: LoFNO achieves superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation and other deep learning methods.

Conclusion: LoFNO enables more precise cerebrovascular diagnostics by enhancing resolution and accuracy in hemodynamic analysis.

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

*Huu-Phu Do,Yu-Wei Chen,Yi-Cheng Liao,Chi-Wei Hsiao,Han-Yang Wang,Wei-Chen Chiu,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynFaceRestore introduces a dynamic approach to blind face restoration, balancing fidelity and quality by dynamically selecting diffusion timesteps and adjusting guidance scales locally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed diffusion sampling and global guidance, leading to imbalances in fidelity and quality due to uniform degradation assumptions.

Method: DynFaceRestore maps degraded inputs to Gaussian blurry images, dynamically selects timesteps, and uses closed-form guidance with local dynamic scaling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, balancing fidelity and quality effectively.

Conclusion: DynFaceRestore is robust and effective for blind face restoration, addressing limitations of fixed methods.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated pipeline mines high-quality image-text triplets for training generative models, enabling large-scale data without human labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of acquiring pixel-accurate, high-fidelity image-text triplets for training generative models due to the lack of robust automated metrics.

Method: Uses a modular pipeline with a Gemini validator for scoring instruction adherence and aesthetics, leveraging inversion and compositional bootstrapping to expand the dataset.

Result: Produces NHR-Edit, a dataset of 358k high-quality triplets, surpassing public alternatives, and Bagel-NHR-Edit, a fine-tuned model with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Automation enables scalable, high-quality training data, democratizing research in generative modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

TL;DR: CF-SSC is a temporal SSC framework using pseudo-future frame prediction to enhance 3D scene completion from 2D images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular SSC methods struggle with occlusions and limited field of view in real-world traffic scenarios.

Method: Combines poses and depths for accurate 3D correspondences, fusing past, present, and predicted future frames in 3D space with a 3D-aware architecture.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, improving occlusion reasoning and accuracy.

Conclusion: CF-SSC effectively addresses limitations of monocular SSC by leveraging temporal data, enhancing 3D scene completion.

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAM-MAMBA is a framework for efficient and robust multi-modal fusion in IoT, addressing challenges like high complexity, unidirectional alignment, and missing data. It uses Mamba for time-series processing, GRAM matrix for alignment, and a LoRA-inspired strategy for missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal fusion systems in IoT face issues like high complexity, poor alignment, and lack of robustness to missing data, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: GRAM-MAMBA combines Mamba for efficient time-series processing, GRAM matrix for pairwise modality alignment, and a LoRA-inspired adaptive layer strategy for handling missing modalities.

Result: On SPAWC2021 and USC-HAD datasets, GRAM-MAMBA outperforms baselines with lower error, higher accuracy (93.55% F1, 93.81% OA), and a 24.5% performance boost for missing modalities.

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA demonstrates efficient and robust multi-modal fusion, making it suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MM-RSFMs require separate backbones per modality and use generic SSL, ignoring RS data traits like complex semantics.

Method: Single transformer backbone, novel SSL for RS, adaptive patch merging, learnable modality prompts, and MoE module.

Result: Outperforms SkySense by 1.8 points on 16 datasets across 7 tasks.

Conclusion: SkySense V2 offers efficient, unified multi-modal handling with superior performance, addressing RS-specific challenges.

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal

address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for
future Video-LMM development.

Motivation: Accurate building segmentation in dense urban regions is challenging due to large, high-resolution satellite images. The study aims to enhance segmentation using quantum-assisted methods.

Method: Quanvolutional pre-processing is applied to SAR imagery to extract informative features, combined with Attention U-Net for segmentation.

Result: The method matches standard Attention U-Net accuracy while reducing network parameters, improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Quantum-assisted Deep Learning shows promise for efficient, large-scale urban building segmentation.

Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban
planning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting
buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that

TL;DR: Depth3DLane is a dual-pathway framework for monocular 3D lane detection, integrating self-supervised depth estimation to avoid reliance on expensive sensors or ground-truth depth data. It achieves competitive performance and extends to predict camera parameters per-frame.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for monocular 3D lane detection rely on costly sensors or impractical ground-truth depth data, and assume known camera parameters, limiting scalability and applicability.

Method: Depth3DLane combines a self-supervised depth network for point cloud generation with dual pathways (bird's-eye view for spatial info, front view for semantic info) and 3D lane anchors for feature sampling. It also predicts camera parameters per-frame.

Result: Depth3DLane performs competitively on the OpenLane benchmark and works without ground-truth camera parameters, enabling use in calibration-infeasible scenarios.

Conclusion: Depth3DLane addresses key limitations of existing methods, offering a scalable, sensor-free solution for monocular 3D lane detection with robust performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image customization lacks fine-grained spatial control due to missing datasets linking identity with precise positions.

Method: PositionIC uses a scalable synthesis pipeline with bidirectional generation and a positional modulation layer to decouple spatial embeddings.

Result: The approach achieves accurate spatial control and high consistency in image customization.

Conclusion: PositionIC enables controllable, high-fidelity customization in open-world scenarios and will be released for further research.

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle conflicts between internal knowledge and external visual inputs, identifying specific model heads that control these conflicts and demonstrating methods to steer the model's responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal and external sources, leading to unreliable outputs. The study aims to understand and control these interactions.

Method: The authors introduce a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries, use logit inspection to localize conflict-controlling heads, and modify these heads to steer model behavior.

Result: A small set of heads was identified to control knowledge conflicts. Modifying these heads allowed steering the model's reliance on internal knowledge or visual inputs. Attention from these heads also outperformed gradient-based attribution in pinpointing image regions.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into conflict resolution in VLMs, offering methods to control model behavior and improve reliability by targeting specific heads.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing

achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural

enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a

TL;DR: PCR-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by co-regularizing camera poses using feature reprojection and wavelet-based frequency regularization, handling complex camera trajectories better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COLMAP-free 3D-GS struggles with complex camera trajectories, leading to degraded pose estimation and optimization issues.

Method: PCR-GS uses feature reprojection (DINO features) and wavelet-based frequency regularization to co-regularize camera poses.

Result: PCR-GS outperforms in pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling, especially under dramatic camera trajectory changes.

Conclusion: PCR-GS offers a robust solution for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction without relying on COLMAP, even in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

### [109] [Enhancing LiDAR Point Features with Foundation Model Priors for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13899)
*Yujian Mo,Yan Wu,Junqiao Zhao,Jijun Wang,Yinghao Hu,Jun Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances LiDAR-based 3D object detection by integrating depth priors from DepthAnything, improving point feature expressiveness and detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially weak reflectance attributes, by leveraging dense depth priors from monocular RGB images.

Method: Fuses depth priors with LiDAR attributes, introduces a point-wise feature extraction module, and employs a Dual-Path RoI framework with a bidirectional gated fusion module.

Result: Improved detection accuracy on the KITTI benchmark, validating the integration of visual foundation model priors.

Conclusion: Incorporating depth priors from visual foundation models significantly enhances LiDAR-based 3D object detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

*Hsiang-Hui Hung,Huu-Phu Do,Yung-Hui Li,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF is a neural rendering method for generating novel views at arbitrary times and viewpoints with few input views, leveraging NeRF and disentanglement strategies for generalizability and smooth temporal transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of collecting multiple views and re-optimizing for unseen scenes, and the need for immersive 3D environments that transition naturally between day and night.

Method: Combines multi-view stereo, neural radiance fields (NeRF), and disentanglement strategies to create an implicit content radiance field for scene representation and temporal modeling.

Result: TimeNeRF renders novel views in few-shot settings without per-scene optimization, capturing natural scene changes like dawn to dusk.

Conclusion: TimeNeRF advances temporal 3D scene modeling, enabling realistic and smooth transitions in novel views with minimal input.

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

### [111] [DiViD: Disentangled Video Diffusion for Static-Dynamic Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13934)
*Marzieh Gheisari,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiViD is a video diffusion framework for disentangling static and dynamic content in videos, outperforming existing methods with explicit factorization and reduced leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches suffer from information leakage and blurry reconstructions, hindering effective disentanglement of static and dynamic video content.

Method: DiViD uses a sequence encoder for static-dynamic factorization, a conditional DDPM decoder with shared-noise schedules, time-varying KL bottlenecks, and cross-attention, plus an orthogonality regularizer.

Result: DiViD achieves the highest swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity, improves dynamic transfer, and reduces cross-leakage compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DiViD is a robust framework for disentangling static and dynamic video content, addressing key limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework links vision models' perceptual ability to forecasting performance, using latent diffusion models for feature prediction and lightweight readouts for task-specific decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the correlation between vision models' perceptual ability and forecasting performance, aiming to bridge representation learning and generative modeling for video understanding.

Method: Train latent diffusion models on frozen vision backbones to forecast future features, then decode with task-specific readouts. Use distributional metrics for evaluation.

Result: Strong correlation found between perceptual ability and forecasting performance across diverse models and tasks.

Conclusion: Bridging representation learning and generative modeling enhances temporally grounded video understanding.

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.

*Quang-Binh Nguyen,Minh Luu,Quang Nguyen,Anh Tran,Khoi Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSD-VAR is a novel method for content-style decomposition using Visual Autoregressive Modeling, outperforming prior approaches with improved disentanglement and stylization fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage VAR's scale-wise generation for better content-style disentanglement, addressing limitations in existing diffusion-based methods.

Method: Introduces scale-aware optimization, SVD-based rectification, and Augmented K-V memory to enhance separation and identity preservation.

Result: CSD-VAR achieves superior content preservation and stylization fidelity, validated on the new CSD-100 dataset.

Conclusion: CSD-VAR effectively advances content-style decomposition, offering a robust framework for visual synthesis.

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

TL;DR: DreamScene is an end-to-end framework for generating high-quality, editable 3D scenes from text or dialogue, addressing automation, consistency, and control challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene generation from natural language lack automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control, limiting practical applications.

Method: DreamScene uses a GPT-4 agent for scene planning, a graph-based placement algorithm for layout, Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) for geometry, and progressive camera sampling for consistency. It also supports fine-grained editing.

Result: DreamScene outperforms prior methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, enabling open-domain 3D content creation.

Conclusion: DreamScene provides a practical solution for generating and editing 3D scenes from text, advancing the field of 3D content creation.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tunnel lining cracks are critical for safety assessment, but existing methods lack accuracy and efficiency. This study aims to improve both using deep learning.

Method: Proposes a two-step approach: (1) DenseNet-169 for crack image classification, (2) DeepLabV3+ for segmentation, enhanced with visual explanations.

Result: Classification: 92.23% accuracy, 39.80 FPS; Segmentation: 57.01% IoU, 67.44% F1 score, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: The method provides fast, accurate tunnel health assessment and improves interpretability of deep learning models.

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

Motivation: Emotion-driven image editing is valuable for creative industries but challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied visual manifestations.

Method: The approach includes: (1) MoodArchive, a large dataset with hierarchical emotional annotations; (2) MoodifyCLIP, a fine-tuned model to translate emotions into visual attributes; (3) Moodifier, an editing model using MoodifyCLIP and MLLMs for precise emotional edits.

Conclusion: The system bridges abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, unlocking new possibilities for emotional content creation. The dataset, model, and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: QuantEIT introduces a quantum-assisted, ultra-lightweight framework for EIT image reconstruction, reducing model complexity and parameters while improving accuracy and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT's ill-posed inverse problem and inefficiency of deep learning methods with large parameters drive the need for a simpler, scalable solution.

Method: QuantEIT uses a QA-Net with parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits for latent representations and a linear layer for conductivity reconstruction, operating unsupervised.

Result: Outperforms conventional methods with 0.2% of parameters, achieving comparable or superior accuracy and better noise robustness.

Conclusion: QuantEIT is a scalable, efficient, and accurate quantum-assisted solution for EIT image reconstruction, suitable for clinical use.

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

*Qiankun Ma,Ziyao Zhang,Chi Su,Jie Chen,Zhen Song,Hairong Zheng,Wen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba's token reduction is explored, proposing MTR, a training-free framework to reduce computational workload without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiency in Vision Mamba is understudied, and existing ViT token reduction techniques degrade performance due to Mamba's lack of attention mechanisms.

Method: Proposes a Mamba structure-aware importance score and MTR, a plug-and-play token reduction framework.

Result: MTR reduces FLOPs by ~40% on Vim-B with only a 1.6% drop in ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: MTR effectively enhances Vision Mamba's efficiency without retraining, broadening its applicability.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the potential of frozen FMs for CIL in dermatology, addressing the gap in their application for incremental learning in medical domains.

Method: A frozen FM backbone with a lightweight MLP trained incrementally per task, and a zero-training prototype-based variant using nearest mean classifiers.

Result: State-of-the-art performance without forgetting, with the prototype variant also achieving competitive results.

Conclusion: Frozen FMs are highly effective for continual learning in dermatology, supporting their broader use in medical applications.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment and leave semantic-critical concepts vulnerable, necessitating a solution that balances watermarking with multimodal coherence.

Method: VLA-Mark integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics (localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, contextual attention) and an entropy-sensitive mechanism to dynamically balance watermark strength and semantic preservation.

Result: Achieves 7.4% lower PPL, 26.6% higher BLEU, 98.8% AUC detection, and 96.1% attack resilience while maintaining text-visual consistency.

Conclusion: VLA-Mark sets new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking by effectively balancing watermark detectability and semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in anomaly detection due to sensitive human data collection while maintaining detection performance.

Method: Evaluate four anomaly detection methods (MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, PEL4VAD) on anonymized UCF-Crime data using four obfuscation techniques.

Result: Anomaly detection remains viable under anonymization, with some models performing better under specific techniques (e.g., encryption, masking). Algorithm design and learning strategy influence results.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between privacy and detection utility, offering insights for balancing privacy protection with anomaly detection demands.

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: An automated deep learning tool for Cobb angle measurement in scoliosis shows strong agreement with radiologists, suggesting clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual Cobb angle measurement is time-consuming and variable; automation could improve efficiency and consistency.

Method: Retrospective evaluation of AI software on 103 radiographs, compared to two radiologists using Bland-Altman, MAE, RMSE, Pearson correlation, and Cohen kappa.

Result: AI achieved MAE ~3.9Â°, strong correlations (r=0.88-0.91), and moderate kappa (0.51-0.64) for severity grading, matching expert performance.

Conclusion: The AI tool reliably replicates expert measurements, supporting its use in clinical workflows for scoliosis assessment.

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

*Yung-Hong Sun,Ting-Hung Lin,Jiangang Chen,Hongrui Jiang,Yu Hen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C-DOG is a training-free framework for robust multi-view multi-object association, combining graph modeling and epipolar geometry to handle noise and indistinguishable objects without relying on visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations are noisy, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Uses connected delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry, IQR filtering, and 3D back-projection error to associate detections.

Result: Outperforms geometry-based baselines and remains robust under high object density, no visual features, and limited camera overlap.

Conclusion: C-DOG is effective for scalable 3D reconstruction in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Franca is the first fully open-source vision foundation model that outperforms proprietary models like DINOv2 and CLIP. It uses transparent training with public data and introduces innovations in SSL clustering and positional disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-performance, transparent, and open-source vision foundation model that addresses limitations in existing SSL clustering methods and positional biases.

Method: Uses a transparent training pipeline with public datasets (ImageNet-21K, ReLAION-2B), introduces a multi-head clustering projector with Matryoshka representations, and a positional disentanglement strategy.

Result: Franca matches or surpasses proprietary models, improves feature space clarity, and achieves consistent gains on downstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: Franca sets a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models, promoting reproducibility and generalizability in AI.

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

*Kaiyuan Tang,Kuangshi Ai,Jun Han,Chaoli Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: TexGS-VolVis introduces a textured Gaussian splatting framework for volume visualization, enabling high-quality, flexible stylization and real-time rendering by decoupling geometry and appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VolVis methods rely on rigid rules and single-style transfers, limiting flexibility and quality.

Method: TexGS-VolVis uses 2D Gaussian primitives with texture and shading attributes, combined with image/text-driven editing and 2D-lift-3D segmentation.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods in efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility.

Conclusion: TexGS-VolVis advances VolVis by enabling geometry-consistent stylization and fine-grained control, addressing prior limitations.

Abstract: Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce ambiguity in pixel trajectories and ensure consistent character appearance in animations.

Method: Uses explicit structural guidance and a temporal attention mechanism incorporating visual identity from keyframes.

Result: Improved control and consistency in generating transitions.

Conclusion: StructInbet effectively addresses ambiguity and appearance consistency in inbetweening.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose StructInbet, an inbetweening system designed to
generate controllable transitions over explicit structural guidance.
StructInbet introduces two key contributions. First, we propose explicit
structural guidance to the inbetweening problem to reduce the ambiguity
inherent in pixel trajectories. Second, we adopt a temporal attention mechanism
that incorporates visual identity from both the preceding and succeeding
keyframes, ensuring consistency in character appearance.

*Osama Hardan,Omar Elshenhabi,Tamer Khattab,Mohamed Mabrok*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper studies how patch scan order affects MRI segmentation in Vision Mamba models, introducing MS2D for exploring scan paths without extra cost. It finds scan order significantly impacts performance, with contiguous paths like horizontal/vertical rasters outperforming disjointed ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba models' reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D sequences introduces a critical design choice (patch scan order), which is non-trivial in medical imaging due to anatomical priors.

Method: Introduces Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures, and benchmarks 21 scan strategies on three public MRI datasets.

Result: Scan order is statistically significant (Friedman test: ÏÂ²ââ=43.9, p=0.0016), with performance varying by up to 27 Dice points. Contiguous paths (horizontal/vertical rasters) outperform disjointed scans.

Conclusion: Scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter. The paper provides evidence-based optimal paths to maximize Mamba model performance in medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear
computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D
sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan
order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong
anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first
systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce
Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures
that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational
cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public
datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our
analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant
factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance
varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple
horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal
scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and
provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the
performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

TL;DR: A tutorial on domain-randomization in deep learning for neuroimage analysis, using synthetic data to improve model generalization across diverse imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited robustness and generalizability of deep learning models in neuroimage analysis due to narrow training datasets, especially in MRI.

Method: Train deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and anatomical content, derived from segmentation maps.

Result: Models can accurately process unseen image types without retraining, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple imaging modalities.

Conclusion: Synthesis-driven training improves generalization and accessibility of deep learning tools, though it increases computational demands.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key
benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while
discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the
article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to
accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more
accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or
machine learning knowledge.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation algorithm for breast MRI, covers nine anatomical labels and outperforms other models, achieving high Dice scores, especially for heart and liver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation methods for breast MRI are limited in scope, focusing on few structures, reducing their utility for quantitative analysis.

Method: BreastSegNet is developed and benchmarked against nine models (e.g., U-Net, nnU-Net) using a manually annotated dataset of 1123 MRI slices.

Result: nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice score (0.694), excelling in heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone segmentation.

Conclusion: BreastSegNet enhances segmentation accuracy for breast MRI, with plans to release the dataset and model publicly.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer
screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning models synthesize 7T-like MRI from 3T images, improving quality and segmentation without compromising downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI offers superior resolution and contrast but is less accessible. Synthesizing 7T-like images from 3T MRI could bridge this gap.

Method: Two models were trained: a U-Net and a GAN U-Net, using paired 3T and 7T MRI data from 172 participants. Performance was compared to state-of-the-art models.

Result: Synthetic 7T images matched real 7T in detail and surpassed them in visual quality. Automated segmentations from synthetic images were more accurate than from 3T. Downstream task performance was similar to real 3T.

Conclusion: Synthetic 7T images from 3T MRI are feasible, improving quality and segmentation, with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution
and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We
present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T
brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172
participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish
BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:
a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial
network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art
3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.

*Huu-Phu Do,Po-Chih Hu,Hao-Chien Hsueh,Che-Kai Liu,Vu-Hoang Tran,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel strategy for blind super-resolution (BSR) by using HR reference images to create scale-aware degradation kernels, improving SR performance across varying scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BSR methods focus on estimating degradation kernels from LR inputs but overlook the importance of scaling factors, leading to impractical results when applied to different super-resolution scales.

Method: The proposed method uses HR reference images alongside LR inputs to adaptively determine degradation processes, generating additional LR-HR pairs to enhance SR performance.

Result: The approach outperforms previous methods in both trained blind SR models and zero-shot blind SR scenarios.

Conclusion: Considering both degradation kernels and scaling factors with HR references significantly improves blind super-resolution effectiveness.

Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.

TL;DR: A deep learning model using Virchow2 and Efficient-UNet for automated segmentation of melanoma tissue in H&E images, achieving top performance in the PUMA Grand Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of melanoma tissue is labor-intensive and inconsistent, necessitating reliable automated methods.

Method: Combines Virchow2 (a pathology foundation model) with Efficient-UNet for feature extraction and segmentation of five tissue classes.

Result: Won first place in the PUMA Grand Challenge, showing robust performance and generalizability.

Conclusion: Incorporating pathology foundation models like Virchow2 can enhance segmentation accuracy and streamline computational pathology workflows.

Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.

*Hao Fang,Hao Yu,Sihao Teng,Tao Zhang,Siyi Yuan,Huaiwu He,Zhe Liu,Yunjie Yang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: D2IP is a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging, improving speed and accuracy over traditional methods like DIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs and inefficiencies of unsupervised learning methods like DIP in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic imaging.

Method: Introduces UPWS, TPP, and 3D-FastResUNet to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal coherence, and enhance efficiency.

Result: D2IP achieves faster (7.1x) and more accurate reconstructions (24.8% higher MSSIM, 8.1% lower ERR) on tsEIT datasets.

Conclusion: D2IP shows promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging due to its efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),
highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.

### [140] [UGPL: Uncertainty-Guided Progressive Learning for Evidence-Based Classification in Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14102)
*Shravan Venkatraman,Pavan Kumar S,Rakesh Raj Madavan,Chandrakala S*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UGPL is an uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework for CT image classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by focusing on ambiguous regions and refining analysis globally to locally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CT image classification methods struggle with subtle and diverse pathological features, often missing localized abnormalities due to uniform processing.

Method: UGPL uses evidential deep learning to quantify uncertainty, guiding patch extraction via non-maximum suppression for spatial diversity, and employs adaptive fusion for global-to-local refinement.

Result: UGPL improves accuracy by 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% for kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively, over existing methods.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework significantly enhances CT image classification, with the full pipeline proving most effective.

Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive
learning pipeline is implemented. Our code is available at:

*Pablo Marcos-ManchÃ³n,LluÃ­s Fuentemilla*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores whether visual perception is shaped by external stimuli or brain architecture, revealing a convergent representational principle in humans and deep neural networks (DNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if stimulus-driven convergence in perception follows a common trajectory in humans and DNNs, and to identify shared computational solutions.

Method: A unified framework combining inter-subject similarity and model hierarchy alignment, applied to fMRI datasets of visual scene perception.

Result: Identified a cortex-wide network with two pathways (medial-ventral for scene structure, lateral-dorsal for social/biological content), mirrored in DNN hierarchies but not language models.

Conclusion: Convergent computational solutions for visual encoding exist in humans and DNNs, driven by external world structure.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

*Eduardo C. Garrido-MerchÃ¡n,Cristina Puente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a controlled and transparent method to develop expert systems using LLMs, addressing issues like hallucinations by producing symbolic Prolog representations validated by humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate LLM disadvantages (e.g., hallucinations, incorrect facts) and ensure reliable, interpretable expert systems.

Method: Uses domain-limited, prompt-based extraction to generate symbolic Prolog knowledge, validated by experts.

Result: Demonstrates strong fact adherence and semantic coherence in knowledge bases using Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: Proposes a hybrid solution combining LLM recall with symbolic precision for dependable AI in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activity log generation methods lack accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: DailyLLM integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions (location, motion, environment, physiology) using smartphone and smartwatch sensors. It employs a lightweight LLM framework with structured prompting and efficient feature extraction.

Result: DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in BERTScore precision over a 70B-parameter SOTA baseline and offers 10x faster inference speed.

Conclusion: DailyLLM is an efficient and accurate solution for activity log generation, suitable for deployment on personal computers and Raspberry Pi.

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

*Yutao Jin,Haowen Xiao,Jielei Chu,Fengmao Lv,Yuxiao Li,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel visual-language causal intervention framework (ADPC) is proposed for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis, using MRI/fMRI and LLM-generated text to classify CN/MCI/AD cases, outperforming non-causal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early AD diagnosis is challenging due to data biases and complex variable relationships. Existing methods often capture spurious correlations, reducing reliability.

Method: ADPC integrates MRI/fMRI images and LLM-summarized text, applying causal intervention to eliminate confounders like neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers.

Result: ADPC achieves SOTA performance in classifying CN/MCI/AD cases, demonstrating superior reliability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of causal reasoning combined with multi-modal learning for improving neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

TL;DR: G-AI-HMS uses Generative AI to improve human motion simulation by integrating text-to-text and text-to-motion models, outperforming human descriptions in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human motion simulation methods lack fidelity. G-AI-HMS aims to enhance simulation quality for industrial tasks.

Method: Combines Large Language Models and MotionGPT for task-to-motion translation, validated via computer vision and posture estimation.

Result: AI-enhanced motions outperformed human descriptions in most tasks, reducing joint error and temporal misalignment significantly.

Conclusion: G-AI-HMS demonstrates the potential of Generative AI to improve motion simulation fidelity for industrial applications.

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker
behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing
methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

TL;DR: A novel steganography method combining APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection improves security, embedding capacity, and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the 'unused blocks' issue in APVD steganography, which reduces security, capacity, and visual quality.

Method: Integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to mitigate issues.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in security, capacity, and quality metrics like PSNR, UIQ, and SSIM.

Conclusion: The new method is versatile, handling various image types while ensuring secure and high-quality data transmission.

Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly
within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive
Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,
encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can
cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to
lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy
that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate
these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing
techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation
of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with
pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics
such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),
and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods
in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a
variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby
ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of
the image.

TL;DR: GIFT is a gradient-aware immunization technique to defend diffusion models against malicious fine-tuning while preserving safe content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under adversarial fine-tuning.

Method: GIFT frames immunization as a bi-level optimization problem: upper-level degrades harmful concept representation, while lower-level preserves safe data performance.

Result: GIFT robustly resists malicious fine-tuning while maintaining safe generative quality.

Conclusion: GIFT offers a promising direction for creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend
diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their
ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety
checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under
adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a
bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's
ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and
maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe
data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while
maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method
significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while
maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for
creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial
fine-tuning attacks.

TL;DR: Bio-inspired neural networks with mixed learning rules, discovered via NAS, achieve higher accuracy and scalability, even surpassing BP-based models in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bio-inspired networks lag behind BP-based models in accuracy and scalability despite advantages like robustness and energy efficiency.

Method: Enlarge NAS search space to include bio-inspired learning rules, allowing different rules per layer.

Result: Mixed learning rules improve accuracy (e.g., 95.16% on CIFAR-10) and scalability, sometimes surpassing BP-based models.

Conclusion: Layer-wise diversity in learning rules enhances performance, motivating further research on mixed bio-inspired rules.

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in theoretical understanding of why the transformer architecture works, prompting a physical perspective to explain its success.

Method: The authors construct physical models in Fock space over the Hilbert space of tokens, treating large language models as open quantum systems.

Result: The physical models provide a theoretical foundation for the transformer architecture in large language models.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap in understanding the transformer's success by grounding it in physical principles.

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture

Result: VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Video foundation models with masked action prediction can enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable

Motivation: Current T2I models misalign with diverse human experiences, necessitating pluralistic alignment to understand and steer towards conflicting human values.

Method: Introduces the DIVE dataset for pluralistic alignment, uses intersectional human raters for feedback, and analyzes demographic differences in harm perception.

Result: Demographics are crucial for diverse viewpoints, revealing context-dependent harm perceptions differing from conventional evaluations.

Conclusion: Provides foundational tools for equitable T2I systems, emphasizing efficient data collection, LLM judgments, and model steerability.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of generalizability in existing HAR methods for IMU data, especially in diverse environments or populations like Parkinson's patients.

Method: Proposes a cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach using large-scale unlabeled IMU-video data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art IMU-video and IMU-only pretraining in zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on OOD datasets.

Conclusion: Cross-modal pretraining is effective for learning generalizable representations in dynamic data like IMU signals, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

TL;DR: DyG-RAG introduces a dynamic graph retrieval-augmented generation framework for temporal reasoning, addressing limitations in existing methods by modeling evolving event structures and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph RAG methods lack temporal reasoning capabilities, struggling with evolving event structures and temporal order, which DyG-RAG aims to resolve.

Method: DyG-RAG uses Dynamic Event Units (DEUs) for time-aware retrieval, constructs event graphs for multi-hop reasoning, and employs a Time Chain-of-Thought strategy for grounded generation.

Result: DyG-RAG significantly improves accuracy and recall on temporal QA benchmarks, outperforming standard RAG systems.

Conclusion: DyG-RAG advances temporal-aware generation, enabling faithful reasoning over time-sensitive queries and setting a foundation for future work in dynamic knowledge grounding.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

*Shad Nygren,Pinar Avci,Andre Daniels,Reza Rassol,Afshin Beheshti,Diego Galeano*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG architectures to enhance LLMs for accurate drug side effect detection, achieving near-perfect accuracy with GraphRAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug side effects are a major health concern, but LLMs lack reliability due to limitations like black-box training and hallucinations.

Method: Integration of drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B model using RAG and GraphRAG architectures.

Result: GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in retrieving drug side effects from 19,520 associations.

Conclusion: The framework advances LLM use in pharmacovigilance, offering a scalable and accurate solution.

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced
methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations,
including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to
hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability
in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose
two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which
integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language
model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations
(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that
GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This
framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a
significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance
applications.

### [155] [SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs: Measuring the Impact of Training Data Memorization and Knowledge Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13859)
*Aleksandr Gashkov,Aleksandr Perevalov,Maria Eltsova,Andreas Both*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to evaluate LLMs' quality in generating SPARQL queries for QA systems, testing zero-shot, knowledge injection, and anonymized knowledge injection scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' influence on QA quality and determine if good results stem from training data memorization.

Method: Evaluates LLMs under three conditions: zero-shot SPARQL generation, knowledge injection, and anonymized knowledge injection.

Result: Provides insights into LLMs' actual capabilities and portability, independent of training data biases.

Conclusion: The method is portable, robust, and applicable to any KGQA system or LLM, ensuring consistent evaluation of LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces
cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,
generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named
Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the
central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the
rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method
to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is
still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and
trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have
no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already
included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that
evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a
natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL
generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge
injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of
the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will
help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly
be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.
LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any
knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,
s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is
possible.

### [156] [Preprint: Did I Just Browse A Website Written by LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13933)
*Sichang "Steven" He,Ramesh Govindan,Harsha V. Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable pipeline to detect LLM-dominant web content, achieving 100% accuracy in tests, and highlights its growing prevalence in search results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of unreliable and unethical LLM-dominant content on the web, which is hard for humans to distinguish, necessitates reliable detection methods.

Method: A pipeline classifying entire websites by analyzing multiple prose-like pages with an LLM text detector, trained on 120 ground truth sites.

Result: 100% accuracy in tests; detection of LLM-dominant sites in search engine results and Common Crawl archives, showing their growing prevalence.

Conclusion: LLM-dominant content is increasingly common and ranks highly in search results, raising concerns about its impact on users and the web ecosystem.

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models
(LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs
plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and
unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers
struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for
LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient,
because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content
has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire
websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we
classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple
prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct
ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing
across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant
among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We
find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search
results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web
ecosystem.

### [157] [Multiresolution local smoothness detection in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13480)
*Sara Avesani,Gianluca Giacchi,Michael Multerer*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A linear-time algorithm detects local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals using samplet coefficients, outperforming traditional wavelets for higher-dimensional and scattered data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals, especially in higher dimensions and scattered data, where traditional wavelets fall short.

Method: Utilizes the fast samplet transform, a distributional wavelet transform for scattered data, linking samplet coefficient decay to pointwise regularity.

Result: The method effectively quantifies regularity, with numerical studies confirming its robustness in one-, two-, and three-dimensional signals.

Conclusion: Samplets provide a powerful tool for regularity detection in diverse applications, outperforming traditional wavelets for complex data structures.

Abstract: Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet
coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the
local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach
quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CHEFS database, a unified dataset consolidating EFSA food safety monitoring data, enabling AI-driven analysis of trends and hazards in European food safety from 2000 to 2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distributed and large-scale nature of EFSA monitoring data (392M results across 1000+ files) hinders accessibility and analysis, necessitating a centralized solution.

Method: Creation of the CHEFS database, which consolidates EFSA data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal products, and chemical contaminants into a structured dataset.

Result: Demonstrates CHEFS' utility by analyzing trends in monitoring activities, non-compliant products, and contaminants across Europe.

Conclusion: CHEFS serves as a centralized, strategic tool for food safety policy, research, and regulation.

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by
member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and
published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived
from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food
products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze
trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the
current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling
several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this,
we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which
consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal
product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured
dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and
demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety
monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring
activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often
non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences
across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a
centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy,
research, and regulation.

### [159] [Leveraging the Spatial Hierarchy: Coarse-to-fine Trajectory Generation via Cascaded Hybrid Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13366)
*Baoshen Guo,Zhiqing Hong,Junyi Li,Shenhao Wang,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Cardiff is a cascaded hybrid diffusion-based framework for synthesizing fine-grained, privacy-preserving urban mobility trajectories by decomposing the process into discrete road segment-level and continuous GPS-level generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban mobility data is crucial for smart-city applications but is hard to obtain due to privacy and cost issues. Existing methods fail to handle structural complexity and high-dimensional distributions.

Method: Cardiff uses a two-level approach: (1) diffusion transformer-based latent denoising for segment-level synthesis, and (2) GPS-level conditional denoising with noise augmentation for fine-grained generation.

Result: Cardiff outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world datasets, balancing privacy and utility effectively.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generates realistic, high-fidelity trajectories while addressing privacy concerns, offering a scalable solution for urban mobility data synthesis.

Abstract: Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and
plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to
privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human
mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large
scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing.
However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of
trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and
generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose
Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory
synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility
generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff
decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road
segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,
to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first
encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and
design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level
trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,
we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a
noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.
Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates
high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables
a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental
results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EVLA enhances VLA models for robotics by improving inference speed and memory efficiency on edge devices, using non-autoregressive prediction and SLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying large-scale VLMs on resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems.

Method: Introduces Edge VLA (EVLA) with two innovations: eliminating autoregressive prediction for speedup and leveraging SLMs for efficiency.

Result: EVLA achieves comparable training to OpenVLA with 7x faster inference and reduced computational demands.

Conclusion: EVLA enables real-time VLA performance on edge devices, with released code and checkpoints for further research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while
enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

research.

*Mehul Anand,Shishir Kolathaya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A semi-supervised framework using latent space control barrier certificates (CBCs) and vision transformers for safe visuomotor policy synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoiding extensive supervised labeling of safety-critical data in real-world settings by leveraging world models and latent space predictions.

Method: Jointly learns a neural barrier function and safe controller with limited labeled data, utilizing vision transformers for latent dynamics modeling.

Result: Enables scalable and data-efficient safe control from visual data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for synthesizing safe controllers without heavy reliance on labeled data.

Abstract: Synthesising safe controllers from visual data typically requires extensive
supervised labelling of safety-critical data, which is often impractical in
real-world settings. Recent advances in world models enable reliable prediction
in latent spaces, opening new avenues for scalable and data-efficient safe
control. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised framework that leverages
control barrier certificates (CBCs) learned in the latent space of a world
model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a
neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data,
while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent
dynamics modelling.
