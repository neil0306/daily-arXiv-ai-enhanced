TL;DR: SAE-based method automatically identifies model weaknesses and benchmark coverage gaps by analyzing concept activations in LLM representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized LLM benchmarks provide aggregated metrics but obscure specific model weaknesses (model gaps) and imbalanced benchmark coverage (benchmark gaps). Need automated, unsupervised method to uncover these gaps without manual supervision.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract concept activations from LLM internal representations. Computes saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data to ground evaluation in model's representations and enable cross-benchmark comparison.

Result: Applied to 2 open-source models and 10 benchmarks. Found models consistently underperform on concepts contrasting sycophantic behaviors (politely refusing requests, asserting boundaries) and safety-related concepts. Benchmarks over-represent obedience/authority concepts while missing core concepts within intended scope.

Conclusion: Method provides representation-grounded evaluation enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Complements conventional aggregated metrics by revealing why models scored as they did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect intended scope.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

*Alexandros Christoforos,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SA-DiffuSeq introduces sparse attention into diffusion models for long-form text generation, reducing computational cost while maintaining quality through soft absorbing states and improved sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion approaches for long-form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases, limiting their scalability for long document modeling.

Method: SA-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention into the diffusion framework, selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process. It includes a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics to stabilize diffusion trajectories and accelerate sequence reconstruction.

Result: SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. It demonstrates improved precision in long-range dependency modeling.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation, making SA-DiffuSeq well-suited for demanding applications like scientific writing, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue.

Abstract: Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.

### [3] [TokSuite: Measuring the Impact of Tokenizer Choice on Language Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20757)
*Gül Sena Altıntaş,Malikeh Ehghaghi,Brian Lester,Fengyuan Liu,Wanru Zhao,Marco Ciccone,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokSuite is a framework for isolating and studying tokenizer effects on language models by training identical models with different tokenizers and providing a benchmark for tokenization-sensitive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization is fundamental to language models but its specific impact on performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the difficulty of isolating tokenization effects from other model components.

Method: Created TokSuite with 14 models using different tokenizers but identical architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Also developed a benchmark measuring performance on real-world perturbations affecting tokenization.

Result: TokSuite enables robust decoupling of tokenizer influence, supporting novel findings about benefits and shortcomings of various popular tokenizers.

Conclusion: TokSuite provides a systematic framework for studying tokenization's role in language models, revealing previously unclear impacts of different tokenizers on model performance.

Abstract: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

*Ziyi Zhu,Olivier Tieleman,Caitlin A. Stamatis,Luka Smyth,Thomas D. Hull,Daniel R. Cahn,Matteo Malgaroli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adversarial training framework improves user simulator realism for mental health chatbots, enhancing failure mode detection and system evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems, but creating accurate simulators that can expose system failure modes remains challenging.

Method: Adversarial training framework with competitive dynamic between generator (user simulator) and discriminator, iteratively improving simulator realism through adversarial iterations.

Result: Fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues. Adversarial training enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. Achieves strong correlation between simulated and real failure rates while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

Abstract: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, yet creating simulators that accurately replicate human behavior remains challenging. A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

### [5] [Large Language Models Approach Expert Pedagogical Quality in Math Tutoring but Differ in Instructional and Linguistic Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20780)
*Ramatu Oiza Abdulsalam,Segun Aroyehun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs approach expert-level pedagogical quality in math tutoring but differ in instructional strategies - they underuse expert techniques like restating/revoicing while being more verbose, polite, and lexically diverse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how closely LLM-generated tutoring responses align with expert human practice in mathematics instruction, examining both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics.

Method: Controlled turn-level comparison with expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple LLMs responding to the same math remediation conversation turns. Analysis of instructional strategies (restating/revoicing, pressing for accuracy) and linguistic characteristics (lexical diversity, readability, politeness, agency).

Result: LLMs approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality but differ systematically: they underuse restating/revoicing strategies, produce longer/more lexically diverse/polite responses. Restating/revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy positively correlate with pedagogical quality, while agentic/polite language negatively correlates.

Conclusion: Recent LLMs achieve comparable pedagogical quality to expert human tutors but rely on different instructional/linguistic strategies, highlighting the importance of analyzing both dimensions when evaluating tutoring systems.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.

### [6] [Investigating Model Editing for Unlearning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20794)
*Shariqah Hossain,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, WISE) adapted for unlearning can outperform baseline unlearning methods in forgetting quality, but struggle with precise scope definition and preserving overall model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning methods are inefficient for large language models and often fail to fully remove information without degrading retained knowledge. Model editing algorithms address similar problems but focus on redirecting information rather than removal.

Method: The authors explore model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, WISE) and design new editing targets specifically for an unlearning setting, adapting these editing approaches to the task of information removal rather than redirection.

Result: Model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of forgetting quality depending on the setting. However, like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to precisely define what should be unlearned without damaging overall model performance.

Conclusion: Model editing algorithms show promise for machine unlearning tasks and can outperform traditional unlearning methods, but challenges remain in precisely defining unlearning scope and maintaining overall model performance during the forgetting process.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.

### [7] [Measuring Mechanistic Independence: Can Bias Be Removed Without Erasing Demographics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20796)
*Zhengyang Shan,Aaron Mueller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether demographic bias mechanisms in language models are separable from general demographic recognition, finding that targeted feature ablations can reduce bias while preserving recognition capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if demographic bias in language models stems from the same mechanisms as general demographic recognition, and whether models can be debiased without losing their ability to detect demographic information.

Method: Multi-task evaluation setup associating demographics with names, professions, and education levels; comparison of attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features; targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B model.

Result: Attribution-based ablations reduce race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy; correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias; removing attribution features in education tasks causes "prior collapse" and increases bias.

Conclusion: Demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and mechanistic inference-time interventions enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate how independent demographic bias mechanisms are from general demographic recognition in language models. Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

### [8] [Semantic Deception: When Reasoning Models Can't Compute an Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20812)
*Nathaniël de Leeuw,Marceau Nahon,Mathis Reymond,Raja Chatila,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with symbolic abstraction when symbols carry misleading semantic associations, showing they over-rely on surface-level semantics rather than true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs possess genuine reasoning capabilities or merely exploit learned semantic associations, especially in contexts where human values are at stake and robust symbolic reasoning is essential.

Method: Introduce semantic deceptions using novel symbols that replace standard digits and mathematical operators, then test LLMs' ability to solve simple calculations in this altered notation while resisting misleading semantic cues.

Result: Semantic cues significantly deteriorate LLMs' performance on simple tasks, revealing limitations in symbolic manipulation abilities and a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, with chain-of-thought potentially amplifying statistical correlations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations in symbolic reasoning, raising ethical concerns about attributing reasoning abilities to them, particularly in decision-making contexts where robust abstraction is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.

### [9] [EssayCBM: Rubric-Aligned Concept Bottleneck Models for Transparent Essay Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20817)
*Kumar Satvik Chaudhary,Chengshuai Zhao,Fan Zhang,Yung Hin Tse,Garima Agrawal,Yuli Deng,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EssayCBM is a rubric-aligned framework for interpretable essay grading that evaluates eight writing concepts instead of directly predicting grades, providing transparent, adjustable scoring with human-in-the-loop capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated essay grading systems using large language models are black boxes, making it difficult for educators and students to understand how essays are evaluated. There's a need for interpretable assessment systems that provide transparent feedback.

Method: EssayCBM uses dedicated prediction heads on an encoder to evaluate eight specific writing concepts (Thesis Clarity, Evidence Use, etc.). These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only these concepts. The system allows instructors to adjust concept predictions and instantly see updated grades.

Result: EssayCBM matches the performance of black-box grading systems while providing actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface. It enables accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation.

Conclusion: EssayCBM successfully addresses the interpretability challenge in automated essay grading by providing a transparent, rubric-aligned framework that maintains performance while offering meaningful feedback and human oversight capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding how automated grading systems evaluate essays remains a significant challenge for educators and students, especially when large language models function as black boxes. We introduce EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that prioritizes interpretability in essay assessment. Instead of predicting grades directly from text, EssayCBM evaluates eight writing concepts, such as Thesis Clarity and Evidence Use, through dedicated prediction heads on an encoder. These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only concepts. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly view the updated grade, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation. EssayCBM matches black-box performance while offering actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.

*Zhan Qu,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MediEval benchmark links EHRs to knowledge base for evaluating LLMs in medicine, revealing critical failure modes like hallucinated support and truth inversion. CoRFu fine-tuning method improves safety and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in medicine but face reliability and safety concerns. Existing evaluations either test factual knowledge in isolation or assess patient reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap in comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Introduces MediEval benchmark linking MIMIC-IV EHRs to unified knowledge base (UMLS/biomedical vocabularies) to generate diverse factual/counterfactual statements. Uses 4-quadrant framework considering knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Proposes Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions.

Result: Identifies critical failure modes (hallucinated support, truth inversion) in current LLMs. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

Conclusion: MediEval provides systematic evaluation framework for medical LLMs, revealing safety-critical failure modes. CoRFu fine-tuning effectively addresses these risks, improving both accuracy and safety for medical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

### [12] [How important is Recall for Measuring Retrieval Quality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20854)
*Shelly Schwartz,Oleg Vasilyev,Randy Sawaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper evaluates retrieval strategies when total relevant documents are unknown, introduces new metric that doesn't require knowing total relevant docs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world retrieval with large, evolving knowledge bases, the total number of relevant documents is typically unknown, making recall impossible to compute. Need practical evaluation methods for retrieval quality in realistic settings.

Method: Evaluates established retrieval strategies by measuring correlation between retrieval metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality (responses generated from retrieved docs). Experiments across multiple datasets with 2-15 relevant docs. Introduces new retrieval quality measure that doesn't require knowing total relevant docs.

Result: The paper presents experimental results showing how different retrieval metrics correlate with LLM-based quality judgments. The newly introduced simple retrieval quality measure performs well without requiring knowledge of total relevant documents.

Conclusion: Proposes practical evaluation approach for realistic retrieval settings where recall can't be computed, and introduces effective retrieval quality measure that works without knowing total relevant documents.

Abstract: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

Abstract: We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.

TL;DR: Systematic study of small language models under compute constraints shows attention-based models outperform MLPs in efficiency, but large-model techniques like RoPE don't always transfer to small-scale regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices and training budgets interact for small language models under strict compute constraints, examining what works at small scale versus large scale.

Method: Progressive architectural scaling from linear predictors to transformers, evaluating on Tiny Shakespeare (char-level) and PTB/WikiText-2 (word-level). Metrics: test NLL, parameters, training FLOPs.

Result: Attention models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale. Increasing depth/context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. RoPE doesn't necessarily transfer to small models.

Conclusion: Small language models require different design principles than large ones; attention remains efficient at small scale, but techniques successful in large models may not work for small-scale regimes.

Abstract: We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to trace the provenance of reasoning in distilled models, showing they can generate teacher-originated actions in novel contexts, and introduces a teacher-guided data selection method based on divergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous reasoning distillation approaches lack analysis of where distilled models' capabilities come from, and it's unclear if they maintain teacher-like behavior in novel contexts or regress to original patterns, raising concerns about generalization.

Method: Introduces cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework: for each action from distilled model, compares predictive probabilities from teacher, original student, and distilled model to classify actions into categories and trace their provenance.

Result: Demonstrates distilled models can generate teacher-originated actions in test-time contexts, which correlate with and explain observed performance. Teacher-guided data selection method based on divergence analysis proves effective across multiple teacher-student combinations.

Conclusion: The provenance-tracing framework provides valuable insights into reasoning distillation, showing distilled models can maintain teacher-like behavior in novel contexts, and offers a principled approach to data selection for improved distillation.

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.

TL;DR: FEND is a multi-modal framework using speech and text to detect Alzheimer's, depression, and autism across languages, showing strong results for AD/depression but challenges with ASD and modality imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuropsychiatric disorders have linguistic/acoustic abnormalities that could serve as biomarkers, but current approaches lack multi-lingual generalization and unified evaluation frameworks.

Method: Proposed FEND framework integrates speech and text modalities, evaluated on 13 multi-lingual datasets across English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, with systematic multi-modal fusion analysis.

Result: Multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. Modality imbalance is common, and cross-corpus experiments show robust performance in consistent scenarios but degradation in multi-lingual/task-heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: FEND advances automated, lifespan-inclusive, multi-lingual neuropsychiatric assessment by providing extensive benchmarks and performance analysis, encouraging adoption for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

*Shize Liang,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLP probes for token-level hallucination detection in LLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods by using nonlinear modeling of hidden states with Bayesian optimization for optimal layer placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate hallucinated content that limits high-risk applications. Current detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and knowledge retrieval have limitations: they produce errors at high confidence levels and depend on retrieval efficiency/coverage. Probe methods using hidden states offer real-time, lightweight advantages but traditional linear probes fail to capture nonlinear semantic structures.

Method: Propose neural network framework for token-level hallucination detection. Freeze LLM parameters and use lightweight MLP probes for nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. Design multi-objective joint loss function for detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Establish layer position-probe performance response model using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers.

Result: Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA show MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed MLP probe framework effectively addresses hallucination detection limitations by combining nonlinear modeling of hidden states with automated layer optimization, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Protein/RNA language models can't use Chain-of-Thought reasoning due to limited token expressiveness, so researchers developed reflection pretraining with "thinking tokens" to enable intermediate reasoning, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting works well for natural language models but can't be applied to protein/RNA language models because their token spaces (amino acids) lack the expressiveness needed for intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: Introduced reflection pretraining for biological sequence models, enabling generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. This augments the token set to enhance biological language expressiveness and reasoning capacity.

Result: Theoretically demonstrated that augmented token set enhances biological language expressiveness. Experimentally showed that reflection pretraining teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains over standard pretraining.

Conclusion: Limited expressiveness of protein language restricts CoT-style reasoning, but reflection pretraining with thinking tokens overcomes this limitation, enabling intermediate reasoning and improving model performance in biological domains.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.

TL;DR: MedMistake is an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes from LLM patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs to evaluate clinical reasoning in frontier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations in clinical settings use multi-dimensional rubrics, but replicating specific mistakes across different LLM models requires manual effort. There's a need for an automated way to identify and benchmark clinical reasoning failures.

Method: The pipeline: (1) creates complex conversational data between LLM patients and doctors, (2) evaluates with a committee of 2 LLM judges across multiple dimensions, (3) converts mistakes into simplified single-shot QA scenarios. The resulting MedMistake-All dataset contains 3,390 QA pairs where current models fail.

Result: Created MedMistake-Bench (211 expert-validated questions) and evaluated 12 frontier LLMs. GPT models, Claude, and Grok performed best on the benchmark. The full dataset of 3,390 QA pairs (MedMistake-All) is publicly available.

Conclusion: MedMistake provides an automated pipeline for extracting and benchmarking clinical reasoning mistakes in LLMs, offering a valuable resource for evaluating and improving medical AI systems through identified failure cases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selective knowledge distillation focusing only on CoT tokens can achieve ~94% of full-sequence performance with 50% computational savings by training on just the first half of reasoning sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning distillation from LLMs to smaller models requires training on lengthy sequences (prompt, chain-of-thought, answer), making it computationally expensive. The authors want to understand how supervision allocation across different sequence segments affects efficiency and performance.

Method: Analyze how supervision allocation across prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments affects student performance. Establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. Focus on selective knowledge distillation over only CoT tokens when prompt and answer information is encompassed by them.

Result: Training on only the first 50% of tokens in every training sequence retains ~94% of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about 50% each. Selective distillation over CoT tokens is effective when prompt and answer information is encompassed within them.

Conclusion: Reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens, providing a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs. This suggests that not all tokens in reasoning sequences are equally important for effective knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

*Xiaofeng Shi,Qian Kou,Yuduo Li,Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SFTKey is a two-stage fine-tuning method that addresses attention imbalance in LLMs by first training on full CoT sequences for format, then focusing only on answer tokens for accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SFT causes LLMs to allocate disproportionate attention to long CoT sequences, reducing focus on the shorter but essential final answer portion, which directly determines task success and evaluation quality.

Method: A two-stage training scheme: Stage 1 uses conventional SFT to ensure proper output format; Stage 2 fine-tunes only the Key portion (final answer) to improve accuracy while preserving format generation ability.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families show SFTKey achieves average accuracy improvement exceeding 5% over conventional SFT while maintaining correct format generation.

Conclusion: SFTKey advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens, addressing attention imbalance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAS framework adapts node semantics using LLM-GNN feedback loop to handle structure-semantics heterogeneity in graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph data has varying predictive signal sources (node semantics vs. structural patterns), but existing model-centric approaches with fixed inductive biases cannot generalize across diverse graph domains.

Method: Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement (DAS) couples a fixed GNN with an LLM in closed feedback loop: GNN provides supervisory signals to guide LLM's semantic refinement, refined semantics update the graph learner.

Result: Consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs across both text-rich and text-free graphs.

Conclusion: Data-centric semantic adaptation effectively addresses structure-semantics heterogeneity, demonstrating advantages over model-centric approaches.

Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

*Eduard Stefan Dinuta,Iustin Sirbu,Traian Rebedea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semi-supervised learning with task-specific augmentations improves safety classification for LLMs without requiring large labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety classifiers for LLMs require large labeled datasets that are difficult to acquire, prone to errors, and often rely on synthetic data. There's a need for more efficient approaches to improve LLM safety.

Method: Proposes using semi-supervised learning techniques that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data. Emphasizes task-specific augmentations rather than general-purpose ones to improve safety classification performance.

Result: Semi-supervised learning improves performance on safety tasks for both LLM prompts and responses. Task-specific augmentations significantly outperform general-purpose augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning with task-specific augmentations offers an effective alternative to traditional supervised approaches for LLM safety classification, addressing data acquisition challenges while improving performance.

Abstract: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

*Sichun Luo,Yi Huang,Mukai Li,Shichang Meng,Fengyuan Liu,Zefa Hu,Junlan Feng,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClarifyMT-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' clarification abilities in multi-turn dialogues with ambiguous user inputs, featuring diverse simulated user personas and showing that current LLMs have an under-clarification bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM clarification benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions or cooperative users, failing to capture realistic multi-turn scenarios where users provide incomplete or ambiguous information in conversational settings.

Method: Created ClarifyMT-Bench using a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues based on a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Evaluated ten representative LLMs and proposed ClarifyAgent, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning components.

Result: LLMs show a consistent under-clarification bias - they tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. ClarifyAgent substantially improves robustness across ambiguity conditions.

Conclusion: ClarifyMT-Bench provides a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask versus answer questions and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpidR-Adapt enables rapid adaptation to new languages with minimal unlabeled data using meta-learning, achieving 100x more data-efficient learning than standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human infants learn language efficiently with minimal exposure, while current self-supervised speech models require massive data. This paper aims to bridge this efficiency gap by developing methods for rapid adaptation to new languages with minimal data.

Method: 1) Cast low-resource speech representation learning as meta-learning problem; 2) Create multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol with bi-level optimization; 3) Propose first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO) for scalable meta-training; 4) Stabilize training with robust initialization using interleaved self-supervised and supervised objectives.

Result: SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), outperforming in-domain language models after training on less than 1 hour of target-language audio, making it over 100x more data-efficient than standard training.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient speech representations, bridging the gap between human language acquisition efficiency and current AI models.

Abstract: Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt.

### [27] [SMART SLM: Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer, A Small Language Model for Accurate Document Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21280)
*Divij Dudeja,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMART is a structured memory transformer that improves engineering manual comprehension by using hierarchical fact extraction, indexed memory, and fusion, achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters than GPT-2 and BERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering manuals are difficult to read due to length, dense format, and complex content. Standard transformers treat them as flat token streams, leading to incorrect numeric answers and inefficient fact memorization.

Method: SMART uses three components: 1) Grammarian Tree LSTM for syntax-aware fact extraction (subject-relation-object), 2) Compact indexed MANN memory storing facts as 384D vectors with source tracking, 3) 6-layer Transformer for fusing retrieved facts into responses.

Result: SMART uses only 45.51M parameters (64% less than GPT-2, 69% less than BERT) and achieves 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2. It supports dual inference modes: fast path for known documents (sub-second) and dynamic path with RAG for new uploads.

Conclusion: SMART provides a practical solution for engineering manual comprehension with better accuracy, fewer parameters, and reduced hallucinations compared to standard small transformer models, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PTP enables parallel token prediction in language models by incorporating sampling into the model, reducing autoregressive latency while maintaining modeling power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding in language models while avoiding restrictive independence assumptions of existing multi-token prediction methods.

Method: Parallel Token Prediction (PTP) framework that jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating sampling procedure into the model. Can be trained via distillation or inverse autoregressive training without a teacher.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B, accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. Proves PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions.

Conclusion: Parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power, as demonstrated by the universal PTP framework.

Abstract: We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

### [29] [Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21329)
*Xinhe Wang,Jin Huang,Xingjian Zhang,Tianhao Wang,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC-style reasoning benchmarks primarily test visual perception rather than inductive reasoning; perception errors account for ~80% of model failures, suggesting current evaluations overstate reasoning deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the common interpretation that poor performance on ARC-style benchmarks reflects deficiencies in machine reasoning. The authors hypothesize that the performance gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than shortcomings in inductive reasoning.

Method: Introduces a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning: (1) perception stage converts each image independently into natural-language descriptions, (2) reasoning stage induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This prevents cross-image inductive signal leakage and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Evaluated across three ARC-style datasets: Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO.

Result: Across all three datasets, perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap. Manual inspection of reasoning traces reveals approximately 80% of model failures stem from perception errors. The two-stage pipeline demonstrates that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges.

Conclusion: ARC-style benchmarks conflate perception and reasoning challenges, and observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. There is a need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.

Abstract: Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.
  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.

*Ziyu Chen,Xinbei Jiang,Peng Sun,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDMs suffer from output quality sensitivity to decoding order; the paper introduces Denoising Entropy to measure cumulative predictive uncertainty and proposes entropy-guided algorithms that significantly improve generation quality on reasoning, planning, and code tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Diffusion Models offer flexible non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom creates a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. The authors identify that variability in output quality stems from cumulative predictive uncertainty along generative paths.

Method: The paper formalizes the decoding order problem and introduces Denoising Entropy as a computable metric to quantify cumulative predictive uncertainty. They propose two entropy-guided algorithms: 1) a post-hoc selection method that chooses the best output from multiple decoding paths, and 2) a real-time guidance strategy that optimizes the decoding path during generation.

Result: Experiments show that entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. The methods effectively turn uncertainty from a liability into an advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.

Conclusion: The work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation in Masked Diffusion Models, demonstrating that uncertainty can be leveraged as a key advantage rather than a limitation for discovering high-quality solutions.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.

TL;DR: VL4Gaze is the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating and training vision-language models on gaze understanding, showing that current VLMs struggle with gaze interpretation without targeted supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze provides crucial cues for understanding attention, intention, and social interaction, but current vision-language models lack systematic evaluation or training for gaze understanding, leaving it unclear if this capability emerges from general-purpose pre-training.

Method: Created VL4Gaze benchmark with 489K question-answer pairs across 124K images, formulating gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four tasks: gaze object description, gaze direction description, gaze point location, and ambiguous question recognition.

Result: Large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. Training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted multi-task supervision is essential for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. The dataset and code will be released to support further research in this direction.

Abstract: Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.

Motivation: There's a need for efficient trash detection systems that can run on resource-constrained edge and IoT devices (TinyML constraints) for environmental monitoring and waste management applications.

Method: Uses an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework with Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet, evolutionary search alternating between backbone and neck/head optimization, population passthrough mechanism, and accuracy predictor.

Result: TrashDet-l achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors. On MAX78002 microcontroller, specialized variants reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53%.

Conclusion: The proposed hardware-aware NAS framework successfully generates scalable, deployment-ready trash detectors (TrashDets) that significantly outperform existing TinyML detectors in accuracy, efficiency, and resource utilization for edge/IoT applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

Motivation: SSC is crucial for 3D perception in robotics but has been unexplored in aerial scenarios. LiDAR sensors are problematic for UAVs due to regulations, weight constraints, and sparse point clouds from elevated viewpoints. Need for camera-based SSC benchmark for aerial applications.

Method: Introduced OccuFly benchmark captured at 50m, 40m, 30m altitudes across four seasons. Proposed LiDAR-free data generation framework using camera modality with traditional 3D reconstruction. Automated label transfer by lifting annotated 2D masks into reconstructed point clouds to minimize manual 3D annotation.

Result: Created first real-world camera-based aerial SSC benchmark covering urban, industrial, rural scenarios with 22 semantic classes. Data format follows established conventions for integration with existing research. Benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and identified challenges specific to elevated viewpoints.

Conclusion: OccuFly provides comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding, enabling SSC research in aerial domains using ubiquitous camera sensors on modern UAVs while addressing LiDAR limitations.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.

TL;DR: NullBUS is a multimodal mixed-supervision framework for breast ultrasound segmentation that handles both prompt-available and prompt-unavailable scenarios using nullable prompts and learnable null embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness of promptable segmentation methods that require text or spatial prompts.

Method: Proposes NullBUS framework with nullable prompts implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent while still using text when available.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean IoU of 0.8568 and mean Dice of 0.9103 on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets under mixed prompt availability.

Conclusion: NullBUS effectively addresses the challenge of missing metadata in BUS datasets by enabling robust segmentation performance in both prompt-available and prompt-unavailable scenarios through its mixed-supervision framework.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

TL;DR: End-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline co-designing optics, sensors, and neural networks for autonomous driving perception, achieving better segmentation with compact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines separate camera design from perception, using fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs optimized for human viewing rather than machine perception. This discards information during processing and forces models to adapt to sensor artifacts.

Method: Task-driven co-design framework unifying optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives.

Result: Consistent mIoU improvements on KITTI-360 over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Achieved with compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth.

Conclusion: Full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks establishes a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAMMI-75 is a diverse, open-access dataset of 75 multi-channel microscopy studies enabling development of channel-adaptive cellular morphology models that work across different imaging types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cellular morphology models are specialized for single microscopy types, limiting reuse across studies due to technical mismatches (different channels) or out-of-distribution conditions.

Method: Created CHAMMI-75 dataset by curating heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies from publicly available sources to train channel-adaptive models.

Result: Training with CHAMMI-75 improves performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks due to its high diversity in microscopy modalities.

Conclusion: This work enables next-generation cellular morphology models that are adaptable to various microscopy image types for broader biological applications.

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

TL;DR: Adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content to reduce visual redundancy, integrated with FastVLM without architecture changes or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face high inference latency and computational costs, especially with high-resolution inputs. Existing pipelines use static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs.

Method: Proposes adaptive visual preprocessing combining content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy before vision encoding. Integrated with FastVLM without modifying architecture or requiring retraining.

Result: On DocVQA subset: reduces per-image inference time by over 50%, lowers mean full generation time, achieves consistent reduction of more than 55% in visual token count compared to baseline pipeline.

Conclusion: Input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models, demonstrating significant computational savings without model modifications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.

Method: ALIVE operates fully on local hardware with three components: (1) Avatar-delivered lectures using ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) Content-aware retrieval combining semantic similarity with timestamp alignment; (3) Real-time multimodal interaction allowing pause, text/voice questions, and avatar/text responses.

Result: Demonstrated on a medical imaging course with accurate retrieval, low latency, and positive user experience. The system provides content-aware, engaging real-time support using lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading.

Conclusion: ALIVE shows how multimodal AI combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment can significantly enhance recorded lectures' pedagogical value, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

Abstract: Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline.
  We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.
  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.
  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy for small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios for underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR.

Method: 1) B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis with FDTD simulation validation; 2) DCO-YOLO framework integrating DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention into YOLOv11; 3) 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm with geometric constraints for multi-view annotation association.

Conclusion: Integrates deep learning optimization with 3D GPR physical characteristics, providing efficient and reliable technical framework for intelligent underground pipeline recognition and localization.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV360 is an end-to-end framework for efficient 360-degree video compression that decodes only user-selected viewports instead of entire panoramic frames, achieving 7x memory reduction and 2.5x speedup over prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRV methods for video compression suffer from high memory usage and slow decoding when applied to high-resolution 360-degree videos, making real-time applications impractical.

Method: NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction directly into the decoding process and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time, enabling selective reconstruction of only the user's current viewport.

Result: On 6K-resolution videos, NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV (prior work), while delivering better image quality in objective metrics.

Conclusion: NeRV360 provides an efficient solution for 360-degree video compression by selectively decoding only the needed viewport, making real-time applications practical while maintaining high quality.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

### [42] [Beyond Weight Adaptation: Feature-Space Domain Injection for Cross-Modal Ship Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20892)
*Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Zhelin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Domain Representation Injection (DRI), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for cross-modality ship re-identification that injects domain-specific representations into frozen vision foundation models via feature space optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modality ship re-ID faces modality discrepancies, and existing methods require large paired datasets for pre-training. Vision foundation models show potential but generic PEFT methods perform suboptimally on limited-capacity models when operating in weight space.

Method: DRI keeps VFM frozen, uses lightweight Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations, adaptively transforms them via Modulator using contextual information, and injects them into intermediate layers via additive fusion to reshape feature distribution.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance with minimal parameters: 57.9% and 60.5% mAP on HOSS-ReID dataset using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters respectively.

Conclusion: DRI effectively bridges modality gaps in cross-modality ship re-ID by optimizing in feature space rather than weight space, preserving general knowledge while adapting to downstream tasks with minimal trainable parameters.

Abstract: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) is critical for achieving all-day and all-weather maritime target tracking, yet it is fundamentally challenged by significant modality discrepancies. Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\% and 60.5\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, and early detection of pulmonary nodules is crucial for improving survival rates. Current multimodal fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, creating a need for more effective multimodal information fusion approaches.

Method: The authors propose a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network with: 1) Global-Local Feature Encoder to capture local, global, and fused nodule characteristics; 2) Dual-Graph Construction organizing multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs; 3) Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module for refined feature integration. They also compiled the novel NLST-cmst multimodal dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments on both the NLST-cmst and CSTL-derived datasets show that DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DGSAN framework provides an effective solution for multimodal and temporal information fusion in pulmonary nodule classification, addressing limitations of previous fusion methods and demonstrating superior performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models on compressed images, analyzing performance gaps, and proposing a universal adaptor to improve VLM performance on low-bitrate compressed images by 10-30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs work well with high-bitrate compressed images, but their ability to handle low-bitrate compressed images remains unexplored. With growing demand for VLM applications, efficient compression of image inputs is increasingly important, creating a need to understand and improve VLM performance on compressed images.

Method: 1) Created first comprehensive benchmark with over 1 million compressed images using various codecs and tasks; 2) Analyzed performance gap sources: information loss during compression vs. VLM generalization failure; 3) Proposed a universal VLM adaptor to enhance performance across different codecs and bitrates.

Result: Identified that only the generalization gap (not information loss) can be mitigated for compressed images. The proposed universal adaptor improves VLM performance by 10-30% across images with varying codecs and bitrates.

Conclusion: The benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights for bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images, enabling more efficient VLM applications with compressed inputs.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

*Seongmin Jung,Seongho Choi,Gunwoo Jeon,Minsu Cho,Jongwoo Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoGrounder is a generalizable 3D visual grounding framework that uses panoramic renderings with 3D features as intermediate representation, leveraging pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning, achieving SOTA results with superior generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised 3D visual grounding models have limited generalization due to scarce 3D vision-language datasets and weaker reasoning capabilities compared to modern VLMs. There's a need for approaches that can leverage the strong vision-language reasoning of pretrained 2D VLMs while handling 3D scene understanding.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Places compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering scene layout/geometry, 2) Grounds text queries on each panoramic rendering using pretrained 2D VLMs, 3) Fuses per-view predictions into single 3D bounding box via lifting. Uses panoramic renderings augmented with 3D semantic/geometric features as intermediate representation between 2D and 3D.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks. Demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings compared to traditional supervised models.

Conclusion: PanoGrounder successfully bridges 2D VLMs with 3D reasoning through panoramic representations, offering a generalizable solution for 3D visual grounding that leverages the strong vision-language capabilities of pretrained models while maintaining 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical bridge from vision-language perception to robotics, requiring both language understanding and 3D scene reasoning. Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity, unlike task-specific techniques that focus mainly on consolidating inter-modal information.

Method: Proposes SMC-Mamba with three key components: 1) Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module for preserving fine details and enhancing global representations, 2) Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module for dynamic expert collaboration and cross-modal feature integration, and 3) Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL) for preserving high-frequency information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art image fusion algorithms in various tasks including infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: SMC-Mamba provides an effective framework for general image fusion that enhances performance across multiple modalities and downstream tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Image fusion integrates complementary information from different modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D open-vocabulary segmentation using 3D Gaussian Splatting suffer from inefficient rendering of high-dimensional features, requiring codebooks or compression that cause information loss and degrade segmentation quality.

Method: Proposes Quantile Rendering (Q-Render) that sparsely samples only dominant Gaussians along each ray instead of all intersecting Gaussians, and Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net) that predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ScanNet and LeRF datasets while achieving real-time rendering with ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps.

Conclusion: Q-Render enables efficient high-dimensional feature rendering for 3D open-vocabulary segmentation without information loss, combining high fidelity with real-time performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps. Code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: TVP introduces a transductive visual programming framework that learns reusable tools from experience rather than speculation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual programming methods for spatial reasoning rely on fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before problem-solving, leading to suboptimal programs and poor tool utilization.

Method: TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating solutions in an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library, enabling increasingly powerful problem-solving.

Result: TVP achieves SOTA on Omni3D-Bench, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and previous best visual programming by 11%. Learned tools are used 5x more frequently than inductive ones and generalize well to unseen spatial tasks.

Conclusion: Experience-driven transductive tool creation is a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Amodal completion framework using multi-agent reasoning with semantic planning before visual synthesis, featuring verification agents and diverse hypothesis generation, plus a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior progressive approaches for amodal completion (inferring invisible object parts) suffer from inference instability and error accumulation, lacking semantic consistency and structural integrity.

Method: Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. Uses specialized agents for upfront reasoning to generate structured plans before pixel generation. Includes: (1) self-correcting Verification Agent with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to fix segmentation and identify occluders, and (2) Diverse Hypothesis Generator for multiple plausible semantic interpretations of invisible regions.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets. Introduces MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric validated against human judgment and ground truth.

Conclusion: The framework enables visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis by explicitly planning before generation, addressing limitations of progressive approaches and providing robust evaluation standards.

Abstract: Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: REM is a new paradigm for synthetic image detection that shifts from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images, achieving 7.5% average improvement over SOTA methods with strong generalization to real-world degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors overfit to generator-specific artifacts and are sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect.

Method: Proposes Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM): 1) Introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, 2) Employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. Also builds RealChain benchmark covering open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation.

Result: Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark.

Conclusion: REM establishes a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions by shifting detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [51] [SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975)
*Yujin Noh,Inho Jake Park,Chigon Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPOT is a map-guided LLM agent that predicts vehicle trajectories across CCTV blind spots without training, using spatial information and beam search to maintain continuous tracking in multi-camera environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems suffer from blind spots between cameras, causing ID switching and trajectory loss, which reduces reliability of real-time path prediction in multi-camera environments.

Method: SPOT represents road structures and CCTV placements as spatial documents, transforms vehicle positions to world coordinates using CCTV FOV information, and performs beam search at intersections using map spatial data combined with vehicle movement patterns to predict next CCTV locations.

Result: Experiments in CARLA simulator show SPOT accurately predicts next CCTV locations in blind spots, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed map-guided LLM agent approach successfully addresses blind spot tracking challenges in multi-CCTV environments without requiring prior training, improving vehicle trajectory continuity.

Abstract: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

TL;DR: XGrid-Mapping is a hybrid neural LiDAR mapping framework combining sparse explicit grids for geometric priors with implicit dense grids for scene representation, achieving efficient large-scale incremental mapping with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural LiDAR mapping approaches either rely on dense implicit representations that underutilize geometric structure, or use voxel-guided methods that struggle with real-time performance, creating a need for more efficient and geometrically-aware mapping solutions.

Method: Proposes XGrid-Mapping: a hybrid grid framework combining sparse explicit grids (for geometric priors) with implicit dense grids (for scene enrichment). Uses VDB structure with submap-based organization to reduce computational load. Introduces distillation-based overlap alignment where preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones for consistency, and incorporates a dynamic removal module for robustness and sampling efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior mapping quality while overcoming efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods with real-time performance.

Conclusion: XGrid-Mapping successfully addresses the trade-off between geometric structure utilization and computational efficiency in neural LiDAR mapping, enabling efficient large-scale incremental mapping with improved quality and real-time performance.

Abstract: Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography are diagnostically challenging due to scarcity of rare lesion examples, limiting generative model capabilities and diagnostic precision.

Method: Proposed pipeline: 1) Train diffusion model on abundant normal X-rays, 2) Use pre-trained model to inpaint head lesions from diseased X-rays while preserving tail classes as augmented data, 3) Integrate Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module with Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses data scarcity for rare lung lesions through innovative diffusion-based data synthesis with LLM guidance, improving diagnostic capabilities for long-tailed pulmonary anomalies.

Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

Conclusion: PUFM++ advances point cloud upsampling through enhanced flow-matching with improved geometric fidelity, robustness to imperfect inputs, and better consistency with surface-based tasks, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: A feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that predicts scene properties from RGB image sequences with cross-view attention, plus consistency-based finetuning for real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view methods ignore cross-view relationships causing inconsistencies, while multi-view optimization methods are computationally expensive and slow. There's also a generalization gap between synthetic training data and real-world scenes.

Method: Proposes a feed-forward framework with alternating attention across views to capture intra-view lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency. Uses consistency-based finetuning strategy leveraging unlabeled real-world videos to enhance multi-view coherence and robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enables coherent scene-level reasoning in a single forward pass while addressing the real-world generalization problem through consistency-based finetuning with unlabeled video data.

Abstract: Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

Conclusion: NExT-Vid successfully addresses limitations of existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods by combining context-isolated autoregressive prediction with flow-matching decoding, achieving strong representations that outperform previous approaches in downstream visual tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and overfit with limited data or distribution shifts. Existing mask-based augmentation methods lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantic information.

Method: Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM) uses Granular-ball Computing (GBC) to guide a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process. It adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction. The method works well with both CNNs and Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: GBGM provides an effective, model-agnostic structure-aware data augmentation paradigm that integrates seamlessly into various vision architectures and enhances model robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but they still rely heavily on large-scale labeled data and tend to overfit when data are limited or distributions shift. Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method. Simple and model-agnostic, it integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers and provides a new paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.

Result: Demonstrates promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos with improved temporal consistency and reduced computational burden.

Conclusion: FluencyVE provides a simple yet effective approach for one-shot video editing that preserves text-to-image model capabilities while addressing temporal inconsistency and computational efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality.

Motivation: Traditional facial recognition models trained on visible light datasets perform poorly on infrared images due to domain shifts.

Introduces Self-attn Mamba module for enhanced global modeling of cross-modal features and improved inference speed.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superiority in both image quality and identity preservation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of infrared-to-visible face recognition by combining latent diffusion modeling with attribute preservation and efficient cross-modal feature processing, resulting in improved recognition performance for surveillance applications.

Abstract: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

TL;DR: NSP introduces cross-scale prediction for self-supervised denoising, decoupling noise decorrelation from detail preservation by training BSN on low-res inputs to predict high-res targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised real-world image denoising faces a fundamental trade-off: pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) in blind-spot networks either fragments fine details (with aggressive downsampling) or fails to remove correlated noise (with mild downsampling).

Method: Next-Scale Prediction (NSP) constructs cross-scale training pairs where blind-spot networks take low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details, effectively decoupling noise decorrelation from detail preservation.

Result: NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks and naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification.

Conclusion: NSP significantly alleviates the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation in self-supervised denoising, offering a novel paradigm that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised real-world image denoising remains a fundamental challenge, arising from the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details. Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Conclusion: KOREATECH-CGH dataset and amplitude projection technique provide valuable resources for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems, addressing the data scarcity problem in the field.

Abstract: Machine learning-based computer-generated holography (ML-CGH) has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet progress is constrained by the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale hologram datasets. To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.

Conclusion: The proposed reweighted logarithmic norm provides a more effective approximation than existing alternatives and demonstrates practical advantages in matrix completion tasks.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications. To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event camera-based 6DoF object pose tracking method using optical flow-guided 2D-3D hybrid features outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras face challenges like motion blur, sensor noise, occlusion, and lighting changes for object pose tracking. Event cameras offer high dynamic range and low latency advantages to address these issues.

Method: Uses optical flow-guided approach with 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction (corners and edges). Searches for corner optical flow by maximizing event-associated probability, establishes corner-edge correlations guided by optical flow, and iteratively optimizes 6DoF pose by minimizing corner-edge distances.

Result: Experimental results on both simulated and real events show the method outperforms event-based state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed optical flow-guided event camera method effectively addresses traditional camera limitations and achieves superior performance for 6DoF object pose tracking.

Abstract: Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DexAvatar is a framework that reconstructs accurate 3D hand and body poses from monocular sign language videos using learned priors, addressing limitations of current 2D datasets and poor 3D estimation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sign language generation relies on data-driven methods requiring precise 3D pose data, but existing datasets are mostly video-based with only 2D keypoints. Automatic 3D pose estimation from sign language videos suffers from self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur, resulting in poor reconstruction quality.

Method: DexAvatar uses learned 3D hand and body priors to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos.

Result: Achieves 35.11% improvement in body and hand pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art on the SGNify motion capture dataset, which is the only benchmark available for this task.

Conclusion: DexAvatar provides a novel solution for accurate 3D pose reconstruction from sign language videos, addressing critical limitations in current datasets and estimation methods for sign language generation applications.

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPath is a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that uses multi-stream control (raw text, high-level semantics, and prototypes) to enable fine-grained controllable generation, addressing data scarcity and terminological heterogeneity issues in computational pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology AI has a disconnect: understanding models are diagnostically competent but generative models only simulate pixels. Three key challenges hinder progress: 1) scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora, 2) lack of precise semantic control forcing reliance on non-semantic cues, and 3) terminological heterogeneity where different phrasings for the same concept impede reliable text conditioning.

Method: UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: 1) Raw-Text stream, 2) High-Level Semantics stream using learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles, and 3) Prototype stream for component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. The framework also curates a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated 68K subset to address data scarcity.

Result: UniPath achieves state-of-the-art performance with Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of real-image quality. The framework establishes a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology and demonstrates superior controllable generation capabilities.

Conclusion: UniPath successfully bridges the gap between understanding and generation in computational pathology by leveraging mature diagnostic understanding for controllable image generation. The framework addresses key challenges of data scarcity, semantic control, and terminological heterogeneity, with open access to curated datasets, source code, and pre-trained weights to advance the field.

Abstract: In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

TL;DR: A self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action learning framework called Decomposition and Composition that balances efficiency and effectiveness by decomposing fused multimodal features into unimodal features and using them as self-supervised guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal action understanding methods face a dilemma: late fusion improves performance but adds computational overhead, while early fusion with shared backbones is efficient but struggles with performance. Need to balance efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Decomposition and Composition framework. Decomposition strategy breaks down fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features and aligns them with ground truth unimodal counterparts. Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features as self-supervised guidance to enhance multimodal representation learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate the method achieves excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework successfully addresses the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in multimodal action understanding through its Decomposition and Composition strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal human action understanding is a significant problem in computer vision, with the central challenge being the effective utilization of the complementarity among diverse modalities while maintaining model efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

Conclusion: The work successfully introduces the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates multi-view information, showing the value of combining 2D and 3D features with dedicated aggregation for improved place recognition performance and generalization.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR. Our code and models will be made publicly available on Github https://github.com/dtc111111/UniPR-3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting diverse knowledge from documents is challenging due to different recognition methods needed for various elements. Table recognition requires three subtasks: structure, cell position, and content recognition. Existing models have good performance but lack explainability and have slow inference times.

Method: Proposes a multi-task model using non-causal attention to capture entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference.

Result: Demonstrated superiority both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses both performance and efficiency issues in table recognition, offering improved structure capture and faster inference compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval. Documents contain elements that require different recognition methods. Table recognition typically consists of three subtasks, namely table structure, cell position and cell content recognition. Recent models have achieved excellent recognition with a combination of multi-task learning, local attention, and mutual learning. However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference. The superiority is demonstrated both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

Method: Developed T2AV-Compass benchmark with 500 diverse prompts constructed via taxonomy-driven pipeline, and introduced dual-level evaluation framework integrating objective signal-level metrics (video/audio quality, cross-modal alignment) with subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol.

Result: Evaluation of 11 representative T2AV systems shows even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, and instruction following.

Conclusion: T2AV-Compass serves as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation, revealing significant improvement room for future models and highlighting the value of comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniRec-0.1B is a lightweight unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters that outperforms larger vision-language models and expert document parsing models while being 2-9x faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for unified text and formula recognition are large and computationally demanding, limiting their practical applications. There's a need for a lightweight yet powerful model that can handle both text and formulas across multiple document hierarchy levels.

Method: 1) Created UniRec40M dataset with 40M text, formula, and mixed samples; 2) Introduced hierarchical supervision training to handle structural variability across document hierarchies; 3) Developed semantic-decoupled tokenizer to separate text and formula representations; 4) Built comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese/English documents across domains and hierarchy levels.

Result: UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models while achieving 2-9× speedup. The model demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in unified text and formula recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight unified recognition model successfully addresses the computational limitations of large VLMs while maintaining superior performance, making unified document parsing more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: FreeInpaint is a tuning-free plug-and-play method that optimizes diffusion latents during inference to improve text-guided image inpainting, addressing prompt alignment and visual rationality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided image inpainting methods struggle to simultaneously maintain prompt alignment (faithfulness to user text) and visual rationality (visual fidelity) when using pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: Two key techniques: 1) Prior-guided noise optimization that steers model attention to valid inpainting regions by optimizing initial noise, and 2) Composite guidance objective that directs the denoising process by optimizing intermediate latents at each step.

Result: Extensive experiments with various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FreeInpaint in improving prompt alignment and visual rationality.

Conclusion: FreeInpaint provides a practical tuning-free solution that enhances text-guided image inpainting by optimizing diffusion latents during inference, achieving better balance between prompt faithfulness and visual quality.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

Motivation: While VLMs have shown success as general-purpose assistants, the authors question whether they can act as domain experts in specialized fields like marine science, which requires significant domain expertise and addresses unique challenges.

Method: The authors construct MarineEval, a comprehensive marine VLM dataset with 2,000 image-based QA pairs covering 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. Domain requirements are integrated into data construction and verified by marine experts. They benchmark 17 existing VLMs on this dataset.

Conclusion: The MarineEval benchmark reveals limitations of current VLMs in specialized domains and provides a foundation for future research to improve VLM capabilities in domain-specific applications like marine science.

Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided medical segmentation methods use unaligned image/text encoders requiring complex fusion modules. CLIP provides pre-aligned features but has three main limitations for medical imaging: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment.

Method: TGC-Net incorporates three key components: 1) Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, 2) Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and 3) Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

Result: Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: TGC-Net successfully addresses CLIP's limitations for medical segmentation through parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

Abstract: Marine visual understanding is essential for monitoring and protecting marine ecosystems, enabling automatic and scalable biological surveys. However, progress is hindered by limited training data and the lack of a systematic task formulation that aligns domain-specific marine challenges with well-defined computer vision tasks, thereby limiting effective model application. To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species.

### [76] [A Turn Toward Better Alignment: Few-Shot Generative Adaptation with Equivariant Feature Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21174)
*Chenghao Xu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EFR (Equivariant Feature Rotation) is a novel few-shot image generation method that aligns source and target domains in a self-rotated proxy feature space using learnable rotation matrices from a parameterized Lie Group, overcoming limitations of strict consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot image generation methods use consistency constraints (instance-level or distribution-level) that often fail: strict constraints amplify domain gap effects causing distorted content, while relaxed constraints fail to leverage source domain effectively. The domain distribution discrepancy and target sample scarcity hinder accurate adaptation.

Method: EFR aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. It performs adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space where alignment is conducted. Learnable rotation matrices bridge domain gap while preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on various commonly used datasets demonstrate that the method significantly enhances generative performance within the targeted domain compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: EFR provides an effective adaptation strategy for few-shot image generation that overcomes limitations of traditional consistency constraints by using equivariant feature rotation to bridge domain gaps while preserving structural information, enabling better knowledge transfer from source to target domains.

Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain.

*Chenghao Xu,Guangtao Lyu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes NAME, a hierarchical implicit neural representation framework for continuous human motion sequences with arbitrary frame rate interpolation/extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher frame rates improve smoothness and temporal coherence. Current methods lack ability to handle motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates through interpolation, inbetweening, and extrapolation.

Method: Uses Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with hierarchical temporal encoding to extract multi-scale temporal features, and integrates a parametric activation function based on Fourier transformations in the MLP decoder to enhance representation expressiveness.

Result: Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness and robustness in representing complex motion behaviors with high accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed NAME framework successfully enables continuous representation of human motion sequences with arbitrary frame rate manipulation capabilities, advancing motion sequence processing.

Abstract: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating high-fidelity 3D geometry with limited training resources, while improving geometric quality from publicly available datasets and enabling fine-grained detail synthesis.

Method: Two-stage generation pipeline: 1) Coarse global structure synthesis, 2) Detailed refinement using voxel-based approach with RoPE encoding. Includes comprehensive data processing with watertight processing and quality filtering. Decouples spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation, trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets despite limited resources.

Conclusion: UltraShape 1.0 provides an effective framework for high-quality 3D geometry generation with practical data processing and scalable diffusion approach, with code and models to be released for research community.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

TL;DR: VisRes Bench is a new benchmark that isolates visual reasoning abilities in VLMs across three complexity levels, revealing that current models perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations and have limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) truly perform visual reasoning or just rely on linguistic priors, and to create a benchmark that studies visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision.

Method: Introduces VisRes Bench with three levels of complexity: Level 1 tests perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations (blur, texture changes, occlusion, rotation); Level 2 tests rule-based inference over single attributes (color, count, orientation); Level 3 tests compositional reasoning requiring integration of multiple visual attributes. Uses over 19,000 controlled task images.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities and limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition.

Conclusion: VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research, highlighting the need for models that can perform true visual reasoning rather than just pattern recognition.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

Motivation: Existing on-body motion estimation methods have poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, hindering daily adoption. Need for practical, wearable solutions for XR interaction.

Method: Multimodal teacher-student framework integrating visual cues from egocentric cameras (smart glasses with forward/downward cameras) with inertial signals from consumer devices. Uses real-world training data (Ego-Elec dataset) instead of synthetic data.

Result: Outperforms baseline models in experiments, demonstrating effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation. Eliminates sim-to-real gap that constrained prior work.

Conclusion: EveryWear provides a lightweight, practical human motion capture approach using everyday wearables without calibration, enabled by real-world training data and multimodal fusion, advancing wearable motion estimation for daily applications.

Abstract: While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.

TL;DR: Proposes a task-agnostic method for training LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision, enabling better handling of vision-centric reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs are text-centric and struggle with predominantly visual reasoning tasks. Existing approaches that use helper images, depth maps, or image crops impose restrictive priors on visual abstractions, add annotation costs, and lack generalization across tasks.

Method: A task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode images in a task-adaptive way, allowing models to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision.

Result: Outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse vision-centric tasks, including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify. Also generalizes well to multi-task instruction tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses critical limitations of text-centric LMMs by enabling unsupervised discovery of visual reasoning tokens, leading to improved performance on vision-centric tasks without the need for expensive annotations or restrictive priors.

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what "useful" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.

Motivation: Real-world image-text retrieval faces challenges with vague/context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and scalability needs. Current methods struggle with incorporating temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions.

Method: Lightweight two-stage pipeline: 1) BM25-based candidate filtering using event-centric entity extraction to capture temporal/contextual signals, 2) BEiT-3 models for deep multimodal semantic reranking.

Result: Achieves mean average precision of 0.559 on OpenEvents v1 benchmark, substantially outperforming prior baselines.

Conclusion: Combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling enables accurate and efficient retrieval in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegMo: A novel framework for generating 3D human motions from text using segment-level alignment between text phrases and motion segments for finer-grained correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align text descriptions with human motion at the sequence level, ignoring the internal semantic structure. Both motion descriptions and sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller semantically coherent segments that can serve as atomic alignment units for finer-grained correspondence.

Method: Three-module framework: (1) Text Segment Extraction - decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases representing atomic actions; (2) Motion Segment Extraction - partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment - aligns text and motion segments using contrastive learning.

Result: SegMo improves strong baselines on two widely used datasets, achieving TOP 1 score of 0.553 on HumanML3D test set. The learned shared embedding space enables application to retrieval-style tasks like motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

Conclusion: Segment-level alignment provides finer-grained text-motion correspondence, improving motion generation quality and enabling additional applications through the learned shared embedding space.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-shot filmmaking is aesthetically sophisticated but expensive and constrained in reality. Existing video generation models use naive clip concatenation that lacks visual smoothness and temporal coherence.

Method: Three-pronged approach: 1) Lightweight intermediate-conditioning in DiT architecture with Adaptive Tuning for arbitrary-frame control; 2) High-quality dataset curation with Visual Expression SFT and Tailored DPO for motion rationality and transition smoothness; 3) Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference for memory-efficient long sequences.

Result: Achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, enabling transformation of fragmented materials into cohesive cinematic experiences.

Conclusion: DreaMontage provides a comprehensive solution for generating high-quality one-shot videos from diverse inputs, overcoming limitations of existing methods through innovative architectural modifications, training strategies, and efficient inference.

Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

TL;DR: Any-Modality AD framework for brain MRI anomaly detection that works with arbitrary modality combinations without retraining, using feature alignment and normal pattern reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical brain MRI anomaly detection faces challenges due to scarce abnormal annotations and frequent missing modalities in real workflows. Existing models require fixed modality configurations, repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations.

Method: Unified framework with dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder and feature distribution alignment that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations. Includes Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and INP-guided decoder to reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while amplifying abnormal deviations. Uses randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical anomaly detection under real-world, imperfect modality conditions, enabling robust performance with arbitrary modality availability without retraining.

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

*Weiqi Li,Zehao Zhang,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACD is a novel framework that uses attention supervision for direct conditional control in video diffusion models, achieving better alignment with conditioning signals while preserving temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for conditional video synthesis have limitations: classifier-free guidance provides limited controllability, while classifier-based guidance can lead to adversarial artifacts and limited effective control. There's a need for better alignment between generated videos and conditioning signals.

Method: Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD) uses attention supervision to align the model's attention maps with external control signals. The framework introduces sparse 3D-aware object layouts as conditioning signals, a dedicated Layout ControlNet, and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets show that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: ACD establishes an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis by providing direct conditional control through attention supervision, overcoming limitations of existing guidance methods.

Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

*Snehal Singh Tomar,Alexandros Graikos,Arjun Krishna,Dimitris Samaras,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image sequence generation method that factorizes generation into low-resolution sequence modeling followed by individual frame super-resolution, outperforming SoTA in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SoTA image sequence generation methods are inefficient and have bottlenecks when treating sequences as large stacked tensors. The authors aim to find a more effective way to model image sequence data for generative tasks.

Method: Factorize generation into two stages: 1) Generate coarse sequence at low resolution using a grid of subsampled frames with Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture inter-frame correlations, effectively extending 2D image generation to low-res 3D sequences without architectural changes; 2) Super-resolve each frame individually to add high-resolution details.

Result: Achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences compared to existing methods. Enables high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences with increased efficiency (at least 2x faster inference). Generalizes effectively across diverse data domains without requiring additional priors or supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed factorization approach overcomes key limitations of current SoTA image sequence generation, offering better quality, efficiency, and generalization while maintaining a straightforward formulation that extends existing 2D generators to sequence generation.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.

TL;DR: SpikeSurgSeg is a spike-driven video Transformer framework for surgical scene segmentation that achieves comparable accuracy to SOTA ANN models while reducing inference latency by 8× and accelerating 20× over foundation models, enabling real-time deployment on non-GPU platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for surgical scene segmentation have high computational demands that hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. SNNs offer efficiency but are limited by scarce labeled surgical data and sparse video representations.

Method: Proposes SpikeSurgSeg: 1) Surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining for SNNs using layer-wise tube masking for robust spatiotemporal representation learning, 2) Lightweight spike-driven segmentation head for temporally consistent predictions while maintaining low latency.

Result: Achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least 8×. Delivers over 20× acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines on EndoVis18 and SurgBleed datasets.

Conclusion: SpikeSurgSeg demonstrates the potential of SNNs for time-critical surgical scene segmentation, offering efficient real-time performance on non-GPU platforms while maintaining competitive accuracy with conventional deep learning models.

Abstract: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks that improves robustness to noisy, low-resolution document images by modeling row/column transitions as 1D signals with Gaussian convolution and statistical thresholding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing table structure extraction methods struggle with noisy, low-resolution document images. Transformer-based approaches have limited adaptability to degraded inputs, while mask-based edge detection techniques suffer from noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational costs when applied directly to images.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale signal-processing approach that models row and column transitions as 1D signals. Uses Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries.

Result: Improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) from 67% to 76% on PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method demonstrates robustness to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed signal-processing approach effectively addresses challenges in table structure extraction from noisy, low-resolution document images by providing robust edge detection that produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Abstract: Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Method: Created AndroidLens with 571 tasks from real user scenarios across 38 domains, featuring both static evaluation (preserving anomalies, multiple valid paths) and dynamic evaluation with milestone-based ATP measurement.

Result: Even best models achieve only 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% Average Task Progress, highlighting significant performance gaps in real-world mobile GUI automation.

Conclusion: AndroidLens reveals critical challenges in mobile GUI agents including handling environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention, providing a more realistic benchmark for future development.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents can substantially improve productivity by automating frequently executed long-latency tasks on mobile devices. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are still constrained to limited applications, simple tasks, and coarse-grained metrics. To address this, we introduce AndroidLens, a challenging evaluation framework for mobile GUI agents, comprising 571 long-latency tasks in both Chinese and English environments, each requiring an average of more than 26 steps to complete. The framework features: (1) tasks derived from real-world user scenarios across 38 domains, covering complex types such as multi-constraint, multi-goal, and domain-specific tasks; (2) static evaluation that preserves real-world anomalies and allows multiple valid paths to reduce bias; and (3) dynamic evaluation that employs a milestone-based scheme for fine-grained progress measurement via Average Task Progress (ATP). Our evaluation indicates that even the best models reach only a 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP. We also underscore key challenges in real-world environments, including environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TICON is a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that enriches tile embeddings with slide-level context for computational pathology applications, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tile encoder pipelines extract embeddings without considering slide-level context, which is essential for both local and global pathology tasks. Different tile encoders excel at different tasks, creating a need for a unified model that can contextualize embeddings from any tile-level foundation model.

Method: TICON uses a single shared transformer encoder pretrained with a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. It also includes an aggregator to form slide-level foundation models.

Result: TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (Patho-Bench). The slide-level foundation model pretrained with only 11K WSIs outperforms state-of-the-art models trained with up to 350K WSIs.

Conclusion: TICON successfully addresses the need for contextualized tile representations in computational pathology, providing a unified approach that improves performance across diverse tasks while being more data-efficient than existing slide-level foundation models.

Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.

*Avilasha Mandal,Chaoning Zhang,Fachrina Dewi Puspitasari,Xudong Wang,Jiaquan Zhang,Caiyan Qin,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided token pruning framework that improves SAM2's inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density before temporal propagation, achieving 42.5% faster inference and 37.4% lower GPU memory usage while maintaining segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's practical deployment is limited by high computational and memory costs from processing all visual tokens across time, regardless of their relevance to target objects, leading to quadratic memory attention overhead and reduced scalability.

Method: A text-guided token pruning framework that operates after visual encoding and before memory-based propagation. It uses a lightweight routing mechanism to rank tokens based on local visual context, semantic relevance from object-centric textual descriptions (user-provided or auto-generated), and uncertainty cues to preserve ambiguous/boundary regions.

Result: Achieves up to 42.50% faster inference and 37.41% lower GPU memory usage compared to unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, highlighting the potential of early token selection to improve scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

TL;DR: VLMs show 34% higher accuracy on famous vs ordinary buildings, revealing popularity bias and reliance on memorization rather than generalizable understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and systematically investigate popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models, which may rely on memorization of famous items rather than developing genuine understanding.

Method: Created YearGuessr dataset (55,546 building images with construction years, GPS, and popularity metrics), framed construction year prediction as ordinal regression, and introduced popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify bias.

Result: VLMs achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings vs ordinary ones, confirming they excel on popular/memorized items but struggle with unrecognized subjects, exposing critical reasoning flaws.

Conclusion: VLMs have significant popularity bias and rely on memorization rather than generalizable understanding, highlighting a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities that needs addressing.

Abstract: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiStream is an efficient autoregressive framework for high-resolution video generation that reduces computational redundancy through spatial, temporal, and timestep compression, achieving up to 107.5x faster denoising with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution video generation is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible due to the high computational demands.

Method: HiStream uses three compression strategies: 1) Spatial compression - denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; 2) Temporal compression - chunk-by-chunk processing with fixed-size anchor cache for stable inference; 3) Timestep compression - applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent cache-conditioned chunks.

Result: On 1080p benchmarks, HiStream achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with up to 76.2x faster denoising than Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. HiStream+ (with all optimizations) achieves 107.5x acceleration, offering compelling speed-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: HiStream makes high-resolution video generation practical and scalable by dramatically reducing computational requirements while maintaining visual quality, addressing the fundamental bottleneck in diffusion-based video generation.

Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG system that integrates visual cues into knowledge graph construction, retrieval, and generation for improved cross-modal reasoning on complex documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with high-level conceptual understanding of long-form content due to limited context windows, while existing KG-based RAG solutions are text-only and miss valuable visual information that could enhance reasoning.

Method: Introduces multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that incorporates visual cues into KG construction, retrieval phase, and answer generation process to enable cross-modal reasoning.

Result: Experimental results show the approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based methods on both global and fine-grained QA tasks across textual and multimodal corpora.

Conclusion: Multimodal knowledge graphs provide structured support for reasoning that combines textual, visual, and spatial cues, enabling better holistic comprehension of complex documents like full-length books.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 are computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy on complex mathematical operations, despite progress in natural language reasoning.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Automated conversion of natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories for SFT data; 2) Agentic RL paradigm interleaving natural language generation with real-time code execution for autonomous tool-use learning; 3) Efficient training system with asynchronous rollout scheduling, partial rollout, and load balancing for 4-5x speedup.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on AIME24 (90.6%), AIME25 (86.4%), and HMMT25 (73.8%) benchmarks with AgentMath-30B-A3B model, achieving advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates language reasoning with computational precision, paving the way for more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

TL;DR: Current LLM safety mechanisms fail to understand context and user intent, creating exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically bypass using emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a critical gap in current LLM safety approaches: they focus on explicitly harmful content but overlook the inability to understand context and recognize user intent, creating systematic vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

Method: Empirical evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) by testing circumvention techniques including emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification. The study also examined reasoning-enabled configurations.

Result: Most LLMs' safety mechanisms were circumvented through the tested techniques. Reasoning-enabled configurations actually amplified exploitation effectiveness by increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate underlying intent. Only Claude Opus 4.1 showed some capability to prioritize intent detection over information provision in certain cases.

Conclusion: Current LLM architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities that require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities, rather than relying on post-hoc protective mechanisms.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoboSafe is a hybrid reasoning runtime safety system for embodied AI agents that uses backward reflection and forward prediction to detect and prevent hazardous actions while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language model (VLM) powered embodied agents are vulnerable to hazardous instructions, and existing safety defenses (static rule filters, prompt-level control) fail to handle implicit risks in dynamic, temporally dependent, context-rich environments.

Method: RoboSafe uses executable predicate-based safety logic with two complementary reasoning processes: 1) Backward Reflective Reasoning that revisits recent trajectories to infer temporal safety predicates and trigger replanning, and 2) Forward Predictive Reasoning that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from long-term memory and multimodal observations.

Result: RoboSafe reduces hazardous actions by 36.8% compared to leading baselines while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms confirm its practicality.

Conclusion: RoboSafe provides an adaptive, verifiable, interpretable, and executable safety logic that effectively addresses runtime safety challenges for embodied agents in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: To understand how the brain processes language through predictive inference, particularly in Deaf signers using visual language stimuli, and to develop methods for probing experience-driven generative models of perception.

Method: Used machine learning to decode EEG responses to dynamic sign language stimuli, measuring coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features. Applied entropy-based feature selection to identify frequency-specific neural signatures that distinguish linguistic from time-reversed (disrupted) stimuli.

Result: Identified distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension. Found experience-dependent neural signatures that correlate with age, showing how language processing develops with experience.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for investigating experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain, revealing specific neural signatures of predictive language processing in Deaf signers.

Abstract: Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language-conditioned grasping methods rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning in unstructured, cluttered environments.

Method: Uses CLIP-based visual/textual embeddings in hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) for instruction-adaptive predictions, and final refinement module for grasp consistency.

Result: Surpasses existing methods on OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets, shows strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries, and demonstrates practical effectiveness on real robotic platform.

Conclusion: LGGD enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves grasp feasibility with respect to task instructions, advancing language-guided robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Schrödinger's Navigator is a zero-shot object navigation framework that uses trajectory-conditioned 3D world modeling to imagine future observations, enabling robots to navigate cluttered environments with occlusions, risks, and moving targets without pre-built maps or task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation methods struggle in realistic cluttered environments with heavy occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets. There's a need for navigation approaches that can handle uncertainty in unseen spaces without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping.

Method: The framework treats unobserved space as plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Using egocentric visual inputs and candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. These imagined 3D observations are fused into navigation maps to update value maps, guiding policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets.

Result: Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios (severe static occlusions, unknown risks, dynamically moving targets) show consistent outperformance over strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation, showing that reasoning about plausible future worlds before acting improves navigation performance in challenging real-world environments.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.

These stem from over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics while neglecting rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain patterns that LLMs possess.

Method: ReaSeq leverages LLMs' world knowledge through explicit and implicit reasoning: (1) explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and (2) latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors.

Result: Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieved substantial gains: >6.0% improvement in IPV (Item Page View) and CTR (Click-Through Rate), >2.9% increase in Orders, and >2.5% boost in GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume).

Conclusion: The results validate the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches, demonstrating that leveraging LLMs' rich world knowledge can significantly improve industrial recommender system performance by addressing fundamental limitations of traditional log-based methods.

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.
  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.

### [104] [TexAvatars : Hybrid Texel-3D Representations for Stable Rigging of Photorealistic Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21099)
*Jaeseong Lee,Junyeong Ahn,Taewoong Kang,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: TexAvatars: A hybrid 3D head avatar representation combining analytic rigging with texel space for better generalization to extreme expressions and poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D head avatar approaches (rule-based rigging or neural deformation fields) fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, especially in extreme reenactment scenarios. Texel-based methods underutilize mesh structure and rely too heavily on neural regressors, weakening geometric consistency.

Method: Hybrid representation combining explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with spatial continuity of texel space. Predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians for smooth transitions across triangle boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings. Captures fine-grained expression effects like muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry with high fidelity.

Conclusion: TexAvatars' hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability for 3D head avatars in AR/XR applications.

Abstract: Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.

Method: Automated framework with meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation across six threat categories: reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation.

Result: On GPT-OSS-20B model: discovered 47 distinct vulnerabilities (21 high-severity, 12 novel patterns), 3.9× improvement in discovery rate over manual expert testing, 89% detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Framework enables scalable, systematic, and reproducible AI safety evaluations, advancing automated LLM red-teaming and contributing to building secure, trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, ensuring their security and alignment has become a critical challenge. Existing red-teaming practices depend heavily on manual testing, which limits scalability and fails to comprehensively cover the vast space of potential adversarial behaviors. This paper introduces an automated red-teaming framework that systematically generates, executes, and evaluates adversarial prompts to uncover security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our framework integrates meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation protocols spanning six major threat categories -- reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation. Experiments on the GPT-OSS-20B model reveal 47 distinct vulnerabilities, including 21 high-severity and 12 novel attack patterns, achieving a $3.9\times$ improvement in vulnerability discovery rate over manual expert testing while maintaining 89\% detection accuracy. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in enabling scalable, systematic, and reproducible AI safety evaluations. By providing actionable insights for improving alignment robustness, this work advances the state of automated LLM red-teaming and contributes to the broader goal of building secure and trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: LIRE++ is an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction that outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT has lower image quality than conventional CT, limiting its applications. Deep learning reconstruction methods are promising but face challenges: lack of ground truth data, memory limitations, and need for fast inference at clinical resolutions.

Method: Proposed LIRE++: end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme. Uses memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction for fast training/inference. Trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator.

Result: On synthetic data: 1 dB average improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data: 10 Hounsfield Units improvement in average Mean Absolute Error between reconstruction and planning CT compared to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method.

Conclusion: LIRE++ provides effective CBCT reconstruction with improved image quality, addressing key challenges of memory efficiency, computational speed, and parameter efficiency through rotational equivariance and multiscale architecture.

Abstract: Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is an important imaging modality nowadays, however lower image quality of CBCT compared to more conventional Computed Tomography (CT) remains a limiting factor in CBCT applications. Deep learning reconstruction methods are a promising alternative to classical analytical and iterative reconstruction methods, but applying such methods to CBCT is often difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, memory limitations and the need for fast inference at clinically-relevant resolutions. In this work we propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction. Memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction allow for fast training and inference, while rotational equivariance improves parameter efficiency. LIRE++ was trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator that we developed as well. Evaluated on synthetic data, LIRE++ gave an average improvement of 1 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data, LIRE++ improved the average Mean Absolute Error between the reconstruction and the corresponding planning CT by 10 Hounsfield Units with respect to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method.

### [109] [Real Time Detection and Quantitative Analysis of Spurious Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20634)
*Weiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to quantify alignment depth in continual learning, showing that shallow alignment (only 3-5 tokens) causes spurious forgetting, and proposes methods to detect and mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning approaches suffer from spurious forgetting due to shallow task alignment that only persists for a few output tokens, making models vulnerable to forgetting. Previous work only qualitatively described alignment and lacked automatic distinction mechanisms.

Method: Proposed a shallow vs deep alignment framework with: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy for shallow alignment and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

Conclusion: The shallow vs deep alignment framework provides the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth, explains why spurious forgetting occurs, and offers effective detection and mitigation strategies that significantly improve continual learning robustness.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.
  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.
  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

*Yuma Ichikawa,Naoya Takagi,Takumi Nakagawa,Yuzi Kanazawa,Akira Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHOTON replaces Transformer's flat token-by-token scanning with hierarchical multi-resolution context access, reducing KV-cache memory traffic and improving throughput by up to 1000x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from increasing prefill latency and memory-bound long-context decoding due to ever-growing KV-cache reads/writes dominating inference throughput rather than computation.

Method: PHOTON uses hierarchical autoregressive modeling with bottom-up encoder compressing tokens into low-rate contextual states and lightweight top-down decoders reconstructing fine-grained token representations.

Result: PHOTON outperforms Transformer-based language models in throughput-quality trade-off, especially in long-context and multi-query tasks, with up to 1000x higher throughput per unit memory.

Conclusion: Hierarchical multi-resolution context access significantly reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, making inference less memory-bound and more efficient for long-context applications.

Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

*Brian Lu,Hongyu Zhao,Shuo Sun,Hao Peng,Rui Ding,Hongyuan Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR improves causal reasoning generalization over SFT, but only with specific model sizes and training query levels, requiring sufficient initial reasoning competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when RLVR yields robust generalization for LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, specifically examining causal reasoning across different query levels and structural complexities.

Method: Construct datasets of causal graphs and queries across difficulty axes (query level: associational/interventional/counterfactual; structural complexity). Fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models (3B-32B) using RLVR vs SFT, varying model scale and training query levels.

Result: RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. RLVR's effectiveness depends on initial reasoning competence - with sufficient competence, it improves marginalization strategy and reduces intermediate probability calculation errors.

Conclusion: RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, but its benefits emerge only when the model has sufficient initial competence, showing conditional effectiveness based on model capability and training data composition.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

### [112] [Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326)
*Sida Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes noise in LLM evaluations, defining three noise types and proposing an all-pairs paired method to measure them, revealing predictable noise patterns and showing prediction noise dominates data noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM evaluations have unique noise characteristics that require specialized statistical methods to separate signal from noise effectively. Existing statistical approaches need adaptation to handle the specific noise patterns in LLM evals.

Method: Proposes the all-pairs paired method which applies paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs, measures three noise components (prediction noise, data noise, total noise) based on millions of question-level predictions across various evals and settings.

Result: Two key findings: 1) Each eval exhibits characteristic and highly predictable total noise levels across all model pairs; 2) Paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, meaning reducing prediction noise through averaging can significantly increase statistical power.

Conclusion: The findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments, providing practical tools for more powerful LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As IC dimensions shrink below lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces diffraction challenges.

Conclusion: MaskOpt provides a practical benchmark for advancing deep learning in cell- and context-aware mask optimization, addressing limitations of synthetic datasets and enabling more realistic evaluation of mask optimization models.

Abstract: As integrated circuit (IC) dimensions shrink below the lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces growing challenges from diffraction and process variability. Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models. Further context size analysis and input ablation studies confirm the importance of both surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs in achieving accurate mask generation.

TL;DR: HyDRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for mobile Vision Language Models that uses hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling to improve performance without increasing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile VLMs have high computational training requirements that hinder practical application. Standard LoRA with fixed rank is insufficient for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities.

Method: HyDRA implements hierarchical optimization (coarse-grained rank assignment to different layers and fine-grained rank adjustment within individual layers) and dynamic adjustment (end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to adjust ranks during fine-tuning).

Result: HyDRA consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 4.7% improvement across various model sizes without increasing trainable parameters, and in some tasks even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

Conclusion: HyDRA provides an effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning solution for mobile VLMs that addresses computational constraints while maintaining or improving performance compared to standard approaches.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of mobile-oriented VLMs, which offer a wide range of application scenarios. However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes memorization vs generalization in diffusion models through representation learning, showing memorization creates spiky representations while generalization produces balanced ones, with practical applications for detection and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models risk memorizing training data when overfit, but the distinction between memorization and generalization is not well understood. The paper aims to analyze this through the lens of representation learning to understand what makes diffusion models generalize versus simply memorize.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE) to prove representation differences, plus validation on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models. Also proposes representation-based memorization detection and training-free editing via representation steering.

Result: Memorization corresponds to storing raw training samples in weights, creating localized "spiky" representations. Generalization captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. These patterns hold in both theoretical models and practical diffusion models.

Conclusion: Learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling. The representation-based approach enables practical applications like memorization detection and precise control through representation steering.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized "spiky" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.

TL;DR: STLDM is a diffusion-based model for precipitation nowcasting that combines deterministic forecasting with generative enhancement to overcome blurry predictions and poor accuracy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation nowcasting is critical for preventing weather damage, but existing approaches struggle with complex, stochastic nature - deterministic models produce blurry predictions while generative models have poor accuracy.

Method: STLDM uses a diffusion-based architecture that learns latent representation end-to-end with Variational Autoencoder and conditioning network. It decomposes the task into: 1) deterministic forecasting via conditioning network, and 2) enhancement stage via latent diffusion model.

Result: Experimental results on multiple radar datasets show STLDM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while also improving inference efficiency.

Conclusion: STLDM provides an effective solution for precipitation nowcasting by combining deterministic and generative approaches, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing methods.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

Motivation: Hard-label black-box adversarial attacks face prohibitive query complexity as they only have access to top-1 predicted labels, making practical deployment challenging. Existing methods need more efficient optimization.

Method: ARS-OPT: Momentum-based algorithm inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient that proactively estimates gradient with respect to future ray direction using accumulated momentum. PARS-OPT: Enhanced version incorporating surrogate-model priors into gradient estimation for faster convergence.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates with faster, more stable optimization. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate superiority over 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed momentum-based optimization approach with Nesterov acceleration and surrogate priors significantly reduces query complexity in hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, making them more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

### [118] [Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21315)
*Roy Turgeman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the data processing inequality's practical implications by showing that pre-classification processing can improve classification accuracy for finite training samples, despite the theoretical optimality of Bayes classifier.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why low-level processing (like denoising or encoding) is commonly used before classification tasks in practice, despite the data processing inequality suggesting it shouldn't help, and to investigate when such preprocessing can be beneficial.

Method: Theoretical analysis of binary classification with a classifier converging to optimal Bayes classifier, proving existence of beneficial preprocessing for finite training samples. Empirical investigation of theoretical setup and practical study with deep classifiers on benchmark datasets, varying training size, class distribution, and noise levels.

Result: Proved that for any finite number of training samples, there exists pre-classification processing that improves classification accuracy. Found that class separation, training set size, and class balance affect the relative gain from preprocessing. Empirical results with deep classifiers showed consistent trends with theoretical findings.

Conclusion: While data processing inequality holds for optimal Bayes classifier, practical classifiers with finite training samples can benefit from preprocessing. The gap between theoretical optimality and practical implementation explains why low-level processing remains valuable in real-world classification tasks.

Abstract: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.
