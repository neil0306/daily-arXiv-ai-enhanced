Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes SGLC framework for high-resolution image dehazing that combines global contextual understanding with local detail enhancement, showing significant PSNR improvements on high-res datasets.", "motivation": "Existing dehazing models struggle with high-resolution images, often requiring downsampling or patch processing which degrades performance due to inability to effectively combine global context with local details.", "method": "SGLC framework with two components: Global Features Generator (GFG) for initial dehazing using broad contextual understanding, and Local Features Enhancer (LFE) for refining localized details and pixel-level features.

We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a\nnovel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with\npreference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought\n(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by\nemploying task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation\nmechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while\nautomatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike\ntraditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking\noptimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence\nregularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE\nshow consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B\nparameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including\nmedical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining\npreference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and\neffective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "RPRO is a novel framework combining reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought performance in medical question answering, outperforming larger models with a compact 1.1B parameter architecture.", "motivation": "Existing LLMs generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability in medical question answering, requiring a more robust approach to ensure clinical validity.", "method": "RPRO combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement using task-adaptive reasoning templates, probabilistic evaluation mechanism, groupwise ranking optimization based on Bradley-Terry model, and KL-divergence regularization.", "result": "Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines, with the 1.1B parameter model outperforming much larger 7B-13B models including medical-specialized variants.", "conclusion": "Combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs."}}

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder.

Most agent research focuses on GUI or\nembodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual\nworlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically\nrequire agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We\ninitially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance\ndegeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI\nand embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,\nrespectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human\nbrain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,\ndesigned from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose\nLayer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data\nby separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing\nshallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and\neliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or\nembodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces\nof GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from\nvarious sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under\ndifferent scenarios, especially in GUI tasks.

GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG\ngroups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across\ntiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During\nrasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small\ntiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results.
