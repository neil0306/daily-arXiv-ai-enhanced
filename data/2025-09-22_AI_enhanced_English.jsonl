The growing population of L2 English speakers has\nintensified the demand for reliable SLA, a critical component of Computer\nAssisted Language Learning (CALL). Existing efforts often rely on cascaded\npipelines, which are prone to error propagation, or end-to-end models that\noften operate on a short audio window, which might miss discourse-level\nevidence. This paper introduces a novel multimodal foundation model approach\nthat performs session-level evaluation in a single pass. Our approach couples\nmulti-target learning with a frozen, Whisper ASR model-based speech prior for\nacoustic-aware calibration, allowing for jointly learning holistic and\ntrait-level objectives of SLA without resorting to handcrafted features. By\ncoherently processing the entire response session of an L2 speaker, the model\nexcels at predicting holistic oral proficiency. Experiments conducted on the\nSpeak & Improve benchmark demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms\nthe previous state-of-the-art cascaded system and exhibits robust cross-part\ngeneralization, producing a compact deployable grader that is tailored for CALL\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel multimodal foundation model for spoken language assessment that performs session-level evaluation in a single pass, outperforming previous cascaded systems and showing robust cross-part generalization.", "motivation": "The growing population of L2 English speakers has intensified demand for reliable spoken language assessment.
