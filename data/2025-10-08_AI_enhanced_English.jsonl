In this work, we address the specific\nchallenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by\ndecomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.\nBuilding on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for\nthe temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel\nspectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and\nscalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer\npipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the\nliterature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based\nencoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same\nconcert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in\nwhich raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.\nWe show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points\nand provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art\nin multimodal automated video editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "A multimodal approach for automated video editing of classical music concerts, addressing when to cut (temporal segmentation) and how to cut (spatial selection) using audio-visual features.", "motivation": "Automated video editing is underexplored compared to video generation and scene understanding, especially for multicamera recordings of classical music concerts.", "method": "Uses multimodal architecture with log-mel spectrograms, optional image embeddings, and temporal features through convolutional-transformer pipeline for temporal segmentation; CLIP-based encoder with constrained distractor selection for spatial selection; pseudo-labeling dataset construction.", "result": "Outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and provided competitive visual shot selection.", "conclusion": "Advances the state of the art in multimodal automated video editing for classical music concert recordings."}}

The core challenge\nof RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels\nand continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced\nwith this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic\n`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an\ninformation bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts\n(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting\nprocess is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome\nthese fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that\nreconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us\nto harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel\ncontrol, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of\nconventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we\nreformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a\nvideo's holistic representation to its target mask.

However, in real-world\napplications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during\ndissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to\nthe generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a\nnovel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert\nModality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.\nIt consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to\ncompensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary\ninformation through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters\ncompensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature\ndistribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive\nweighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning.\nWe evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages,\ndemonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while\nmaintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news\ndetection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation,\nMMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation.
