Our key insight stems from an analysis of\nthe denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily\ncontrol motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be\neffectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.\nBuilding on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference\noptimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment\nmodules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep\ninterval.

Despite its\nnumerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still\nfaces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences\nbeyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention\nmechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,\nwhich offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of\nlong-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their\ninherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural\nfoundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.\nAvey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which\ncollaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for\nany given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,\nAvey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective\nprocessing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey\ncompares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range\nNLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Avey is a new neural architecture that avoids attention and recurrence, enabling efficient processing of long sequences while performing well on short-range NLP tasks.", "motivation": "Transformers face challenges with long sequences and quadratic attention complexity, while RNNs lack parallelism.
