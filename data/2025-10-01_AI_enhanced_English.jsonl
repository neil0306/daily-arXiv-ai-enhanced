In this\npaper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space\ndynamics to address the question: \"How do diffusion models memorize?\" We show\nthat memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during\nearly denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and\naccelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)\nmemorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is\nlarger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying\npredictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training\nimages into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and\nsteering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of\nintermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and\nreplaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising\nschedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,\nthese results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism\nof memorization in diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion models memorize training data due to early overestimation during denoising, where classifier-free guidance amplifies predictions and forces latent trajectories to converge toward memorized images.", "motivation": "To understand why and how diffusion models memorize training data, which raises privacy and copyright concerns, as prior work hasn't resolved the fundamental mechanisms behind memorization.", "method": "Analyzed latent space dynamics in diffusion and denoising processes, examining training loss, classifier-free guidance effects, noise predictions, and decomposition of intermediate latents to understand memorization mechanisms.", "result": "Found that memorization is driven by overestimation of training samples during early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and accelerates convergence toward memorized images.

In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based\non MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key\ncapabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven\nheuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving\nchain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG\nmechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly\ndetection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided\nheuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA\nemploys a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware\ntools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a\nchain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for\ncontinual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex\nscenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its\ngeneralizable and robust anomaly detection capability.
