### [1] [Shop-R1: Rewarding LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior in Online Shopping via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17842)
*Yimeng Zhang,Tian Wang,Jiri Gesi,Ziyi Wang,Yuxuan Lu,Jiacheng Lin,Sinong Zhan,Vianne Gao,Ruochen Jiao,Junze Liu,Kun Qian,Yuxin Tang,Ran Xue,Houyu Zhang,Qingjun Cui,Yufan Guo,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1, a novel RL framework, enhances LLMs' reasoning for simulating human behavior in online shopping by decomposing tasks into rationale generation and action prediction with distinct rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods are limited by the reasoning capabilities of models generating rationales, prompting the need for a more effective framework.

Method: Shop-R1 uses self-supervised rationale generation and hierarchical rewards for action prediction, with difficulty-aware scaling.

Result: Achieves a 65% relative improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: Shop-R1 effectively improves LLMs' reasoning for human behavior simulation in online shopping.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [2] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DG-PRM introduces a dynamic and generalizable approach to process reward modeling, using a reward tree and Pareto dominance for better performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs rely on heuristics and lack cross-domain generalization, while LLM-as-judge overlooks meaningful guidance. Static criteria fail in complex process supervision.

Method: DG-PRM uses a reward tree for fine-grained criteria and dynamically selects signals for step-wise scoring. Pareto dominance identifies discriminative pairs.

Result: DG-PRM outperforms benchmarks, boosts model performance, and adapts well to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DG-PRM offers a robust, adaptable solution for process reward modeling, demonstrating strong generalizability.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

### [3] [VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17896)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder is an interactive system for detecting and mitigating cognitive biases in analytical questions posed via NLIDBs, using contextual semantic mapping, a systematic analysis framework, and optimized LLM-powered prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of cognitive biases in analytical questions posed by users without statistical backgrounds, ensuring bias-free data analysis.

Method: Introduces a contextual semantic mapping framework, an analytical framework based on the Hard-to-Vary principle, and an optimized LLM-powered system for generating high-quality prompts.

Result: 82.5% of users reported improved analysis quality; VeriMinder outperformed alternatives by at least 20% in concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.

Conclusion: VeriMinder effectively mitigates 'wrong question' vulnerabilities in data analysis and is available as open-source software for broader adoption.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An efficient end-to-end system for holistic Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) using a single Whisper-small encoder and lightweight aggregator, outperforming text-based baselines with reduced parameters and improved data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve ASA for multi-part second-language tests by eliminating transcription needs and per-part models, making it practical for large-scale systems.

Method: Uses a single Whisper-small encoder for all spoken responses, combines information via a lightweight aggregator, and employs a data sampling strategy for training efficiency.

Result: Achieved RMSE of 0.384, outperforming the baseline (0.44), with reduced parameters (168M) and training on only 44.8% of speakers.

Conclusion: The system is efficient, scalable, and data-efficient, suitable for large-scale Computer-Assisted Language Learning.

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [5] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates six AI detection tools' ability to identify text generated by DeepSeek, including adversarial attacks like paraphrasing and humanization. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in literature about DeepSeek and assess AI detection tools' robustness against adversarial attacks.

Method: Tested six AI detectors on original, paraphrased, and humanized DeepSeek-generated text. Used few-shot and CoT prompting for classification.

Result: QuillBot and Copyleaks performed well on original/paraphrased text, but humanization reduced accuracy. Few-shot/CoT prompting achieved high accuracy (96% AI recall, 100% human recall).

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks, especially humanization, challenge AI detectors. Few-shot and CoT prompting are effective alternatives for classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

### [6] [Are LLM Belief Updates Consistent with Bayes' Theorem?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17951)
*Sohaib Imran,Ihor Kendiukhov,Matthew Broerman,Aditya Thomas,Riccardo Campanella,Rob Lamb,Peter M. Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Larger language models align better with Bayes' theorem when updating beliefs, measured by a new Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if larger, more capable language models update beliefs more consistently with Bayes' theorem when given evidence.

Method: Formulated the BCC metric, generated a dataset, and measured BCC across multiple pre-trained models, comparing parameters, training data, and benchmark scores.

Result: Larger and more capable models show more coherent credence assignments with Bayes' theorem.

Conclusion: Findings impact understanding and governance of large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance language model performance with minimal architectural changes by refining training strategies for diverse applications.

Method: Enhanced pre-training (10T tokens), SFT, DPO, continual pretraining, RL, and domain-specific tuning for reasoning and speed.

Result: TeleChat2.5 and T1 (115B params) outperform predecessors and proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) in reasoning and speed.

### [9] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB is a framework for efficiently editing knowledge in LLMs, preserving general abilities while scaling to large edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To update LLMs without retraining and avoid compromising general abilities or forgetting edited facts.

Method: Models linear L&E as a KV database and introduces NeuralDB with a non-linear gated retrieval module.

Result: NeuralDB excels in editing efficacy, generalization, and preserves performance in text tasks, scaling to 100,000 facts.

Conclusion: NeuralDB effectively edits LLMs at scale without degrading general capabilities.

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [10] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS introduces a gradient-based, token-level steering method for LLMs and VLMs, outperforming fine-tuning and baselines in accuracy, hallucination reduction, and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time steering methods use fixed vectors, ignore token-level causal influence, and underutilize gradients, especially in multimodal contexts.

Method: GrAInS uses contrastive gradient attribution (Integrated Gradients) to identify influential tokens, constructs directional steering vectors, and adjusts hidden activations during inference.

Result: GrAInS improves accuracy (13.22% on TruthfulQA), reduces hallucination (MMHal-Bench: 0.624 to 0.514), and boosts alignment (SPA-VL: +8.11%).

Conclusion: GrAInS offers fine-grained, interpretable control over model behavior without retraining, preserving fluency and general capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

*Hoyeon Lee,Sejung Son,Ye-Eun Kang,Jong-Hwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, reducing reliance on costly manual annotations in text-to-speech systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for phrase break prediction require extensive human annotations, which are costly and inconsistent due to speech variability. LLMs offer a potential solution by generating synthetic data.

Method: The study leverages LLMs to create synthetic phrase break annotations, comparing them with traditional annotations and evaluating their effectiveness across multiple languages.

Result: LLM-based synthetic data generation successfully addresses data challenges in phrase break prediction, demonstrating its viability for speech-related tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs present a promising solution for reducing manual annotation efforts in the speech domain, particularly for phrase break prediction.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

*Tevin Atwal,Chan Nam Tieu,Yefeng Yuan,Zhan Shi,Yuhong Liu,Liang Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the diversity and privacy risks of synthetic data from LLMs, proposes metrics for assessment, and introduces a prompt-based method to improve diversity while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored diversity and privacy risks of synthetic data generated by LLMs, which is increasingly used in data-driven applications.

Method: Proposes metrics to assess diversity (linguistic expression, sentiment, user perspective) and privacy (re-identification risk, stylistic outliers) of synthetic data. Introduces a prompt-based approach to enhance diversity while preserving privacy.

Result: Experiments show LLMs have limitations in generating diverse and privacy-preserving synthetic data. The prompt-based method improves diversity without compromising privacy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better evaluation and methods to ensure synthetic data from LLMs is diverse and privacy-preserving, offering a practical solution through prompt-based enhancement.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

### [13] [TELEVAL: A Dynamic Benchmark Designed for Spoken Language Models in Chinese Interactive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18061)
*Zehan Li,Hongjie Chen,Yuxin Zhang,Jing Zhou,Xuening Wang,Hang Lv,Mengjie Du,Yaodong Song,Jie Lian,Jian Kang,Jie Li,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TELEVAL is a dynamic benchmark for evaluating spoken language models (SLMs) in realistic Chinese conversational settings, focusing on implicit cues and user-centered metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLM benchmarks often misalign with real-world conversational interactions, prompting the need for a more user-centered evaluation framework.

Method: TELEVAL evaluates SLMs across three dimensions (Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, System Abilities) using dialogue formats and separate text/audio output assessments.

Result: Experiments show current SLMs still lag in natural conversational tasks, highlighting room for improvement.

Conclusion: TELEVAL aims to advance dialogue-oriented SLMs by providing a user-experience-focused evaluation framework.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

### [14] [Hybrid and Unitary Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models: Methods and Benchmarking under Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18076)
*Haomin Qi,Zihan Dai,Chengbo Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques for LLMs, introduces a hybrid method combining BOFT and LoRA-GA, and adapts uRNN principles to transformers. The hybrid method outperforms baselines, reducing resource use while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, creating a need for efficient methods that reduce resource demands without sacrificing performance.

Method: The paper evaluates PEFT techniques (LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, uRNN) and introduces a hybrid strategy combining BOFT's stability with LoRA-GA's rapid convergence. It also adapts uRNN principles to transformers for gradient stability.

Result: The hybrid method outperforms individual PEFT techniques, achieving near full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing training time by 2.1x and memory usage by 50%.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is a practical and scalable solution for fine-tuning LLMs under resource constraints, validated by benchmarks like GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench, and HumanEval.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

*Riley Carlson,John Bauer,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces updated 2024 English GloVe models, addressing gaps in documentation and incorporating modern linguistic and cultural relevance, while maintaining performance on traditional tasks and improving on newer NER datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original 2014 GloVe models lacked detailed documentation and needed updates to reflect evolving language and cultural contexts.

Method: Two sets of word embeddings were trained using Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma, with evaluation through vocabulary comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks.

Result: The 2024 models include new culturally relevant words, perform similarly on structural tasks, and show improved performance on recent NER datasets, especially non-Western newswire data.

Conclusion: The updated GloVe models provide better documentation, modern relevance, and enhanced performance for contemporary NLP tasks.

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

*Hongjie Chen,Zehan Li,Yaodong Song,Wenming Deng,Yitong Yao,Yuxin Zhang,Hang Lv,Xuechao Zhu,Jian Kang,Jie Lian,Jie Li,Chao Wang,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM is a spoken language model that incorporates paralinguistic and speaker characteristics, improving natural spoken interactions beyond text semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models overlook paralinguistic cues (e.g., emotion, dialect) in speech. GOAT-SLM aims to address this gap for more natural interactions.

Method: Uses a dual-modality head architecture and modular, staged training to align linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information.

Result: Outperforms existing models on TELEVAL benchmark, excelling in emotion, dialect, and age-sensitive tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for modeling beyond linguistic content, advancing socially aware spoken language systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

*Xiaoyuan Li,Moxin Li,Wenjie Wang,Rui Men,Yichang Zhang,Fuli Feng,Dayiheng Liu,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to perform visual operations via code in multi-modal mathematical reasoning, focusing on code generation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of MLLMs primarily focus on text-only reasoning, leaving their visual operation capabilities via code unexplored.

Method: The study introduces a framework with two tasks: Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) and Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE), evaluated on a dataset of five mathematical figure types. Nine MLLMs are tested.

Result: Results show MLLMs significantly lag behind human performance in fine-grained visual operations.

Conclusion: The work highlights the gap in MLLMs' visual operation capabilities and provides a benchmark for future improvements.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs in HIV management, introduces HIVMedQA benchmark, and finds Gemini 2.5 Pro performs best, highlighting challenges like reasoning and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' potential in HIV care due to its complexity and the lack of benchmarking studies, addressing concerns about accuracy and clinical integration.

Method: Developed HIVMedQA benchmark with clinician input, evaluated 10 LLMs using prompt engineering, and assessed performance across multiple dimensions.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed others; proprietary models led, performance dropped with complexity, and fine-tuning didn't guarantee superiority.

Conclusion: Targeted development and evaluation are needed for safe, effective LLM use in clinical care, given current limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

### [19] [Sticking to the Mean: Detecting Sticky Tokens in Text Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18171)
*Kexin Chen,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Haonan Zhang,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer-based text embedding models suffer from 'sticky tokens' that disrupt embedding reliability. The paper introduces STD for detection, identifies 868 such tokens, and shows their negative impact on tasks like clustering and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the issue of 'sticky tokens' in Transformer-based text embedding models, which degrade embedding reliability and downstream performance.

Method: Introduces Sticky Token Detector (STD), a method for detecting sticky tokens through sentence and token filtering, applied to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families.

Result: Found 868 sticky tokens, often from special/unused vocabulary or fragmented subwords. These tokens cause up to 50% performance drops in tasks like clustering and retrieval.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved tokenization strategies and model design to mitigate sticky tokens' impact on text embedding applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

*Wonjun Jeong,Dongseok Kim,Taegkeun Whangbo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOPE is a framework to mitigate selection bias in LLM evaluations by redistributing answer slots and blocking near-miss guesses, improving fairness and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exploit biases in option positions or labels, inflating scores without genuine understanding, necessitating a debiasing method.

Method: SCOPE uses a null prompt to estimate position-bias distributions, redistributes answer slots inversely, and prevents semantically similar distractors from adjacency.

Result: SCOPE outperforms existing debiasing methods, showing stable improvements and clearer confidence distributions.

Conclusion: SCOPE enhances fairness and reliability in LLM evaluations, setting a new standard.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) with existing operational processes, using the SECI model and PDCA cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning knowledge management activities in ISO30401 with operational processes, particularly for ISO9001-compliant organizations.

Method: Recaps process modeling principles (ISO9001) and proposes integration of KMS using the SECI model and PDCA cycles.

Result: Demonstrates how KMS can entwine with other processes in an Integrated Management System.

Conclusion: Effective integration of KMS with operational processes is achievable through SECI and PDCA, enhancing alignment with strategic goals.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTP is a defense method for RAG systems that detects poisoned documents by analyzing token gradients and masking, achieving high-precision filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are vulnerable to poisoned documents, which can lead to harmful outputs. GMTP aims to mitigate this risk.

Method: GMTP identifies high-impact tokens using gradients, masks them, and checks probabilities via an MLM to detect malicious documents.

Result: GMTP filters over 90% of poisoned content while preserving relevant documents, maintaining robust performance.

Conclusion: GMTP effectively defends RAG systems against adversarial attacks, ensuring reliable retrieval and generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning improves LLMs' ability to follow instructions but increases susceptibility to misinformation by making models overly reliant on user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how instruction-tuning affects LLMs' vulnerability to misinformation, given its potential real-world implications.

Method: Investigated the impact of instruction-tuning on LLMs' acceptance of misinformation, comparing instruction-tuned and base models, and analyzing factors like prompt structure and warnings.

Result: Instruction-tuned LLMs are more likely to accept misinformation from users, shifting reliance from the assistant to the user role. Factors like prompt structure and warnings also influence susceptibility.

Conclusion: Systematic approaches are needed to mitigate instruction-tuning's unintended consequences and improve LLM reliability in real-world use.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

*Xinrui Chen,Hongxing Zhang,Fanyi Zeng,Yongxian Wei,Yizhi Wang,Xitong Ling,Guanghao Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prune&Comp is a training-free layer pruning method for LLMs that compensates for hidden state magnitude gaps, improving performance without runtime overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Removing layers in LLMs causes hidden state magnitude gaps, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Estimates and compensates for magnitude gaps by rescaling weights offline, integrated with iterative pruning.

Result: Reduces perplexity by nearly half and retains 93.19% QA performance, outperforming baselines by 4.01%.

Conclusion: Prune&Comp effectively mitigates performance degradation in pruned LLMs, enhancing existing pruning metrics.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Locate-and-Focus method to improve terminology translation in direct speech translation by minimizing noise and better utilizing translation knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate terminology translation in speech translation is challenging due to noise interference and underutilized translation knowledge.

Method: The Locate-and-Focus method locates terminology-containing speech clips to construct translation knowledge, then associates it with audio and textual modalities for better focus.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively locates terminologies and improves translation success while maintaining general performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances terminology translation in speech translation by focusing on relevant knowledge and reducing noise.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

TL;DR: The paper compares six OCR engines for Low-Resourced Languages (Sinhala and Tamil), finding Surya best for Sinhala and Document AI for Tamil. It also introduces a synthetic Tamil OCR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCR for Latin scripts is well-researched, but Low-Resourced Languages with unique scripts remain a challenge. This study aims to evaluate OCR performance for Sinhala and Tamil.

Method: Comparative analysis of six OCR engines (commercial and open-source) using five measurement techniques for accuracy at character and word levels.

Result: Surya performed best for Sinhala (WER 2.61%), while Document AI excelled for Tamil (CER 0.78%).

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of specific OCR engines for Sinhala and Tamil and introduces a new synthetic dataset for Tamil OCR benchmarking.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM uses LoRA to adapt LLMs to specific styles without paired data, preserving instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise communication requires LLMs to adopt brand or authorial tones, but existing corpora lack instruction-response formatting.

Method: Train LoRA adapters on unstructured stylistic corpora, then merge with an instruction-following model.

Result: Improved stylistic consistency and preserved task performance, validated by human evaluations.

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM efficiently personalizes LLMs for stylistic needs.

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'overthinking backdoors' as a novel attack on large reasoning models (LRMs), enabling precise control over reasoning verbosity via data poisoning while maintaining output correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and exploit vulnerabilities in LRMs by introducing tunable backdoors that manipulate reasoning verbosity without compromising answer accuracy.

Method: A data poisoning approach using tunable triggers (repetitions) and verbose chain-of-thought responses generated by a teacher LLM to inject redundant refinement steps.

Result: Empirical results show controllable multi-fold increases in reasoning length without degrading answer correctness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of stealthy, resource-consuming attacks on LRMs, highlighting a new security concern for such models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MT models often rely on stereotypes for gender inference in ambiguous cases, failing to show uncertainty when needed. Debiasing affects ambiguous and unambiguous translations differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biased gender inference in MT models and ensure they handle ambiguity appropriately by maintaining uncertainty when gender is unclear.

Method: Use semantic uncertainty metrics to evaluate models' gender accuracy and uncertainty in ambiguous vs. unambiguous cases, and assess debiasing effects.

Result: High-accuracy models don't show expected uncertainty in ambiguous cases. Debiasing impacts ambiguous and unambiguous translations independently.

Conclusion: MT models need better handling of gender ambiguity, balancing accuracy and uncertainty, with debiasing tailored to context.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

*Yifu Chen,Bingchen Huang,Zhiling Wang,Yuanchao Du,Junfeng Luo,Lei Shen,Zhineng chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TDR, a framework to improve in-context learning (ICL) by decoupling task-specific examples and modeling LLM feedback for better retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in retrieving high-quality ICL examples include cross-task data distribution issues and fine-grained feedback integration.

Method: TDR decouples task-specific examples and uses LLM feedback to train the retrieval module.

Result: TDR improves performance across 30 NLP tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: TDR is a plug-and-play solution that enhances ICL by refining example retrieval.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

*Ariana Sahitaj,Premtim Sahitaj,Veronika Solopova,Jiaao Li,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework combining human expertise and LLM assistance improves propaganda detection on social media by enhancing annotation consistency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in propaganda detection due to task complexity and limited labeled data.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical taxonomy, conducts human annotation, implements LLM-assisted pre-annotation, and fine-tunes SLMs on LLM-generated data.

Result: Significant improvements in annotation agreement and time-efficiency, with smaller models trained via knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: Supports scalable, robust propaganda detection and transparent media ecosystems, aligning with SDG 16.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [33] [CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18392)
*Asaf Yehudai,Lilach Eden,Yotam Perlitz,Roy Bar-Haim,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR is an interactive, open-source tool for detailed error analysis of LLMs, providing textual feedback, system-level error issues, and visualizations to understand model performance beyond single scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations lack actionable insights, focusing only on scores or rankings without explaining why models perform as they do.

Method: CLEAR generates per-instance feedback, identifies system-level error issues, quantifies their prevalence, and offers an interactive dashboard for analysis.

Result: CLEAR successfully analyzes RAG and Math benchmarks, demonstrating its utility through a user case study.

Conclusion: CLEAR bridges the gap in LLM evaluation by providing detailed, actionable insights into model performance.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

### [34] [Factual Inconsistencies in Multilingual Wikipedia Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18406)
*Silvia Cappa,Lingxiao Kong,Pille-Riin Peet,Fanfu Wei,Yuchen Zhou,Jan-Christoph Kalo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's structured content, particularly tabular data, and proposes a methodology to analyze them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's independent updates across languages lead to factual inconsistencies, affecting reliability and AI systems relying on it.

Method: Developed a methodology to collect, align, and analyze tables from multilingual Wikipedia articles, defining inconsistency categories.

Result: Applied quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.

Conclusion: Findings impact factual verification, multilingual knowledge interaction, and AI system reliability.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

### [35] [FinDPO: Financial Sentiment Analysis for Algorithmic Trading through Preference Optimization of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18417)
*Giorgos Iacovides,Wuyang Zhou,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinDPO introduces a finance-specific LLM framework using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for sentiment analysis, outperforming SFT models by 11% and enabling practical portfolio strategies with strong returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online financial opinions impact trading, but SFT LLMs struggle with generalization and domain-specific nuances.

Method: FinDPO uses DPO for human preference alignment and a 'logit-to-score' conversion for continuous sentiment scores.

Result: Achieves 11% better performance than SFT models, with 67% annual returns and a Sharpe ratio of 2.0.

Conclusion: FinDPO is a robust, finance-specific sentiment analysis tool with practical trading applications.

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

### [36] [AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442)
*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraTable is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Arabic tabular data, showing their limitations in complex reasoning tasks and proposing an automated evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underrepresentation of Arabic in tabular data benchmarks due to limited public resources and unique language features.

Method: A hybrid pipeline where LLMs generate initial content, followed by human expert filtering and verification.

Result: LLMs perform well on simple tasks but struggle with deeper reasoning and fact verification.

Conclusion: AraTable is a valuable resource for improving LLMs' performance on Arabic tabular data, with an automated evaluation framework matching human judgment.

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Punctuation restoration improves readability and post-processing in ASR, especially for low-resource languages like Bangla.

Method: Used XLM-RoBERTa-large for predicting four punctuation marks; built a diverse corpus and applied data augmentation (alpha = 0.20%).

Result: Achieved 97.1% accuracy on News, 91.2% on Reference, and 90.2% on ASR test sets, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes a baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration, providing public datasets and code for future low-resource NLP research.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

*Basel Alshaikhdeeb,Ahmed Abdelmonem Hemedan,Soumyabrata Ghosh,Irina Balaur,Venkata Satagopam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text, analyzing purpose, techniques, and evaluation methods, highlighting transformer architectures and utility evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy by generating synthetic medical text.

Method: Systematic review of 94 relevant articles from major databases, focusing on purpose, techniques, and evaluation methods.

Result: Transformer architectures (e.g., GPTs) dominate; utility is the main evaluation method. Synthetic text aids NLP tasks but privacy concerns persist.

Conclusion: Synthetic medical text improves NLP tasks but requires more human assessment for privacy. Advances could streamline workflows despite legal challenges.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraDe improves LLM-based tabular data generation by integrating sparse dependency graphs into attention mechanisms, outperforming existing methods by up to 12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with sparse feature-level dependencies in tabular data, diluting attention on critical relationships.

Method: GraDe uses a dynamic graph learning module guided by functional dependencies to prioritize key feature interactions.

Result: GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based methods by up to 12% on complex datasets and matches state-of-the-art in synthetic data quality.

Conclusion: GraDe offers a practical, minimally intrusive solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMT methods struggle with rigid visual-linguistic alignment and limited inference to trained multimodal domains.

Method: Constructs multimodal scene graphs and introduces GIIFT, a two-stage framework with a cross-modal Graph Attention Network adapter to learn and generalize multimodal knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Multi30K and WMT benchmarks, even without images during inference.

Conclusion: GIIFT effectively bridges the modality gap and generalizes to broader image-free translation domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid tokenization strategy combining 6-mer and BPE-600 improves DNA Language Models (DLMs), outperforming state-of-the-art models in next-k-mer prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional k-mer tokenization struggles with uneven token distribution and limited global context understanding, prompting the need for a hybrid approach.

Method: The paper merges 6-mer tokens with BPE tokens (600 cycles) to create a balanced, context-aware vocabulary for DLMs.

Result: The model achieved accuracies of 10.78% (3-mers), 10.1% (4-mers), and 4.12% (5-mers), surpassing NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy effectively captures local and global DNA patterns, advancing genomic language modeling for future biological research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

TL;DR: WINO, a training-free decoding algorithm, improves the quality-speed trade-off in DLLMs by enabling revokable decoding through a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLLMs suffer from a severe quality-speed trade-off due to irreversible decoding, leading to performance degradation.

Method: WINO introduces a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, drafting multiple tokens and verifying them using bidirectional context to refine suspicious ones.

Result: WINO accelerates inference by 6× on GSM8K with 2.58% higher accuracy and achieves a 10× speedup on Flickr30K with improved performance.

Conclusion: WINO effectively resolves the quality-speed trade-off in DLLMs, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Conclusion: The SRAG-MAV framework effectively enhances hate speech recognition, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing
Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel
SRAG-MAV framework that synergistically integrates task reformulation(TR),

TL;DR: AQuilt is a framework for creating instruction-tuning data from unlabeled data in specialized domains, improving model performance with reasoning and self-inspection while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models underperform in specialized domains, and existing methods are costly or limited in generalization.

Method: AQuilt constructs instruction-tuning data using unlabeled data, incorporating logic and inspection for reasoning and self-improvement.

Result: AQuilt matches DeepSeek-V3's performance at 17% of the cost and generates more task-relevant data.

Conclusion: AQuilt offers an efficient, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

### [48] [TRPrompt: Bootstrapping Query-Aware Prompt Optimization from Textual Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18618)
*Andreea Nica,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Saibo Geng,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt unifies textual feedback and numerical rewards for prompt optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results on GSMHard and MATH datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between heuristic-based and reward-trained prompt optimization methods by incorporating textual feedback directly into training.

Method: Introduces TRPrompt, a framework that iteratively improves prompts using textual feedback from LLMs, eliminating the need for prior dataset collection.

Result: TRPrompt produces state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for challenging math datasets (GSMHard and MATH).

Conclusion: TRPrompt effectively combines textual feedback and training, advancing prompt optimization without parameter updates.

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

### [49] [Checklists Are Better Than Reward Models For Aligning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18624)
*Vijay Viswanathan,Yanchao Sun,Shuang Ma,Xiang Kong,Meng Cao,Graham Neubig,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback (RLCF), a method using flexible, instruction-specific criteria to improve language models' instruction-following abilities, outperforming other alignment methods across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for adapting language models rely on fixed criteria, limiting their effectiveness. The goal is to broaden the impact of reinforcement learning by using instruction-specific feedback.

Method: RLCF extracts checklists from instructions, evaluates responses using AI judges and verifier programs, and combines scores to compute rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: RLCF improves performance on all tested benchmarks, including notable boosts in hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench (4 points), InFoBench (6 points), and win rate on Arena-Hard (3 points).

Conclusion: Checklist feedback is a key tool for enhancing language models' ability to support diverse user queries, demonstrating RLCF's superiority over existing alignment methods.

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a standalone autoregressive model for high-quality image generation, outperforming diffusion models like DALL-E 3 and SANA while offering flexibility and multi-task capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revitalize autoregressive models for image generation without relying on pretrained components, enabling unrestricted design and licensing freedom.

Method: Trained from scratch with a unified tokenization scheme, efficient decoding strategies (inference-time scaling, speculative Jacobi sampling), and handles tasks like generation, editing, and prediction.

Result: Matches or surpasses diffusion models on benchmarks (GenEval, DPG) and excels in multi-task performance (Graph200K).

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a versatile foundation model for unified multimodal generation, with released training details and code.

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B is a lightweight 3.3B parameter model for automated sports video analysis, excelling in fine-grained understanding and on-device deployment, outperforming larger models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports video analysis lacks fine-grained biomechanical understanding and relies on server-side processing, missing critical movement phases.

Method: Combines temporal motion difference sampling, self-supervised learning, DWT-VGG16-LDA keyframe extraction, V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder, and LLM decoder for sports action description.

Result: Achieves 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in validation metrics, excelling in information density, action complexity, and precision.

Conclusion: SV3.3B offers a computationally efficient, high-performance solution for detailed sports video analysis, surpassing larger models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++ is a training-free framework using Progressive Detail Injection (PDI) to improve text-to-image generation for complex prompts by decomposing them into simpler sub-prompts and refining stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple subjects and distinct attributes, prompting the need for a method mimicking human drawing processes.

Method: The framework decomposes complex prompts into sub-prompts, uses self-attention for global composition, and refines details with cross-attention and Centroid Alignment Loss.

Result: Detail++ outperforms existing methods on T2I-CompBench and a new style benchmark, especially for multi-object and complex stylistic scenarios.

Conclusion: Detail++ effectively addresses limitations in complex prompt handling, offering a robust solution for detailed and accurate text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M is a unified benchmark for fish detection, harmonizing 13 datasets with COCO-style annotations. It evaluates 28 models, introduces a CLIP-based selection framework, and provides tools for underwater computer vision research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols in fish detection for ecological monitoring and aquaculture.

Method: Creation of FishDet-M with COCO-style annotations, benchmarking 28 models (YOLO, R-CNN, DETR), and a CLIP-based model selection framework.

Result: Varied detection performance across models, trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and high performance of the CLIP-based selection strategy.

Conclusion: FishDet-M offers a standardized, reproducible platform for underwater object detection, supporting future research with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Generative AI (LightningDiT) to assess fairness in melanoma classifiers, highlighting challenges with dataset alignment but advocating synthetic data for fairness evaluation in medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in melanoma classifiers by ensuring fairness across diverse groups (sex, age, race) using synthetic data.

Method: Leverages the LightningDiT model to generate realistic synthetic data for fairness assessment of melanoma classifiers.

Result: Fairness assessment is promising with synthetic data but challenging if evaluation and training datasets differ.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers a valuable approach for improving fairness in medical-imaging AI systems, despite alignment challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restormer uses channel-wise self-attention for image restoration but may miss localized artifacts. DiNAT-IR introduces Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) with a channel-aware module to balance global and local context, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of Restormer's channel-wise self-attention, which overlooks localized artifacts, by exploring a global-local balance for high-quality image restoration.

Method: Proposes DiNAT-IR, integrating Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) with a channel-aware module to combine global context and local precision.

Result: DiNAT-IR achieves competitive results on multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for image restoration.

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR effectively balances global and local context, addressing Restormer's limitations and improving image restoration performance.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module to improve UDA-SS by balancing local and global details, enhancing segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods struggle with balancing fine-grained local details and global contextual information, leading to segmentation errors.

Method: AFR refines high-resolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits, integrates high-frequency components, and uses uncertainty-driven attention.

Result: AFR improves UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V→Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia→Cityscapes.

Conclusion: AFR enhances segmentation accuracy and is lightweight, making it a valuable addition to HRDA-based UDA methods.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPEN, a dataset for AI-driven engagement recognition in older adults during virtual group learning, addressing gaps in existing research and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate engagement measurement in virtual group settings, especially for older adults, is challenging but crucial for satisfaction and performance. Existing methods lack contextual relevance and longitudinal focus.

Method: The OPEN dataset was collected from 11 older adults in weekly virtual cardiac rehabilitation sessions over six weeks, providing facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and behavioral features.

Result: Machine learning models trained on OPEN achieved up to 81% accuracy in engagement recognition.

Conclusion: OPEN supports scalable, personalized engagement modeling for aging populations and advances broader engagement recognition research.

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated system using YOLO models for real-time video analysis of bearded dragon behaviors (basking and hunting) was developed, with YOLOv8s showing the best performance. Basking detection was reliable, but hunting detection needs improvement due to weak cricket detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon behavior is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Five YOLO variants were trained on a custom dataset (1200 images). YOLOv8s was selected for its accuracy and speed. The system processes video footage with object detection, temporal interpolation, and rule-based behavior classification.

Result: YOLOv8s achieved high accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855). Basking detection was reliable, but hunting detection was less accurate (mAP@0.5 = 0.392 for crickets).

Conclusion: The system improves reptile behavior monitoring efficiency and data quality, though future work should enhance cricket detection for better hunting behavior accuracy.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on ground-level perspectives, which suffer from occlusions and limited coverage. Aerial perspectives can solve these issues, but no dataset exists for this context.

Method: The authors introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, a dataset with 1,837 identities across 4,861 tracklets, and propose TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture for style-robust feature learning, cross-view adaptation, and temporal modeling.

Result: AG-VPReID.VIR presents unique challenges, and TCC-VPReID achieves significant performance gains across evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework address limitations of ground-based systems, offering a robust solution for aerial-ground cross-modality person Re-ID.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how label bias in medical imaging datasets affects deep learning models, focusing on subgroup size and separability, and its impact on feature representations and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied issue of label bias in medical AI systems and its fairness implications for specific subgroups.

Method: Trained deep learning models for binary tissue density classification using the EMBED dataset, simulating label bias in separable and non-separable subgroups.

Result: Label bias caused shifts in feature representations, influenced by subgroup size and separability. Performance varied based on validation set label quality.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of label bias on subgroup fairness in medical AI, emphasizing the need for careful validation set design.

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean

*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimizable cost function for measuring distances between Grassmannian features, enabling improved registration in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack an explicit, optimizable distance function for Grassmannian features, limiting their use in registration problems.

Method: Derives an optimizable cost function using bases of high-dimensional subspaces and extends it to a BnB solver for registration.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing solutions in convergence and performance for computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a globally optimal solution for Grassmannian feature registration, with practical applications and open-source code.

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRR-CoCa enhances the CoCa model with LLM-inspired architectural improvements, outperforming the baseline in pretraining and fine-tuning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lag behind LLMs in architectural sophistication, limiting their performance.

Method: Incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into CoCa's decoders and ViT encoder.

Result: GRR-CoCa outperforms Baseline CoCa by significant margins in pretraining (e.g., 27.25% better contrastive loss) and fine-tuning (e.g., 13.66% better contrastive loss).

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa's architecture improves performance and generalization in vision-language tasks, bridging the gap with LLMs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Celeb-DF++, a large-scale DeepFake dataset with diverse forgery types to address the challenge of generalizable forensics. It evaluates 24 detection methods, revealing their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for generalizable DeepFake detection due to the increasing diversity of DeepFake videos online, which existing datasets fail to cover adequately.

Method: Creation of Celeb-DF++, a dataset with three forgery scenarios (Face-swap, Face-reenactment, Talking-face) using 22 DeepFake methods, and evaluation of 24 detection methods.

Result: The dataset highlights the limitations of current detection methods in handling diverse DeepFake types.

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++ serves as a challenging benchmark for advancing generalizable DeepFake forensics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian inpainting framework improves 3D scene reconstruction by refining masks and optimizing region-wise uncertainty, outperforming existing methods in quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting 3D scenes is challenging due to irregular structures and multi-view consistency needs.

Method: Uses automatic Mask Refinement Process and Uncertainty-guided Optimization, refining masks and optimizing region importance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and view consistency on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses 3D inpainting challenges, enhancing fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

TL;DR: A survey on skeleton-based emotion recognition, covering psychological models, datasets, methods (posture/gait-based), technical paradigms (Traditional, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, End2EndNet), applications in mental health, and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition via body movements is privacy-preserving and enhanced by 3D skeleton technologies, offering an alternative to facial/physiological methods.

Method: Reviews psychological models, datasets, and categorizes methods into posture/gait-based approaches. Introduces a taxonomy of four technical paradigms.

Result: Benchmarking results across datasets and exploration of mental health applications like depression and autism detection.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges and future directions in skeleton-based emotion recognition.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViGText integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations in a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection, outperforming traditional methods in generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of sophisticated deepfakes challenges traditional detection methods, which lack generalization and robustness against attacks.

Method: ViGText divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-level feature extraction.

Result: ViGText achieves significant improvements: F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% in generalization and an 11.1% recall increase in robustness.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new standard for deepfake detection by combining detailed visual and textual analysis, ensuring media authenticity.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset to improve AI-generated video models' ability to handle multi-scene transitions, addressing limitations in current text-to-video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated video models perform well for single-scene clips but struggle with longer videos requiring coherent scene transitions due to lack of training data for multi-scene prompts.

Method: The authors propose the TAV dataset, consisting of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions, and demonstrate its effectiveness through post-training experiments.

Result: Post-training on TAV improves scene transition understanding, reduces the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: The TAV dataset enhances multi-scene video generation by addressing the lack of scene transition awareness in current models.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BokehDiff is a new lens blur rendering method using generative diffusion prior for accurate, artifact-free results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods suffer from depth estimation inaccuracies, causing artifacts. BokehDiff aims to overcome this.

Method: Uses a physics-inspired self-attention module, depth-dependent constraints, and a one-step diffusion model.

Result: Achieves high-quality, artifact-free blur rendering with fidelity.

Conclusion: BokehDiff effectively addresses depth discontinuities and lacks scalable data by leveraging diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-IMI leverages vision-language models and iterative manual instructions for low-light image enhancement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLIE methods lack semantic guidance from normal-light images, limiting their effectiveness in complex lighting.

Method: Uses VLMs with textual descriptions and an instruction prior fusion module to align and fuse image-text features. Iterative manual instructions refine outputs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: VLM-IMI effectively integrates semantic guidance for superior low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextSAM-EUS is a text-driven adaptation of SAM for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, outperforming SOTA models with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in EUS segmentation (speckle noise, low contrast) and reliance on large annotated datasets motivate a lightweight, prompt-free solution.

Method: Uses BiomedCLIP text encoder and LoRA-based SAM adaptation for text-driven segmentation, tuning only 0.86% of parameters.

Result: Achieves 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD with automatic prompts, surpassing SOTA models.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS offers efficient, robust EUS segmentation, pioneering prompt learning in SAM-based medical imaging.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: Demonstrates significant land use changes in Hyderabad, such as urban sprawl and shrinking green spaces, validating the techniques' utility.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are effective for LULC mapping, aiding urban planners and policymakers in managing land use changes.

Abstract: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping is essential for urban and resource
planning, and is one of the key elements in developing smart and sustainable
cities.This study evaluates advanced LULC mapping techniques, focusing on
Look-Up Table (LUT)-based Atmospheric Correction applied to Cartosat
Multispectral (MX) sensor images, followed by supervised and semi-supervised
learning models for LULC prediction. We explore DeeplabV3+ and Cross-Pseudo

enhancing pseudo-label reliability during training. This comprehensive approach
analyses the accuracy and utility of LULC mapping techniques for various urban
planning applications. A case study of Hyderabad, India, illustrates
significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat
MX images over time, we highlight shifts such as urban sprawl, shrinking green
spaces, and expanding industrial areas. This demonstrates the practical utility
of these techniques for urban planners and policymakers.

TL;DR: A two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning improves video temporal grounding by enhancing accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video temporal grounding methods lack temporal awareness and generalization, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: The framework uses high-quality cold start data for supervised fine-tuning, followed by difficulty-controlled reinforcement learning to refine temporal localization.

Result: The method outperforms existing models on multiple benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: High-quality cold start data and difficulty-controlled RL are crucial for improving video temporal grounding, with resources released for further research.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Transformer model predicts fMRI responses to multimodal movies using visual, auditory, and language inputs, leveraging pretrained models and dual cross-attention mechanisms for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop encoding models for predicting whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal stimuli, addressing the need for temporally-aware and multimodal approaches.

Method: A sequence-to-sequence Transformer autoregressively predicts fMRI activity, integrating prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual cross-attention. Uses pretrained models (VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, BridgeTower) for feature extraction.

Result: The model performs well on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, showing effectiveness in capturing long-range temporal structure and individual variability.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain activity prediction, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

*JinYoung Kim,DaeUng Jo,Kimin Yun,Jeonghyo Song,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a framework for joint modeling of distributional uncertainty and OoD detection using free energy, improving upon conventional methods like MC Dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional uncertainty estimation methods like MC Dropout focus narrowly on model or data uncertainty, lacking semantic alignment with OoD detection goals.

Method: Proposes a free-energy-based density estimator (Beta distribution) and integrates it into a posterior network for direct uncertainty estimation, combined with the RPL framework.

Result: The method achieves fine-grained uncertainty estimation and learns OoD regions efficiently, validated on benchmarks like Fishyscapes and RoadAnomaly.

Conclusion: The Free-Energy Posterior Network offers a semantically meaningful and computationally efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

TL;DR: T2VWorldBench is introduced as the first framework to evaluate text-to-video models' ability to generate semantically and factually accurate content using world knowledge. It covers 6 categories and 1,200 prompts, combining human and automated evaluation. Results show current models struggle with world knowledge, highlighting a research gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of study on text-to-video models' ability to leverage world knowledge for semantic and factual accuracy motivates the creation of T2VWorldBench.

Method: The benchmark evaluates 10 advanced models using 6 major categories, 60 subcategories, and 1,200 prompts. It employs human evaluation and automated vision-language models (VLMs).

Result: Most models fail to generate correct videos due to poor understanding of world knowledge.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a critical gap in current models, suggesting opportunities for improving commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

*Kesheng Wang,Xiaoyu Chen,Chunlei He,Fenfen Li,Xinxin Yu,Dexing Kong,Shoujun Huang,Qi Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel entropy-based framework for quantifying curve tortuosity in medical images, validated through meibomian gland atrophy analysis, shows high clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise tortuosity quantification is crucial for medical diagnostics, but traditional methods lack robustness when biologically plausible reference curves are available.

Method: The framework integrates probability modeling, entropy theory, and domain transformation, comparing target curves to reference curves instead of idealized straight lines.

Result: Significant differences in tortuosity-based uniformity were found between patient groups, with high AUC (0.8768), sensitivity (0.75), and specificity (0.93).

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for medical curve tortuosity analysis and has potential as a generalizable tool for quantitative morphological evaluation.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

### [77] [Degradation-Consistent Learning via Bidirectional Diffusion for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18144)
*Jinhong He,Minglong Xue,Zhipu Liu,Mingliang Zhou,Aoxiang Ning,Palaiahnakote Shivakumara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism for low-light image enhancement, improving degradation modeling and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with real-world degradation complexity, leading to structural and pixel inconsistencies.

Method: A bidirectional diffusion approach (low-to-normal and normal-to-low light) with adaptive feature interaction (AFI) and reflection-aware correction (RACM) is introduced.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, generalizing well to diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional diffusion and modules enhance image quality and alignment with human visual perception.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMamba is a cross-modality fusion method for RGB and IR imagery, using DWT and IDWT for improved object detection, achieving a 4.5% mAP boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object detection by leveraging complementary RGB and IR features through frequency-based fusion.

Method: Uses DWT for feature decomposition, WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB) for fusion, and IDWT for reconstruction. Includes Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB) and high-frequency enhancement.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art with 4.5% average mAP improvement on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: WaveMamba effectively integrates RGB and IR features, enhancing detection performance.

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

processing speed of 9 frames per second (FPS). These findings highlight the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling real-time,
resource-efficient object detection and classification for edge computing

*Abhishek Kaushik,Norbert Haala,Uwe Soergel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage UDA framework improves 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation by combining contrastive pre-training and ensemble pseudo-labeling, outperforming direct transfer and single-model UDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, location) is a critical issue, but manual annotation of target data is impractical.

Method: 1. Unsupervised contrastive learning pre-trains a backbone network for domain-invariant features. 2. Multi-model pseudo-labeling via ensemble of diverse architectures (projection, voxel, hybrid, cylinder) refines pseudo-labels via hard voting. The pre-trained network is fine-tuned with these labels.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements when adapting from SemanticKITTI to SemanticPOSS and SemanticSlamantic, surpassing direct transfer and single-model UDA.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges domain gaps without target annotations by combining contrastive pre-training and refined ensemble pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

*Dhruv Jain,Romain Modzelewski,Romain Hérault,Clement Chatelain,Eva Torfeh,Sebastien Thureau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba, a UNet-mamba hybrid with a Noise Reduction Module, improves medical image segmentation by filtering noise and enhancing task-relevant features, showing 1-5% gains over baselines in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in data-scarce medical image segmentation often overfit to noise, limiting generalization.

Method: Combines UNet with mamba for long-range dependencies and introduces a Noise Reduction Module (NRM) to suppress irrelevant activations.

Result: Achieves 1-3% improvement on public datasets (MSD, AIIB23) and 4-5% on NSCLC CBCT segmentation.

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba enhances segmentation accuracy and robustness, especially in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Phan Nguyen Duc Hieu,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL is a self-supervised learning architecture for micrograph analysis, outperforming supervised methods and other SSL approaches with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods for micrograph analysis require retraining for new datasets and perform poorly with limited labels. SSL alternatives often need large datasets. MatSSL addresses these gaps.

Method: MatSSL uses Gated Feature Fusion for multi-level representation integration, pretrains on small unlabeled data, and fine-tunes on benchmarks.

Result: Achieves 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM (vs. 66.73% ImageNet-pretrained) and up to 40% improvement on EBC dataset.

Conclusion: MatSSL adapts effectively to metallography with minimal unlabeled data while retaining transferable features from large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Xiaohao Chen,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeEFusion is a distillation method that improves text-to-image synthesis efficiency by fusing text embeddings and simplifying sampling, achieving 6x faster inference without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs in text-to-image synthesis due to complex sampling and classifier-free guidance (CFG) motivate the need for a more efficient method.

Method: TeEFusion fuses conditional and unconditional text embeddings linearly, distilling the teacher model's sampling strategy into a simpler student model.

Result: The student model achieves 6x faster inference speeds while maintaining image quality comparable to the teacher model.

Conclusion: TeEFusion offers a practical solution to reduce inference costs in text-to-image synthesis without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

*Qilin Huang,Tianyu Lin,Zhiguang Chen,Fudan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF improves medical image segmentation by adapting latent diffusion models, replacing noise prediction with direct segmentation map prediction and using feature distillation for better feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models lack task-specific adjustments for segmentation and have feature extraction deficiencies.

Method: Proposes LEAF, replacing noise prediction with direct segmentation map prediction and using feature distillation to align features.

Result: Enhances performance across multiple segmentation datasets without altering model architecture or increasing computational cost.

Conclusion: LEAF is an efficient and effective method for medical image segmentation, improving upon existing diffusion models.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

*Xin Wei,Qin Yang,Yijie Fang,Mingrui Zhu,Nannan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSDTTA is a novel test-time adaptation method for 3D point clouds, leveraging graph spectral domain for efficient adaptation with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D TTA methods are computationally expensive and may need extra training data, hindering their application to irregular point clouds.

Method: GSDTTA represents point clouds as graphs, transforms them into the spectral domain via GFT, optimizes low-frequency components, and uses IGFT for reconstruction. Self-training refines adjustments.

Result: GSDTTA outperforms existing TTA methods in 3D point cloud classification, as shown by experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Shifting adaptation to the graph spectral domain enables efficient and effective 3D point cloud classification with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network to address domain gaps and temporal misalignment in feature-level fusion for collaborative perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature-level fusion in collaborative perception is hindered by domain gaps from hardware diversity and temporal misalignment from delays, degrading feature quality.

Method: Proposes CDAM for domain alignment, PTAM for temporal alignment, and IFAM for feature aggregation.

Result: DATA achieves top performance on three datasets, robust to delays and pose errors.

Conclusion: The DATA network effectively aligns features and enhances semantic representations for improved collaborative perception.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

TL;DR: DepthDark is a robust foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation, addressing dataset and fine-tuning challenges with flare/noise simulation and PEFT strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monocular depth estimation models perform poorly in low-light due to lack of datasets and effective fine-tuning methods.

Method: Uses flare-simulation and noise-simulation modules to create datasets, and a PEFT strategy with illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets with limited resources.

Conclusion: DepthDark effectively addresses low-light depth estimation challenges, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

TL;DR: LONG3R is a novel model for real-time, long-sequence multi-view 3D scene reconstruction, using memory gating and a dual-source decoder for efficient processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view scene reconstruction struggle with real-time processing of long sequences due to offline optimization or sequence length limitations.

Method: LONG3R employs a memory gating mechanism, a dual-source refined decoder, and a 3D spatio-temporal memory for dynamic pruning and resolution adjustment. It uses a two-stage curriculum training strategy.

Result: LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, especially for long sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed.

Conclusion: LONG3R advances real-time, long-sequence 3D reconstruction with efficient memory management and training strategies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning to improve infrared small target detection (ISTD) under data scarcity, using Gaussian Group Squeezer and two-stage diffusion models for better resilience and sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISTD methods rely on expensive manual-labeling data, making them fragile in real-world scenarios. The study aims to address performance variations under data scarcity.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Group Squeezer for non-uniform quantization and two-stage diffusion models for real-world reconstruction to enhance ISTD model resilience.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scarcity scenarios, improving detection quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses ISTD challenges under data scarcity, offering robust and high-quality detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

*Wenran Zhang,Huihuan Luo,Linda Wei,Ping Nie,Yiqun Wu,Dedong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses Mendelian randomization to show a causal link between dental caries and lung cancer, mediated by lung function decline, but finds no such link for periodontitis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the uncertain causal relationships between oral diseases (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer, and assess mediation by pulmonary function.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using genetic instruments from large genome-wide association studies, with inverse variance weighting and mediation analysis via the delta method.

Result: Dental caries significantly increases lung cancer risk (especially squamous cell carcinoma), partially mediated by declines in FVC and FEV1. No causal effect found for periodontitis.

Conclusion: Dental caries causally contributes to lung cancer risk, suggesting the need for integrated dental care and lung function monitoring in prevention strategies.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

*Jincheng Li,Chunyu Xie,Ji Ao,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMM-Det is a simple approach using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for object detection without specialized modules, improving recall via data distribution adjustment and inference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs show gaps in object detection compared to specialist detectors, prompting a need for a simpler, effective solution.

Method: Proposes LMM-Det, leveraging LMMs for detection by adjusting data distribution and optimizing inference, without extra modules.

Result: Experiments confirm LMM-Det's effectiveness, showing LMMs can detect objects without specialized modules.

Conclusion: LMM-Det bridges the gap between LMMs and specialist detectors, proving LMMs' inherent detection capability.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

*Xiaomei Zhang,Hanyu Zheng,Xiangyu Zhu,Jinghuan Wei,Junhong Zou,Zhen Lei,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FieldLVLM enhances large vision-language models for scientific field data interpretation using field-aware language generation and data-compressed tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs lack effectiveness in scientific domains, particularly for complex field data.

Method: FieldLVLM combines field-aware language generation (extracting key features into structured text) and data-compressed multimodal tuning (simplifying inputs for LVLMs).

Result: Outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets for scientific field data tasks.

Conclusion: FieldLVLM bridges the gap between LVLMs and domain-specific scientific research.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

*Minje Park,Jeonghwa Lim,Taehyung Yu,Sunghoon Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for semi-supervised ECG delineation was created, comparing transformer and convolutional networks, with transformers showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated ECG datasets limits deep learning progress, prompting the use of semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data.

Method: Curated public datasets, implemented five SemiSeg algorithms on convolutional and transformer architectures, and evaluated in in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Result: Transformers outperformed convolutional networks in semi-supervised ECG delineation.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation and encourages further research.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Modified Nuclear Norm (MNN) framework is introduced for matrix recovery, capturing both local and global low-rank structures without parameter tuning, with proven theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing methods by jointly capturing local and global low-rank structures in matrix recovery tasks like Robust PCA and matrix completion.

Method: Defines MNN by applying transformations to the matrix and performing nuclear norm on the transformed matrix, ensuring flexibility and theoretical guarantees.

Result: MNN provides exact recovery guarantees under mild assumptions and outperforms existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MNN offers a unified, effective approach for structured low-rank recovery, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Franck Ballerini,Stephania-Denisa Bocu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GVCCS, a dataset of contrails tracked via ground cameras, and a deep learning framework for contrail analysis to improve climate impact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrails significantly impact aviation's climate effects, but existing models lack accurate data for validation. Observational datasets are limited in tracking and attributing contrails to flights.

Method: The authors present GVCCS, a dataset of contrails recorded with ground cameras, labeled and tracked. They also propose a deep learning framework for contrail segmentation and tracking.

Result: The dataset includes 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) with flight identifiers. A unified deep learning model performs semantic and instance segmentation with temporal tracking.

Conclusion: GVCCS and the proposed framework enhance contrail monitoring and model calibration, improving climate impact assessments.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

TL;DR: SGCDet is a multi-view 3D object detection framework using adaptive 3D volume construction, improving feature representation and efficiency by dynamically adjusting view contributions and minimizing redundant computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods limit voxel receptive fields to fixed image locations, lacking adaptability in integrating geometric and contextual information.

Method: Introduces a geometry and context aware aggregation module for dynamic view contribution adjustment and a sparse volume construction strategy for efficient feature refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ARKitScenes datasets.

Conclusion: SGCDet offers an adaptive, efficient solution for 3D object detection, reducing reliance on ground-truth geometry.

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

### [97] [Improving Bird Classification with Primary Color Additives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18334)
*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to classify bird species using song recordings by embedding frequency information into spectrograms with color additives, improving accuracy over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in classifying bird species from noisy or overlapping song recordings, where current models fail due to low signal-to-noise ratios and similar motifs across species.

Method: The authors visualize bird songs using pitch, speed, and repetition (motifs) and enhance spectrograms by embedding frequency information with primary color additives to improve species distinction.

Result: The approach outperforms existing models, including the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, with significant improvements in F1 (7.3%), ROC-AUC (6.2%), and CMAP (6.6%).

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency information via colorization effectively enhances bird species classification from song recordings.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoExoBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on cross-view reasoning between egocentric and exocentric perspectives, revealing their limitations in semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human intelligence excels at transferring knowledge between first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric) viewpoints, but this ability is unexplored in MLLMs.

Method: The authors introduce EgoExoBench, a benchmark with over 7,300 question-answer pairs across 11 sub-tasks, evaluating 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs perform well on single-view tasks but struggle with cross-view reasoning, including semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: EgoExoBench aims to advance research on embodied agents and intelligent assistants by addressing human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices in bias mitigation research.

Method: Introduces VB-Mitigator, a unified framework with 12 mitigation methods, 7 datasets, and extensible features.

Result: Provides a standardized platform for fair comparison and reproducibility of bias mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: VB-Mitigator accelerates fairness-aware computer vision research by offering a foundational, extensible codebase.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

*Lexuan Zhu,Yuxuan Li,Yuning Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deformable convolutional module using attention and feedforward networks improves global feature capture and achieves state-of-the-art performance in fundus blood vessel segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complex shape features in tasks like fundus blood vessel segmentation, which require capturing long-distance global features.

Method: Proposes a plug-and-play deformable convolutional module that learns sub-pixel displacement fields and warps feature maps across channels, decoupling kernel size from the learning network.

Result: GDCUnet, a model using this module, achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets and better learns complex features.

Conclusion: The module enhances model representation and generalization, suggesting broader application in machine vision tasks with complex global features.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

TL;DR: MVG4D is a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally consistent 4D content from a single image using multi-view synthesis and 4D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-quality dynamic 4D content remains challenging due to motion discontinuity and background degradation in existing methods.

Method: MVG4D combines multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting, using an image matrix module for coherent multi-view images and a deformation network for temporal extension.

Result: MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like CLIP-I, PSNR, and FVD, reducing flickering and enhancing details.

Conclusion: MVG4D advances efficient and controllable 4D generation, improving AR/VR experiences.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration for physical task completion has significant
potential in both everyday activities and professional domains. AI agents
equipped with informative guidance can enhance human performance, but
evaluating such collaboration remains challenging due to the complexity of

*Yayuan Li,Filippos Bellos,Jason Corso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A one-stage architecture for direct pose generation from minimal context (RGB image + text) outperforms existing methods by avoiding intermediate representations and maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose generation methods degrade in long-term scenarios due to reliance on intermediate representations or autoregressive models, which introduce errors.

Method: Proposes a one-stage model that directly generates poses in continuous space using relative movement prediction and unified placeholder tokens, ensuring consistent training and inference behavior.

Result: Outperforms quantization-based and autoregressive methods on Penn Action and F-PHAB datasets, especially in long-term generation.

Conclusion: The novel one-stage approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved performance and coherence in pose generation.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenHumanBRDF, a high-quality dataset for full-body human inverse rendering, and proposes HumanMaterial, a model with progressive training and CPR loss to improve material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for full-body human inverse rendering lack realism, especially for skin, due to simplified material data and rendering equations. The absence of constraints on material maps makes the task ill-posed.

Method: The authors construct OpenHumanBRDF, a dataset with high-quality materials (e.g., displacement, subsurface scattering). They design HumanMaterial, a model with progressive training and CPR loss to balance material map importance.

Result: Experiments on OpenHumanBRDF and real data show state-of-the-art performance in material estimation and rendering realism.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model significantly improve the realism of full-body human inverse rendering, particularly for skin, by addressing material constraints and training challenges.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer is a competitive alternative to Swin Transformer, with potential to inspire future research in video generation and other domains.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and

*Xun Ye,Ruixiang Tang,Mingda Zhang,Jianglong Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFFSNet introduces a feature space decoupling strategy to dynamically balance connectivity and other features, outperforming existing models in medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep networks integrating connectivity lack standardized mechanisms to quantify feature strengths, leading to coupled feature spaces.

Method: Proposes DCFFSNet with a feature space decoupling strategy and a fusion-separation architecture for dynamic multi-scale feature balancing.

Result: Outperforms top models on ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets, improving Dice and IoU metrics.

Conclusion: DCFFSNet resolves segmentation fragmentation, enhances edge transitions, and improves clinical usability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using V-JEPA, a self-supervised learning framework, for ultrasound video segmentation, enhanced by a novel 3D localization task to improve ViT performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in acquiring and annotating ultrasound datasets due to noise and artifacts motivate the use of SSL to leverage unlabeled data for better segmentation with limited annotations.

Method: Adopts V-JEPA for ultrasound video data, introduces a 3D localization auxiliary task to enhance ViT locality, and evaluates segmentation performance with varying training data.

Result: V-JEPA with the auxiliary task improves segmentation, achieving gains of 3.4% with 100% and 8.35% with 10% of training data.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates V-JEPA's suitability for ultrasound imaging and the effectiveness of the proposed 3D localization task in improving segmentation performance.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

### [108] [NLML-HPE: Head Pose Estimation with Limited Data via Manifold Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18429)
*Mahdi Ghafourian,Federico M. Sukno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning method, NLML-HPE, uses tensor decomposition and neural networks for head pose estimation with limited data, addressing annotation issues and achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head pose estimation is vital for applications like human-computer interaction, but existing datasets often have inaccurate annotations, and traditional methods struggle with limited data.

Method: Combines tensor decomposition (Tucker) and neural networks to model pose angles as regression, using cosine curves for manifold learning. A precise 2D dataset was generated from 3D models.

Result: Achieves real-time performance and accurate pose estimation with limited training data by capturing rotation nature from facial landmarks.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE is effective for head pose estimation with limited data, offering fast predictions and addressing annotation challenges.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

### [109] [SynC: Synthetic Image Caption Dataset Refinement with One-to-many Mapping for Zero-shot Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18616)
*Si-Woo Kim,MinJu Jeon,Ye-Chan Kim,Soeun Lee,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynC is a framework for refining synthetic image-caption datasets in Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) by reassigning captions to semantically aligned images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset pruning techniques are unsuitable for synthetic data, where captions are well-formed but images may misalign. SynC addresses this gap.

Method: SynC uses a one-to-many mapping strategy and a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer to reassign captions to the best-matched images.

Result: SynC significantly improves ZIC model performance on benchmarks like MS-COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SynC provides an effective solution for refining synthetic data to enhance ZIC, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

### [110] [DSFormer: A Dual-Scale Cross-Learning Transformer for Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18444)
*Haiyang Jiang,Songhao Piao,Chao Gao,Lei Yu,Liguo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining Dual-Scale-Former (DSFormer) and block clustering improves Visual Place Recognition (VPR) by enhancing feature representation and optimizing data organization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in VPR under varying conditions and viewpoints to improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: Integrates DSFormer for bidirectional feature transfer and block clustering to optimize dataset partitioning.

Result: Achieves top performance on benchmarks, reduces training data by 30%, and improves computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust and efficient solution for VPR, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

### [111] [PDB-Eval: An Evaluation of Large Multimodal Models for Description and Explanation of Personalized Driving Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18447)
*Junda Wu,Jessica Echterhoff,Kyungtae Han,Amr Abdelraouf,Rohit Gupta,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB-Eval, a benchmark for understanding driver behavior using Large Multimodal Models (MLLMs), improving zero-shot performance by up to 73.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack detailed explanations of driver behavior from external visual evidence, limiting the effectiveness of driver assistance systems.

Method: The benchmark includes PDB-X for evaluating MLLMs' understanding of driving scenes and PDB-QA for fine-tuning MLLMs with visual explanations.

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs on PDB-Eval improves zero-shot QA performance by 73.2% and enhances intention prediction tasks by up to 12.5%.

Conclusion: PDB-Eval effectively bridges the gap between MLLMs and driving tasks, enhancing both comprehension and reasoning in driver behavior analysis.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

TL;DR: A standardized framework for physical adversarial object attacks in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, enabling fair comparisons and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of physical realizability and reproducibility in adversarial attacks on LiDAR systems.

Method: Proposes a device-agnostic framework with open-source code and benchmarking protocols for simulation and real-world validation.

Result: Successfully transfers simulated attacks to physical LiDAR systems and provides insights into attack success factors.

Conclusion: The framework accelerates research and enhances understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

TL;DR: CRUISE is a framework for reconstructing and augmenting V2X driving scenes using decomposed Gaussian Splatting, improving 3D detection and generating corner cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of simulation for data generation in V2X scenarios is underexplored, despite its importance for autonomous driving.

Method: CRUISE uses decomposed Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct real-world scenes and allows flexible editing of dynamic traffic participants. It renders images from multiple views for dataset augmentation.

Result: CRUISE achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, improves 3D detection and tracking, and generates challenging corner cases.

Conclusion: CRUISE effectively enhances V2X data generation and augmentation, benefiting autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

TL;DR: Proposes Q-Former Autoencoder for unsupervised medical anomaly detection using pretrained vision models, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in medical anomaly detection due to diverse anomalies and lack of annotated data.

Method: Leverages frozen pretrained vision models (DINO, DINOv2, Masked Autoencoder) with Q-Former bottleneck and perceptual loss.

Result: Achieves top performance on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates pretrained vision models' generalization to medical tasks without fine-tuning; code and models released.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

TL;DR: The paper presents an enhanced NIH malaria dataset with detailed COCO-format annotations for object detection in malaria diagnosis, validated using Faster R-CNN with high F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate malaria diagnosis in developing countries requires reliable detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood smears, but limited annotated datasets hinder deep learning adoption.

Method: The authors improved the NIH malaria dataset with detailed bounding box annotations, trained a Faster R-CNN model, and validated it via cross-validation.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.88 for infected cell detection, highlighting the importance of annotation quality.

Conclusion: Automated annotation refinement and manual correction can produce high-quality training data, as demonstrated by the publicly available updated dataset.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

*Xiao Yang,Lingxuan Wu,Lizhong Wang,Chengyang Ying,Hang Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein-EAD is a proactive defense framework for 3D adversarial attacks, using adaptive exploration and interaction to improve robustness in dynamic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses rely on passive strategies and pre-defined assumptions, limiting adaptability in 3D adversarial contexts.

Method: Rein-EAD employs a multi-step objective balancing accuracy and entropy minimization, with an uncertainty-oriented reward mechanism for efficient policy updates.

Result: Rein-EAD reduces attack success rates significantly while maintaining standard accuracy and generalizing to unseen attacks.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD is effective for real-world 3D tasks like object classification, face recognition, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve mapless autonomous driving by integrating map uncertainty into trajectory prediction, focusing on the ego vehicle's kinematic state and introducing a novel gating mechanism and covariance-based uncertainty approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mapless autonomous driving approaches lack reliability in online-generated maps, and existing methods for incorporating map uncertainty into trajectory prediction lack scenario-specific insights.

Method: The authors analyze scenarios where map uncertainty benefits trajectory prediction, identify the ego vehicle's kinematic state as a key factor, and propose Proprioceptive Scenario Gating and Covariance-based Map Uncertainty.

Result: The approach achieves a 23.6% improvement in trajectory prediction performance on the nuScenes dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability and outperforming previous integration strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: To improve human-like attention modeling by leveraging top-down cues and foveal vision, inspired by advancements in deep learning and human scanpath data.

Method: SemBA-FAST combines deep object detection with probabilistic semantic fusion, using pre-trained detectors and artificial foveation to dynamically update attention maps.

Result: Outperforms baseline and other top-down models on COCO-Search18, closely matching human scanpaths and competing with scanpath-informed models.

Conclusion: SemBA-FAST demonstrates the potential of semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modeling, with applications in cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Motivation: To enable quantitative comparison of SAE-derived features across different model modalities and understand shared representations between visual, textual, and multimodal encoders.

Method: Proposes a new indicator for cross-modality SAE feature comparison and a metric for feature sharedness. Studies 21 encoders of varying sizes and datasets.

Result: Reveals shared features between visual and text encoders, highlighting text pretraining's impact. Provides insights into multimodal model representations.

Conclusion: The study offers tools for cross-modality SAE feature analysis and demonstrates shared representations, emphasizing the role of text pretraining in feature alignment.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Motivation: Detecting rare objects like bio-digesters in large remote sensing datasets is challenging but crucial for applications like environmental impact assessment.

Method: A part-based approach is developed, focusing on sub-elements of bio-digesters, and applied to new regions for inventory building. Geostatistical estimates of methane production are computed.

Result: The method successfully builds an inventory of bio-digesters and estimates their methane production in specific areas and times.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively tackles the challenge of rare object detection and provides actionable insights for environmental impact studies.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

TL;DR: The paper explores using foundation models for semantic object segmentation in cluttered scenes, focusing on vision-guided neuroprostheses. It introduces gaze-based prompts for SAM and fine-tuning on egocentric data, achieving a 0.51 IoU improvement on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable object segmentation in cluttered, real-world scenes for vision-guided upper limb neuroprostheses without fine-tuning on specific images.

Method: Proposes gaze fixation-based prompts to guide SAM and fine-tunes it on egocentric visual data.

Result: Achieves up to a 0.51-point improvement in IoU segmentation quality on the Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages foundation models for segmentation in challenging real-world scenarios, with significant performance gains.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data
of Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus which is made available on the RoboFlow Platform

TL;DR: GaussianFusionOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction using 3D Gaussians and multi-sensor fusion for better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing autonomous driving by enabling precise and safe navigation through reliable 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Method: Uses semantic 3D Gaussians and modality-agnostic deformable attention for sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, radar).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc offers a scalable, memory-efficient solution for 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: IntentVCNet bridges the spatio-temporal gap in LVLMs for fine-grained intent-oriented video captioning by combining prompt strategies and a box adapter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack fine-grained spatial control in time sequences for intent-oriented video captioning.

Method: Proposes a prompt combination strategy and a parameter-efficient box adapter to enhance spatial detail modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results and runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

Conclusion: IntentVCNet effectively unifies temporal and spatial understanding in LVLMs for accurate intent-oriented captioning.

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

TL;DR: EDA expands diffusion models to arbitrary noise patterns, improving image restoration without extra computational cost, outperforming task-specific methods in MRI, CT, and natural image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed Gaussian noise in EDM limits image restoration by corrupting degraded images and increasing complexity.

Method: EDA introduces arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models, preserving EDM's flexibility while expanding noise pattern freedom.

Result: EDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in MRI bias correction, CT artifact reduction, and shadow removal with just 5 sampling steps.

Conclusion: EDA effectively addresses EDM's limitations, enhancing restoration quality and versatility across diverse noise types.

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

TL;DR: TTS-VAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models, improving efficiency and performance through adaptive batch scheduling, clustering-based diversity search, and resampling-based potential selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of scaling visual generation models, TTS-VAR offers a resource-efficient alternative by optimizing test-time scaling for auto-regressive models.

Method: The framework models generation as path searching, using adaptive batch scheduling, clustering-based diversity search for coarse scales, and resampling-based potential selection for fine scales.

Result: Experiments show an 8.7% improvement in GenEval score (0.69 to 0.75) on the Infinity model, validating the approach.

Conclusion: TTS-VAR effectively balances computational efficiency and exploration, leveraging structural features and resampling to enhance generation quality.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework integrates MVS priors with probabilistic Procrustes mapping, enabling accurate reconstruction from hundreds of unposed outdoor images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS models struggle with memory limits and accuracy in unposed reconstruction tasks for large image sets.

Method: Partitions images into subsets, maps submaps globally using probabilistic Procrustes, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS.

Result: Achieves accurate reconstruction and pose estimation on Waymo and KITTI datasets, setting a new state of the art.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing MVS models, enabling robust unposed 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound to preoperative MRI is challenging due to modality differences.

Method: Patient-specific matching-by-synthesis, probabilistic keypoint detection, and curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining.

Result: Achieves 69.8% average precision in keypoint matching and 2.39 mm mean Target Registration Error.

Conclusion: The method is interpretable, robust, and requires no manual initialization, advancing MRI-iUS registration.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Motivation: To address the lack of datasets providing deep-cognitive expressions (e.g., intent) and enhance multi-modal feature representation for video content cognition.

Method: The dataset includes 103K videos with audio and hierarchical textual descriptions (factual, abstract, intent). Intent expressions are generated via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. A gold-standard benchmark of 3K samples is manually validated.

Result: Evaluation of models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) is conducted using hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments with multi-level metrics.

Conclusion: VideoMind advances deep video understanding and cross-modal alignment, serving as a benchmark for tasks like emotion and intent recognition. The dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic, labeled images of chicken carcasses and a benchmark dataset to improve instance segmentation in poultry processing. Synthetic data significantly enhances segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of chicken carcasses is crucial for quality control and efficiency, but real-world data acquisition and annotation are labor-intensive.

Method: Developed a pipeline for synthetic image generation and automatic labeling, and evaluated synthetic data's impact on instance segmentation models.

Result: Synthetic data boosts segmentation performance across models, demonstrating its value in addressing data scarcity.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation is effective for improving AI-driven detection systems in poultry processing, reducing manual effort.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Motivation: Enhancing targeted advertising by improving simultaneous age and gender classification from facial images.

Method: Custom CNN architecture trained on a diverse dataset, optimized for shared representations between age and gender.

Result: 95% gender classification accuracy and 5.77 MAE for age estimation, with challenges in younger age groups.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement, offering insights for future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for demorphing face images that overcomes limitations of existing techniques by decomposing morphs in latent space, enabling detection of unseen morph techniques and styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demorphing methods struggle with morph replication and assume identical morph techniques for training and testing, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed method decomposes morphs in latent space, trained on synthetic faces and tested on real faces with arbitrary morph techniques.

Result: Outperforms existing methods significantly, producing high-fidelity demorphed face images.

Conclusion: The method provides robust demorphing for diverse morph techniques and face styles, enhancing morph attack detection.

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

TL;DR: DMDX improves score distillation by combining adversarial pre-training and ADM fine-tuning, outperforming DMD2 in one-step performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mode collapse in DMD by introducing adversarial alignment of latent predictions.

Method: Propose ADM with diffusion-based discriminators and hybrid discriminators for adversarial distillation.

Result: Superior one-step performance on SDXL and benchmarks in image/video synthesis.

Conclusion: DMDX sets a new standard for efficient distillation in generative models.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in 3D segmentation but suffer from quadratic complexity, while Mamba offers linear complexity but struggles with feature representation. Combining these complementary strengths is challenging.

Method: Proposes HybridTM, a hybrid architecture integrating Transformer and Mamba, and the Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy for finer granularity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybridTM effectively combines Transformer and Mamba, demonstrating superior performance and generalization in 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

*Shuqing Li,Anson Y. Lam,Yun Peng,Wenxuan Wang,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scenethesis introduces a requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach, addressing limitations in current 3D software generation by enabling fine-grained control and constraint handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D software generation lacks granular control and struggles with spatial/semantic constraints, limiting adaptability and precision.

Method: Scenethesis uses ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language, to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software, enabling staged synthesis and constraint satisfaction.

Result: Scenethesis captures 80% of user requirements, satisfies 90% of hard constraints, and improves visual evaluation scores by 42.8%.

Conclusion: Scenethesis advances 3D software generation by offering traceability, fine-grained control, and robust constraint handling.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

*Ye-Chan Kim,SeungJu Cha,Si-Woo Kim,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDA introduces a zero-shot domain adaptation method using synthetic images instead of text descriptions to improve efficiency and capture real-world variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven methods for zero-shot domain adaptation struggle with complex variations and slow adaptation times.

Method: SIDA generates synthetic images via source-like images and style translation, then uses Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer modules for adaptation.

Result: SIDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios and reduces adaptation time significantly.

Conclusion: SIDA offers an efficient and effective alternative to text-driven zero-shot domain adaptation, excelling in challenging domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for recognizing artists from text-to-image model outputs is introduced, evaluating various methods across different generalization settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the controversial use of artist names in text-to-image prompts and enable responsible moderation of such models.

Method: The study uses a dataset of 1.95M images from 110 artists, testing feature similarity, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks across four generalization settings.

Result: Supervised and few-shot models perform well on seen artists and complex prompts, while style descriptors excel with pronounced styles. Multi-artist prompts are the most challenging.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights significant room for improvement and aims to advance responsible moderation of text-to-image models. The dataset and benchmark are publicly released for further research.

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

TL;DR: Captain Cinema is a framework for generating short movies from textual descriptions, using top-down keyframe planning and bottom-up video synthesis with Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the creation of visually coherent and narrative-consistent short movies efficiently.

Method: Uses top-down keyframe planning for storyline coherence, followed by bottom-up video synthesis with MM-DiT trained on interleaved cinematic data.

Result: Produces high-quality, narrative-consistent short movies efficiently.

Conclusion: Captain Cinema effectively automates short movie generation with visual and narrative coherence.

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the MediaPipe algorithm for facial landmark detection in surgical settings, showing improved accuracy under controlled lighting and robotic adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like variable lighting and flexible detection positions in medical applications of face detection algorithms.

Method: Testing MediaPipe with a robotic arm in a controlled setting, adjusting positions while keeping surgical light and phantom fixed.

Result: Improved accuracy in facial landmark detection under surgical lighting, especially at larger yaw and pitch angles, though with some dispersion due to imprecise landmark detection.

Conclusion: The study suggests potential for integrating MediaPipe into medical procedures, despite minor limitations in precision.

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

*Chenyu Su,Weiwei Shang,Chen Qian,Fei Zhang,Shuang Cong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReSem3D leverages MLLMs and VFMs to create fine-grained 3D spatial constraints for real-time robotic manipulation, addressing limitations in semantic granularity, planning, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained semantic modeling, real-time planning, and robustness in diverse environments, hindering effective robotic manipulation.

Method: ReSem3D uses hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs and VFMs to dynamically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language and RGB-D data, encoded as real-time optimization objectives.

Result: The framework successfully performs diverse manipulation tasks in zero-shot conditions, showing adaptability and generalization in household and lab environments.

Conclusion: ReSem3D advances robotic manipulation by unifying semantic understanding and execution, demonstrating strong performance in semantically diverse settings.

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaRPG is a framework using foundation models to improve manipulation of articulated objects by focusing on part-level affordances and leveraging common knowledge for adaptive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in manipulating articulated objects due to geometric diversity and functional variations, which hinder generalization.

Method: Proposes AdaRPG, which extracts object parts for better affordance generalization and uses foundation models to reason about mechanisms and generate control codes.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization across novel articulated object categories in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: AdaRPG effectively enhances adaptive manipulation of articulated objects by leveraging part-level affordances and foundation models.

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

TL;DR: An Agentic AI framework automates clinical data pipelines, handling structured and unstructured data for feature extraction, model selection, and preprocessing, reducing manual intervention in healthcare ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and labor-intensive processes in healthcare ML due to fragmented workflows, model compatibility issues, and data privacy constraints.

Method: Modular, task-specific agents automate data ingestion, anonymization, feature extraction, model selection, preprocessing, and inference. Evaluated on geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy datasets.

Result: Automated pipeline reduces expert intervention, offering scalable, cost-efficient AI operationalization in clinical settings.

Conclusion: The framework streamlines ML workflows in healthcare, enhancing efficiency and scalability while maintaining privacy compliance.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing alignment methods (e.g., RLHF) by enabling intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection in AI models.

Method: Uses the SafeLadder framework with progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning and multi-principled verifiers, plus inference-time interventions and deliberative search.

Result: SafeWork-R1 shows a 46.54% average improvement in safety benchmarks over its base model while maintaining general capabilities, surpassing proprietary models.

Conclusion: The SafeLadder framework proves generalizable, enabling coevolution of safety and capability in AI models like SafeWork-R1.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the data used for training probing models affects their performance, as prior work focused less on this aspect.

Method: Investigates concept probing in image classification by analyzing the effect of training data on probing model performance.

Result: Provides insights into the role of training data in concept probing and releases concept labels for two popular datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of training data in concept probing and contributes labeled datasets for future research.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately predict distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli by integrating visual, auditory, and semantic information over time.

Method: Uses modality-specific bidirectional RNNs for temporal encoding, fuses hidden states, and employs lightweight subject-specific heads for output. Training involves a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum strategy.

Result: Achieved an overall Pearson r = 0.2094, with the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) and strong performance on Subject 5.

Conclusion: The model provides a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities or scale poorly with larger sampling budgets.

Method: GenSelect uses long reasoning to select the best solution from N candidates, scaling efficiently with parallel sampling.

Result: GenSelect outperforms existing scoring approaches in math reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GenSelect effectively combines LLMs' comparative strengths with scalable parallel sampling for improved reasoning performance.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large
language models. Unlike previous algorithms that adopt token-level importance
ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3
models.

### [151] [Enhancing Quantization-Aware Training on Edge Devices via Relative Entropy Coreset Selection and Cascaded Layer Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17768)
*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRC is a QAT framework for edge devices that uses coreset selection and cascaded layer correction to reduce quantization errors, improving accuracy with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient low-bit quantized models on edge devices, coupled with privacy concerns, drives the development of a method that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: QuaRC employs Relative Entropy Score for coreset selection and Cascaded Layer Correction to align intermediate layer outputs between quantized and full-precision models.

Result: QuaRC improves Top-1 accuracy by 5.72% on ImageNet-1K with a 1% data subset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: QuaRC effectively addresses quantization errors and computational inefficiencies, making it a viable solution for edge device deployment.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

*Daniel Carlstrom Schad,Shrey Dixit,Janis Keck,Viktor Studenyak,Aleksandr Shpilevoi,Andrej Bicanski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VIBE is a two-stage Transformer model that combines video, audio, and text features to predict fMRI activity, achieving high correlations on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve fMRI activity prediction by leveraging multi-modal features (video, audio, text) using advanced Transformer architectures.

Method: VIBE uses a two-stage Transformer: a modality-fusion transformer to merge features from open-source models (Qwen2.5, BEATs, etc.) and a prediction transformer with rotary embeddings for temporal decoding. It was trained on 65 hours of movie data and ensembled across 20 seeds.

Result: VIBE achieved mean parcel-wise Pearson correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution data (Friends S07) and 21.25 on out-of-distribution films, outperforming earlier iterations.

Conclusion: VIBE demonstrates strong performance in fMRI prediction, winning Phase-1 and placing second overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge, showcasing the effectiveness of multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: We present VIBE, a two-stage Transformer that fuses multi-modal video, audio,
and text features to predict fMRI activity. Representations from open-source
models (Qwen2.5, BEATs, Whisper, SlowFast, V-JEPA) are merged by a
modality-fusion transformer and temporally decoded by a prediction transformer
with rotary embeddings. Trained on 65 hours of movie data from the CNeuroMod
dataset and ensembled across 20 seeds, VIBE attains mean parcel-wise Pearson
correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution Friends S07 and 21.25 on six
out-of-distribution films. An earlier iteration of the same architecture
obtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second
overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

*Jianchao Wang,Qingfeng Li,Pengcheng Zheng,Xiaorong Pu,Yazhou Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChronoSelect is a novel framework for learning with noisy labels, leveraging temporal dynamics and a four-stage memory architecture to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning with noisy labels suffer from static evaluations and fail to utilize temporal learning dynamics, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ChronoSelect introduces a four-stage memory architecture with a sliding update mechanism and controlled decay, enabling temporal trajectory analysis and dual-branch consistency for sample partitioning.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees for convergence and stability.

Conclusion: ChronoSelect effectively addresses noisy label challenges by dynamically leveraging temporal patterns, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) by using LLM-based text embedders, which outperform traditional methods like BM25 and supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient retrieval of legal precedents due to the growing volume of cases, and the limitations of current IR methods in handling lengthy legal texts and lack of training data.

Method: Leveraging LLM-based text embedders to handle longer input lengths and operate unsupervised, eliminating the need for training data.

Result: LLM-based embedders outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models in four PCR benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-based embedders are a promising solution for PCR, addressing key challenges and improving retrieval performance.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR.EHR, a dense retrieval model for EHRs, addressing semantic gaps with a two-stage training pipeline using MIMIC-IV data and biomedical knowledge. It outperforms existing models on the CliniQ benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR retrieval is challenging due to semantic gaps, and existing models lack sufficient medical knowledge or suitable training data.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) medical entity extraction and knowledge injection, (2) training data generation using large language models. Two model variants (110M and 7B parameters) are trained.

Result: DR.EHR achieves state-of-the-art results on CliniQ, excelling in semantic matches like implication and abbreviation. Ablation studies confirm pipeline effectiveness.

Conclusion: DR.EHR advances EHR retrieval, offering a robust solution for clinical applications, with demonstrated generalizability on EHR QA datasets.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The CHiME-7 and 8 challenges advanced multi-channel ASR and diarization, highlighting trends like the shift to end-to-end systems, reliance on guided source separation, and the importance of diarization refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance research in multi-channel, generalizable ASR and diarization by analyzing trends from participant submissions in the CHiME-7 and 8 challenges.

Method: Analyzed 32 diverse systems from 9 teams, focusing on design, metrics, datasets, and baseline systems.

Result: Key findings include the dominance of end-to-end ASR, reliance on guided source separation, and the critical role of diarization refinement.

Conclusion: Despite progress, transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging environments remains difficult, even with advanced techniques.

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models, revealing memorization issues through adversarial phonetic prompting (APT) and uncovering sub-lexical memorization and phonetic-to-visual regurgitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate underexplored vulnerabilities in LS2 models, particularly memorization of training data, and its implications for multimodal generative systems.

Method: Introduces Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT) to alter lyrics semantically while preserving acoustic structure, testing models like SUNO and YuE across languages and genres. Also examines text-to-video models.

Result: Models regenerate training content despite phonetic distortions, showing high similarity in audio metrics. Phoneme-altered lyrics also trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation, raising concerns about copyright, safety, and content provenance.

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

TL;DR: RECALLED is the first method to exploit visual inputs for Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) in large vision-language models (LVLMs), increasing latency and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming studies overlook visual inputs as attack surfaces, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to RCAs.

Method: Uses Vision Guided Optimization for pixel-level adversarial perturbations and Multi-Objective Parallel Losses for universal attack templates.

Result: Increases response latency by over 26x, raising GPU usage and memory consumption by 20%.

Conclusion: Exposes LVLM vulnerabilities and provides a framework for future RCA defenses.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LoRA-Leak reveals that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), leveraging the pre-trained model for enhanced attacks, and suggests defenses like dropout and layer exclusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to MIAs and highlight the overlooked risk of information leakage from pre-trained models.

Method: Introduces LoRA-Leak, a framework with fifteen MIAs (ten existing, five improved) to evaluate MIA risks on LoRA fine-tuned LMs across three tasks.

Result: LoRA-based LMs are vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC), with pre-trained models exacerbating risks. Dropout and layer exclusion are effective defenses.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models increase MIA risks for LoRA-based LMs, necessitating privacy measures like dropout and layer exclusion.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service (NWaaS) and ShadowMark, a method to protect DNN models without modifying them, ensuring fidelity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN watermarking methods are intrusive, raising concerns about model behavior shifts and costs, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Proposes ShadowMark, a nonintrusive side-channel approach using a key encoder and watermark decoder in the model's black-box API.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy across various DNN architectures and robustness against attacks, eliminating the fidelity-robustness trade-off.

Conclusion: ShadowMark offers a practical solution for nonintrusive DNN watermarking, suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models, eliminating per-instance fine-tuning and enabling scalable, high-quality synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic concept personalization require per-instance fine-tuning, limiting scalability. This work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Uses structured 2x2 video grids and lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for training. A Grid Fill module ensures temporal coherence and identity preservation at inference.

Result: Achieves high-quality, consistent results across unseen dynamic concepts and editing scenarios without test-time optimization.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable, efficient, and generalizes well, offering a practical solution for dynamic concept personalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GeoAvatar improves 3D head avatar generation by balancing identity preservation and animation quality using adaptive Gaussian Splatting and a novel mouth deformation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with balancing identity preservation and animation quality due to inadequate handling of facial region deviations.

Method: GeoAvatar uses Adaptive Pre-allocation Stage (APS) to segment Gaussians, introduces a mouth structure and part-wise deformation strategy, and applies a regularization loss for rigging.

Result: GeoAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and animation, supported by the DynamicFace dataset.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar effectively addresses the challenge of balancing identity preservation and animation fidelity in 3D head avatars.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

TL;DR: PS-GS integrates Gaussian Splatting with MVPS for efficient inverse rendering, improving 3D reconstruction accuracy and enabling novel-view synthesis, relighting, and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inverse rendering methods with fixed illumination lack accuracy. MVPS offers better results but remains inefficient.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting for initial geometry, deferred inverse rendering with a lighting MLP, and regularizes normals with photometric stereo. Introduces 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for lighting refinement.

Result: Outperforms prior works in accuracy and efficiency on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: PS-GS effectively addresses the challenges of inverse rendering with MVPS, enabling versatile post-reconstruction applications.

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Motivation: Existing MEP algorithms are time-consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem.

Method: Developed MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on crystal structures, integrated with iterative solvers via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS).

Result: Hybrid approach improves reconstruction quality, achieving a 90.50% SSIM improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: MEP-Diffusion significantly enhances MEP reconstruction quality by combining generative priors with iterative solvers.

Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that
computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over
existing methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) to non-biological technical features, introduces PathoROB for benchmarking, and proposes methods to improve FM robustness for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks posed by FMs learning non-biological technical features, which can lead to clinical errors, the study aims to systematically evaluate and improve FM robustness.

Method: The study introduces PathoROB, a benchmark with three novel metrics, and evaluates 20 FMs across four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. It also proposes a framework for FM robustification.

Result: Experiments reveal robustness deficits in all evaluated FMs, with non-robust representations causing diagnostic errors. Using robust FMs and post-hoc robustification reduced but did not eliminate these risks.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluation is critical for clinical FM adoption, and future FM development must prioritize robustness. PathoROB serves as a blueprint for assessing robustness in biomedical AI.

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study uses hyperspectral imaging and ML models to predict nitrogen (N) concentration in grapevine leaves and canopies, identifying key spectral bands for accurate estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nitrogen is vital for vineyards, but its variability makes precise estimation and management challenging.

Method: Hyperspectral images (400-1000nm) of four grapevine cultivars were analyzed using feature selection and ML models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).

Result: Key spectral regions (500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, 900-950nm) were robust for N prediction, with R² of 0.49 (canopy) and 0.57 (leaf).

Conclusion: Hyperspectral imaging combined with ML is promising for monitoring N status in vineyards.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

### [167] [Hierarchical Diffusion Framework for Pseudo-Healthy Brain MRI Inpainting with Enhanced 3D Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17911)
*Dou Hoon Kwark,Shirui Luo,Xiyue Zhu,Yudu Li,Zhi-Pei Liang,Volodymyr Kindratenko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hierarchical diffusion framework for pseudo-healthy MRI inpainting combines axial and coronal 2D models to balance data efficiency and volumetric consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D inpainting methods for brain MRI scans suffer from slice discontinuities, while 3D models require extensive training data, making them impractical in medical settings.

Method: The proposed method uses two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages: an axial diffusion model for global consistency and a coronal model for detail refinement, with adaptive resampling.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in realism and volumetric consistency.

Conclusion: This hierarchical diffusion framework is a promising solution for pseudo-healthy MRI inpainting, offering a balance between data efficiency and volumetric quality.

Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining
perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data
efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric
consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image
inpainting. Code is available at

*Deepa Krishnaswamy,Cosmin Ciausu,Steve Pieper,Ron Kikinis,Benjamin Billot,Andrey Fedorov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A benchmarking study compares three MRI abdominal segmentation tools and introduces ABDSynth, a model trained on CT data, evaluating their accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI segmentation is challenging due to signal variability and annotation effort, limiting generalizability of existing tools.

Method: Benchmarked three state-of-the-art models (MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, TotalSegmentator MRI) and introduced ABDSynth, trained on CT data. Evaluated on public datasets spanning various conditions.

Result: MRSegmentator performed best, while ABDSynth, though less accurate, offers a viable alternative with lower annotation requirements.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between accuracy and annotation effort, providing tools and datasets for future benchmarking.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights
for ABDSynth.

*Hang Xu,Alexandre Bousse,Alessandro Perelli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DEcomp-MoD is a deep learning method for material decomposition in DECT, combining spectral model knowledge and diffusion priors, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DECT material decomposition methods in the image domain ignore beam-hardening effects, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Proposes DEcomp-MoD, a model-based conditional diffusion model that directly converts DECT projection data into material images, ensuring consistency.

Result: DEcomp-MoD outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised methods on synthetic DECT data.

Conclusion: DEcomp-MoD shows promise for clinical deployment due to its superior performance and direct projection-to-image conversion.

Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.

TL;DR: Proposes TenVOO, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for 3D U-Net-based DDPMs in MRI image generation, achieving high performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of research on parameter-efficient representations for 3D convolution operations in MRI image generation.

Method: Introduces TenVOO, leveraging tensor network modeling to represent 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors.

Result: TenVOO outperforms existing methods in MS-SSIM, using only 0.3% of the original model's trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TenVOO is an effective PEFT method for 3D DDPMs, balancing performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural
similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in
capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable
parameters of the original model. Our code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconstruct missing or corrupted regions in brain MRI scans for improved diagnostic and research applications.

Method: Uses a U-Net architecture with data augmentation (random masking) for training on the BraTS-Local-Inpainting dataset.

Result: Achieved high scores: SSIM (0.841), PSNR (23.257), MSE (0.007), with low standard deviations, indicating reliability.

Conclusion: The method is effective, reliable, and won the challenge, demonstrating strong performance in brain tissue synthesis.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to synthesize healthy 3D brain tissue
from masked input images, specifically focusing on the task of 'ASNR-MICCAI
BraTS Local Synthesis of Tissue via Inpainting'. Our proposed method employs a
U-Net-based architecture, which is designed to effectively reconstruct the
missing or corrupted regions of brain MRI scans. To enhance our model's
generalization capabilities and robustness, we implement a comprehensive data
augmentation strategy that involves randomly masking healthy images during
training. Our model is trained on the BraTS-Local-Inpainting dataset and
demonstrates the exceptional performance in recovering healthy brain tissue.
The evaluation metrics employed, including Structural Similarity Index (SSIM),
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), consistently
yields impressive results. On the BraTS-Local-Inpainting validation set, our
model achieved an SSIM score of 0.841, a PSNR score of 23.257, and an MSE score
of 0.007. Notably, these evaluation metrics exhibit relatively low standard
deviations, i.e., 0.103 for SSIM score, 4.213 for PSNR score and 0.007 for MSE
score, which indicates that our model's reliability and consistency across
various input scenarios. Our method also secured first place in the challenge.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model for glioblastoma diagnosis was fine-tuned on the BraTS-Path dataset but showed poor performance on validation, with low accuracy, recall, and F1-score, though high specificity. It ranked second in testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastoma's heterogeneity complicates diagnosis, and deep learning could improve accuracy over traditional methods.

Method: Fine-tuned a pre-trained model on the BraTS-Path training dataset.

Result: Low accuracy (0.392), recall (0.392), and F1-score (0.392), but high specificity (0.899) and second place in testing.

Conclusion: The model has limited predictive power but excels in specificity, suggesting potential for refinement.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

Motivation: The lack of standardized, large-scale annotated datasets for TCM tongue diagnosis hinders AI development and clinical integration.

Method: Created a dataset of 6,719 high-quality tongue images annotated with 20 pathological symptom categories, verified by TCM practitioners, and benchmarked using nine deep learning models.

Result: The dataset supports multiple annotation formats and demonstrates utility for AI development, bridging the data gap in TCM.

Conclusion: This dataset provides a foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in TCM, facilitating AI integration into research and clinical practice.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis, while clinically
valuable, faces standardization challenges due to subjective interpretation and
inconsistent imaging protocols, compounded by the lack of large-scale,
annotated datasets for AI development. To address this gap, we present the
first specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis, comprising 6,719
high-quality images captured under standardized conditions and annotated with
20 pathological symptom categories (averaging 2.54 clinically validated labels
per image, all verified by licensed TCM practitioners). The dataset supports
multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been
benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and
MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource
provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in

*Yilong Hu,Shijie Chang,Lihe Zhang,Feng Tian,Weibing Sun,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UniSegDiff is a novel diffusion model framework for unified lesion segmentation, addressing uneven attention in DPMs and outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPM training and inference strategies cause uneven attention across timesteps, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal lesion segmentation.

Method: Proposes UniSegDiff with staged training and inference, dynamically adjusting prediction targets and pre-training feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms SOTA on six organs across multiple imaging modalities.

Conclusion: UniSegDiff effectively unifies lesion segmentation, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology by introducing a high-quality dataset and a prompt argumentation strategy, improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology suffer from data noise, incomplete annotations, and lack of reasoning transparency, leading to unreliable outputs in clinical settings.

Method: The authors construct a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations and propose a prompt argumentation strategy. They also use supervised fine-tuning and GRPO for improved reasoning.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% better structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors.

Conclusion: The proposed solution enhances accuracy and clinical utility, making it more reliable for pathology report generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.

TL;DR: The study evaluates four communication strategies in LLM agents for collaborative math problem-solving, finding peer-to-peer collaboration most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess how different communication strategies impact LLM agents' problem-solving in education.

Method: Examined four modes (teacher-student, peer-to-peer, reciprocal teaching, critical debate) in a dual-agent setup using GPT-4o on the MATH dataset.

Result: Dual-agent setups outperformed single agents, with peer-to-peer collaboration achieving the highest accuracy. Key dialogue acts (statements, acknowledgment, hints) were crucial.

Conclusion: Effective communication strategies are vital for LLM agents in AI education, with peer-to-peer collaboration being optimal for complex problem-solving.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

TL;DR: PosterMate is a design assistant using AI-generated persona agents to provide diverse feedback on poster designs, validated through user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in gathering diverse audience feedback for poster design and reconciling conflicting opinions.

Method: PosterMate creates persona agents from marketing documents, gathers feedback, and moderates discussions to reach design consensus.

Result: User studies showed PosterMate captures overlooked viewpoints and synthesizes diverse perspectives effectively.

Conclusion: PosterMate is a promising tool for collaborative poster design, leveraging AI for diverse feedback.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.
